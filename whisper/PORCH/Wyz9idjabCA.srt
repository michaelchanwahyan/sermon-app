 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:29,560
 All right, let's go, let's go.

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,800
 Porch, how we doing tonight?

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,160
 Welcome to our live locations.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,360
 Tuning in from the Porch Fort Worth,

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,760
 we have Porch Tulsa in a new live location,

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,120
 all the way in Scottsdale, Arizona.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
 And of course, welcome tonight to my friends

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
 here in Dallas, Texas.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
 Let's go.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,760
 We are heading into night two of our new series,

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
 like you saw, Fortune Telling, where

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,440
 we are committed for the next few weeks

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
 together to take God's word from the past, words

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,040
 from the past, and let them speak to your future reality.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,400
 Because you can go to Fortune Tellers,

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,440
 which we do not promote.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,520
 You can go to the internet and Google

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
 and try to go to people and counselors

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
 and all these different things and figure out

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,440
 what your future might look like.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,360
 But the reality is, is there's only one who knows,

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,480
 and it's God.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,600
 And tonight, we're going to see what his word has to say.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,440
 Last week, we asked the question, hey,

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,400
 regarding my future, will I be forever alone?

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,800
 And before I tell you tonight's question

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,880
 that we are answering with God's word,

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,360
 I thought I would ask you guys, do you

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,200
 recognize my friend here, DudeWithSign?

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,720
 Anyone?

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,400
 Anyone follow DudeWithSign?

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,880
 He's a phenomenon.

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,560
 7.4 million followers, I believe, on Instagram,

35
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,600
 all by going to a street corner in different cities

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
 and holding up a cardboard sign.

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,160
 This is 2021.

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,840
 And he holds up signs and messages

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,960
 like this, which I really appreciate.

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,520
 What's another one?

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,760
 Fellas, Valentine's Day is right around the corner.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,960
 You can use this sign to slide into someone's DMs,

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,800
 take a picture if you want.

44
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,120
 Last but not least, reminder to cancel your free trial

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,400
 before they charge you.

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,360
 Some of you are like, getting your phones out.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,920
 And when you look at DudeWithSign,

48
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,760
 it might just seem like something simple,

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,400
 but the reality is, is that guy's purpose in life

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,560
 now is literally, literally to carry a message.

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,520
 He is constantly using his life to send a message.

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,480
 And I start there because tonight,

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,960
 we are asking the question, will I be truly forgiven?

54
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,080
 Will I be truly forgiven?

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,520
 And the reason why I'm talking about a message

56
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,720
 and the idea of forgiveness is because I

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,200
 think the reason why a lot of us don't believe

58
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,520
 that our life, our future can be used by God

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
 to declare a message to the world,

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,680
 that God can't really use us because we don't actually

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,640
 believe that our future is worth using because we don't believe

62
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,520
 that we're actually forgiven from our past.

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,680
 There is something in your life that holds you back.

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,920
 There is something that Satan uses to tell you

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,880
 that you're unworthy.

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,920
 That man, if God's going to use anyone in this room,

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
 it definitely isn't you.

68
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,280
 You're just kind of the-- you just kind of come

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,640
 and sit in the back.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,040
 See you up there, top row.

71
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,000
 Much love.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,760
 You come here and you tell yourself,

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,960
 maybe God will use him or her, but not me.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,400
 And I don't know if that's because of addiction.

75
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,360
 I don't know if that's because of a secret sin.

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,120
 I don't know if because you've used your whole life

77
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,160
 to build up some image through Instagram

78
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,240
 and through your friends that you want people to think

79
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,880
 that you're living in the perfect Dallas life

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,920
 with the good job and the dog and the going down to downtown

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,640
 and hanging out in uptown and all these different things.

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,680
 I don't know what it is.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,520
 But you think, man, God doesn't want to use my past

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,560
 to send a message to people about him

85
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,120
 because my past is riddled with so much insecurity,

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
 so many mistakes.

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
 God might use them, but not me.

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,040
 And I would tell you that if you think that's true of you

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,960
 is because you might be believing

90
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,000
 that you are not actually forgiven

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,200
 and you might not have a right reality

92
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,080
 of what forgiveness actually means for you.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,160
 There might be some people tonight

94
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,200
 that you're not really even,

95
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,520
 you don't really even care if like,

96
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,200
 what do you mean God used my past?

97
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,520
 God used my story.

98
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,400
 What does that even mean?

99
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
 Like what forgiveness?

100
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,960
 Like I'm a good person.

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,920
 I don't have much to be forgiven from.

102
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,640
 Like, what are you talking about?

103
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,760
 And we're going to talk about that tonight.

104
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,080
 And we're going to do that by looking at a story,

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,200
 one of my favorite stories in the book of Luke,

106
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,920
 one of the gospels in the New Testament.

107
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 And it's this account,

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,480
 it's this story of an interaction between Jesus

109
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,160
 and two people.

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,560
 And it really hits home, this idea of forgiveness

111
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,280
 and what Jesus thinks about forgiveness.

112
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,680
 And the reason why we're spending a night

113
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,080
 talking about this idea of forgiveness

114
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,660
 is because if a person truly understands

115
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,920
 that they've been forgiven,

116
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,440
 if you truly believe that,

117
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,840
 and there's no telling what God could do with your future.

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,420
 So if you would, if you have your Bibles,

119
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,500
 open up to Luke chapter seven.

120
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,140
 Luke chapter seven, verse 36,

121
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,740
 is we're going to read a story tonight.

122
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,020
 It's going to be a little lengthy.

123
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,540
 So zone in these next few minutes together.

124
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,660
 And let's start in verse 36.

125
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,480
 Here we go.

126
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,560
 It's up on the screen if you don't have your Bible.

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,180
 One of the Pharisees,

128
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,700
 Pharisees are, if you don't know,

129
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,740
 just like a religious leader of that day.

130
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,000
 They kind of know all the rules

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,540
 and they kind of go around telling people

132
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,580
 when they're doing something wrong

133
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,860
 and when they need to be doing something right.

134
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,820
 They kind of take care of all the spiritual

135
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,100
 and religious rituals of that day.

136
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,940
 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him.

137
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,340
 So Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat.

138
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,060
 When a certain immoral woman,

139
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,920
 immoral just kind of means a very sinful person.

140
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,940
 When a certain immoral woman from that city

141
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,600
 heard that he was eating there,

142
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
 she brought a beautiful alabaster jar

143
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,500
 filled with expensive perfume.

144
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
 Just kind of think like Gucci of today.

145
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,880
 Then Jesus knelt before him,

146
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,140
 or then she knelt before him at his feet, weeping.

147
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,540
 Her tears fell on his feet

148
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,980
 and she wiped them off with her hair.

149
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,220
 And then she kept kissing his feet

150
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,780
 and putting perfume on them.

151
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,980
 And I know if you've never read this,

152
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,660
 you're kind of like, what is going on?

153
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,180
 This is some freaky stuff.

154
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,700
 And yes, it is a little weird,

155
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,460
 but I promise it's gonna end up being super beautiful.

156
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,440
 It's just stay with me.

157
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,100
 So when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,

158
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,700
 he said to himself, if this man were a prophet,

159
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,100
 someone that could kind of just like tell the future

160
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,220
 and all these different things,

161
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,260
 he would know that what kind of woman is touching him.

162
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,540
 She's a sinner.

163
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,260
 Then Jesus answered his thoughts,

164
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,900
 telling me that Jesus can read our minds.

165
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,140
 He just could read people's minds this day, which is crazy.

166
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,660
 Then Jesus answered his thoughts.

167
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,260
 Simon, he said to the Pharisee,

168
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,380
 I have something to say to you.

169
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,740
 Go ahead, teacher.

170
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,980
 Simon replied.

171
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,700
 Then Jesus told him this story.

172
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,540
 A man loaned money to two people,

173
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,060
 500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other,

174
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,480
 but neither of them could repay him.

175
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,940
 So he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts.

176
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,740
 Who do you suppose loved him more after that?

177
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,140
 Simon answered, I suppose the one

178
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,180
 for whom he canceled the larger debt.

179
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,740
 That's right, Jesus said.

180
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,340
 Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon,

181
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,120
 look at this woman kneeling here.

182
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,620
 When I entered your home,

183
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,140
 you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet,

184
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,300
 but she has washed them with her tears

185
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,900
 and wiped them with her hair.

186
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,380
 You didn't greet me with a kiss,

187
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,300
 but from the time I first came in,

188
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,300
 she has not stopped kissing my feet.

189
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,180
 You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head,

190
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,260
 but she has anointed my feet with her rare perfume.

191
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,260
 I tell you her sins, and they are many,

192
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,540
 have been forgiven.

193
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,560
 So she has shown me much love,

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,660
 but a person who is forgiven little shows only a little love.

195
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,840
 Then Jesus said to the woman, your sins are forgiven.

196
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,220
 The men at the table said among themselves,

197
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,700
 who is this man that he goes around forgiving sins?

198
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,200
 And Jesus said to the woman,

199
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,660
 your faith has saved you, go in peace.

200
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,420
 And so just to make sure you understand,

201
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,820
 we're really highlighting three characters in this story.

202
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,100
 First, you have Jesus who has come down from heaven

203
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,340
 as the son of God to take away the sins of the world.

204
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,620
 He is the savior of the world.

205
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,900
 He's a really big deal,

206
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,260
 especially in this story and in your story.

207
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,200
 The next one, we have the Pharisee, the religious leader,

208
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,460
 the guy who knew all the rules,

209
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,160
 the guy that had read the scrolls, read the Bible.

210
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,140
 And then lastly, we have a sinful woman.

211
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,900
 We don't know exactly what they mean by a sinful woman.

212
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,060
 We just know that she had a reputation of sinning a lot.

213
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,860
 Commentators think that maybe she was a prostitute,

214
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,020
 that maybe she had the reputation of a whore.

215
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,820
 But what the writer Luke is trying to get you to see

216
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,600
 is no matter what it was,

217
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,480
 her reputation was that of a sinner.

218
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,100
 But what's so funny is when you look at this,

219
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,060
 the person who knew about God, the Pharisee,

220
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,580
 was the one judging Jesus,

221
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,380
 saying, "Does this guy know who's touching him?

222
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,900
 Like, this guy must not be a prophet."

223
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,780
 Just sitting across the table, judging him.

224
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,260
 And the sinner, the one who doesn't know God,

225
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,940
 the one who's, you know, "What is she doing touching Jesus?"

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,700
 She was the one who was actually worshiping him.

227
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,940
 She was the one that Jesus was proud to be with,

228
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,740
 that Jesus was complimenting.

229
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,140
 So what did she, a sinner,

230
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,660
 have figured out that the religious leader did not?

231
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,440
 I think she understood forgiveness.

232
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,840
 I think the Pharisee didn't understand forgiveness.

233
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,260
 And that had radical implications

234
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,060
 on their response to Jesus.

235
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,000
 And I think tonight, your understanding of forgiveness,

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,220
 if you're coming in here asking the question,

237
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,380
 "Will I ever truly be forgiven?

238
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,180
 Will my past always haunt me?

239
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,060
 Will that mistake always define me?

240
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
 Can God really use me?

241
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,540
 Can God really use this story?"

242
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,180
 I think if you truly have the right view of forgiveness,

243
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,260
 it will have radical implications on your view of Jesus.

244
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,620
 Therefore, it will have radical implications

245
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,820
 on the way that you view your life.

246
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,100
 So I'm gonna show you how, through God's word,

247
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,540
 which leads me to my first point,

248
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,420
 on how to know if you will truly be forgiven.

249
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,600
 Step one, admit you have a problem.

250
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,900
 How do you know you'll be forgiven?

251
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,260
 You first have to admit

252
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,180
 that there's even something to be forgiven from.

253
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,700
 I think a lot of people come in here tonight

254
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,240
 and you're like, "Hey, I'm a pretty decent person."

255
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,540
 If right now I were to ask you,

256
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,900
 "Hey, one to 10, 10, you are for sure,

257
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,580
 if you were to die going home tonight,

258
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,540
 that you're going to heaven,

259
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,700
 what number do you think you are?"

260
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,320
 And I bet majority of people would be like,

261
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,420
 "Hmm, that's a good question.

262
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,420
 I would say I'm probably like a seven or an eight,

263
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,860
 a 9.236."

264
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
 And a lot of different numbers might be represented.

265
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,140
 Some of you are like, "I'm a two, I know it.

266
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,720
 I ain't afraid to show it, I'm a two."

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,460
 Some of you are like, "I'm 50, 50."

268
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,520
 And all these different numbers would come in here.

269
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,660
 But a lot of you, I think,

270
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,980
 would be sitting in that sweet spot of like seven to nine

271
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,220
 because you would admit, "I'm a pretty good person.

272
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,740
 I have never murdered someone.

273
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,380
 I've never, I don't go around intentionally doing bad."

274
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,760
 And you aren't willing to admit

275
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,260
 that there's actually a huge problem.

276
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,380
 This Pharisee, look at what the verse says here.

277
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,520
 "When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,

278
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,280
 he said to himself in his mind,

279
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,560
 'If this man were a prophet,

280
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
 he would know what kind of woman is touching him.

281
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,680
 She's a sinner.'"

282
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,600
 If he's willing to think

283
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,060
 that this woman can't have access to be with Jesus

284
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,340
 because she's a sinner,

285
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,940
 that must mean that he thinks too highly of himself,

286
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,480
 that there's something that he's comparing

287
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,140
 with her past and his past,

288
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,120
 and he sees himself as different than her,

289
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,120
 and he must not see himself in much need of Jesus.

290
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,260
 Probably because he isn't willing to admit

291
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,220
 that he's the problem.

292
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,740
 And I think some of you come in here tonight

293
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,000
 and you're like, "Yeah, Jesus is a good guy.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,380
 Yeah, Jesus is a good thing.

295
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,620
 This church stuff is a good thing,

296
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,380
 but like, I'm a good guy."

297
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,620
 And I'm here to tell you tonight, no one is good.

298
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,280
 All of us have a huge problem,

299
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,820
 and it's time that you start actually seeing

300
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,220
 the weight of your problem

301
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,860
 because you can never see and have the understanding

302
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,060
 of true forgiveness until you first understand the weight

303
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,220
 and the reality of what you need forgiveness from,

304
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,840
 your sin, your problem.

305
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,140
 Romans 3:23 puts it this way,

306
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,580
 "For all have sinned,"

307
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,740
 which means just anything you do to disobey God

308
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,300
 or displease God,

309
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,820
 something that you do against his word,

310
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,740
 something you do to serve yourself and not God,

311
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,340
 "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."

312
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,060
 Key word, all.

313
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,900
 Every single person in this room,

314
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,940
 every one of us have committed a sin.

315
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,260
 Actually, you have something called a sin nature.

316
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,620
 That means that when you were born,

317
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,420
 I did not have to teach you how to sin.

318
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,100
 I did not have to make you sin.

319
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,220
 You simply just had sin in you.

320
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,300
 When you're two and someone takes your toy

321
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,500
 and you start crying and screaming, "Mine, mine, mine,"

322
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,900
 it's because you're sinful.

323
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,020
 We were born with a sin nature, every single one of us.

324
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,900
 Therefore, every single one of us needs to start admitting

325
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,580
 that we have a serious problem.

326
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,220
 Why?

327
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,020
 Because God is sinless.

328
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,380
 God cannot be in the presence of sin.

329
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,540
 God is what we call holy,

330
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,940
 meaning that he cannot be with sinful man.

331
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,260
 When it says, "All have sinned and fallen short,"

332
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,520
 that means that fallen short means there's a separation.

333
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,420
 There is something keeping us from God,

334
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,300
 and it is our problem.

335
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,460
 It is sin.

336
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,380
 Therefore, we need a solution.

337
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,060
 Why?

338
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,140
 Because Romans 6, 23,

339
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,140
 "For the wages of sin is death."

340
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,580
 I'm gonna stop there.

341
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,980
 Just like in this story,

342
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,940
 Jesus, 'cause the man is not seeing the gravity of his sin

343
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,180
 and his need for forgiveness,

344
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,000
 he tells, he doesn't condemn the Pharisee.

345
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,840
 I love that, by the way.

346
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,700
 He doesn't condemn him.

347
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,540
 He loves him.

348
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,580
 He teaches him something.

349
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,640
 He uses this story.

350
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,780
 He says, "Then Jesus told him this story.

351
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,940
 "A man loaned money to two people.

352
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,020
 "He gave two people money,

353
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,420
 "500 pieces of silver to one and 50 pieces to the other,

354
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,720
 "but neither of them could repay him."

355
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,560
 What does that tell me?

356
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,380
 What is Jesus illustrating here?

357
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,660
 There are some of you coming in here tonight,

358
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,740
 and you're like, "Yeah, I'm a pretty good person."

359
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,360
 But I'm telling you, from the white lie

360
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,500
 all the way to the abuse,

361
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,580
 all the way to the 12 years neck deep in pornography,

362
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,780
 all the way to snorting cocaine,

363
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,340
 all the way to taking shots every weekend.

364
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,900
 Some of you, you might be walking in here,

365
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,980
 high tonight.

366
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,460
 Some of you might be planning to hook up

367
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,700
 after the porch tonight.

368
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,820
 Every single one of you,

369
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,540
 whether you owe 50 or whether you owe 500,

370
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,440
 that's not the point.

371
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,360
 The point is not how much you send or how little you send.

372
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,500
 The point is this,

373
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,100
 but neither of them could repay him.

374
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,140
 Neither one of them could pay their debt, what they owed.

375
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,980
 And in the same way,

376
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,940
 whatever you think you owe tonight,

377
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,140
 how much you send, little or a lot,

378
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,380
 you can't pay it.

379
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,180
 You can't.

380
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,380
 Therefore you have a major problem

381
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,300
 because I think if I were to ask everyone in this room,

382
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,900
 "Hey, when you die, do you wanna go to heaven?

383
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,660
 Do you wanna be with God?"

384
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,340
 I think majority of people here tonight would say, "Yes.

385
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
 I wanna go to heaven.

386
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,940
 I wanna see my grandpa one day.

387
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,100
 I wanna be with my family.

388
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,860
 I wanna be in eternity in a good place.

389
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,820
 I wanna be with God."

390
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,660
 So here's the problem.

391
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,140
 Left to yourself,

392
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,220
 you're sinful.

393
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,620
 You need forgiveness.

394
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,420
 You have a huge problem

395
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,940
 because God cannot be in the presence of sin.

396
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,520
 So before I tell you about how you're forgiven,

397
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,020
 I want to make sure that all of us,

398
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,740
 whether you've been free from your struggle for years,

399
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,780
 whether you're coming in here tonight

400
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,980
 and your problems are things like pride and lust,

401
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,100
 or whether you're coming in here and you're like,

402
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,500
 "Man, I've done some things that I can't even say out loud.

403
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,000
 I don't even know what the consequences would be."

404
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,500
 You have a problem left to yourself

405
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,220
 and you need a solution.

406
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,540
 And the solution is not you.

407
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,940
 The solution is not anything that you can do.

408
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,780
 Why?

409
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,900
 Romans 3 says this,

410
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,500
 "As the scriptures say,

411
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,620
 'No one is righteous, not even one.

412
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,420
 No one is truly wise.

413
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,340
 No one is seeking God.

414
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,020
 All have turned away.

415
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,660
 All have become useless.

416
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,940
 No one does good.

417
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,900
 Not a single one

418
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,140
 left to ourselves,

419
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,660
 we can do no good because sin is in us.'"

420
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,820
 We're born sinful because of the very first sin

421
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
 of man and woman.

422
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,540
 And since then, sin has been a pattern in humanity

423
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,460
 that separated us further and further from God.

424
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,900
 We talked about it last week.

425
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,700
 And so to understand, will I be forgiven?

426
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,380
 You have to first sit in the weight

427
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,980
 of what you need to be forgiven from.

428
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,920
 You've come here tonight owing something.

429
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,100
 I don't know if your story is I owe 50 or I owe 500,

430
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,020
 but you owe something.

431
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,260
 And like this story that Jesus told, you can't pay it.

432
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,780
 You need a solution.

433
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,540
 But before we get to that, just take a moment,

434
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,040
 sit in the weight of what you need forgiveness from.

435
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,480
 Because the deeper you understand your need,

436
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,680
 the deeper you're gonna understand point two.

437
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,520
 How can I know I will be forgiven?

438
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,520
 First admit that I have a problem.

439
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,520
 And then second, accept Jesus as the solution.

440
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,040
 Accept Jesus as the solution.

441
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,200
 Part of my story is at seven years old, I prayed a prayer.

442
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,700
 I came down front because my parents started going to church

443
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,840
 and I saw my parents come down to the front

444
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
 and pray to receive Christ.

445
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,800
 So I came down the front and I prayed this thing

446
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 called a sinner's prayer.

447
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,280
 And then immediately something in my mind started telling me

448
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,800
 okay, now because you're a Christian,

449
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,240
 that means that you have to convince the world

450
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,160
 that you're a Christian.

451
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,120
 You have to start doing a lot of things to come off perfect.

452
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,880
 And I struggled with an image based reality,

453
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,920
 a performance based reality for most of my life

454
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,400
 where I thought I have to convince everyone

455
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,160
 that look at JD and here's what I thought.

456
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,040
 I thought, okay, if I want people to see

457
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,600
 that God is good, they have to see that JD is good.

458
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,780
 I dismissed and I was not willing to admit

459
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,220
 that I had a problem.

460
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,560
 So what did I do?

461
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,360
 Instead of boasting in my weakness, I hid it.

462
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,200
 Anything that perceived me as weak,

463
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,680
 anything that made me look sinful,

464
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
 anything that I didn't want people to know

465
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,240
 that people would judge me or think I'm weird, I hid it.

466
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,680
 Hiding your sin,

467
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,640
 thinking that you're not worthy of forgiveness,

468
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,720
 thinking that everyone else can get forgiveness

469
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,160
 except for you, battling this idea of perfectionism.

470
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,240
 What you're saying with that is you think

471
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,240
 that you can be the solution to your problem,

472
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,540
 that you are the answer if you can just be good enough,

473
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,720
 but you can't.

474
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,680
 You're not the solution.

475
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,320
 You have to see and accept Jesus as the solution.

476
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,640
 Let's go back to the two characters of our story with Jesus.

477
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,440
 But neither of them in verse 42,

478
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,000
 neither of them could repay him.

479
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,880
 So he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts.

480
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,240
 Who do you suppose loved him more after that?

481
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,560
 Simon answered, I suppose the one

482
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,580
 whom he canceled the larger debt.

483
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,120
 That's right, Jesus said.

484
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,560
 And then he turned to the woman and he said to Simon,

485
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,200
 Jesus is gonna start to do this like comparing

486
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,440
 and contrasting between Simon and the sinful woman.

487
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,680
 He says, look at this woman kneeling here.

488
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,960
 When I entered your home,

489
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,260
 you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet,

490
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,160
 but she has washed them with her tears

491
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,680
 and wiped them with her hair.

492
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,200
 You didn't greet me with a kiss,

493
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
 but from the time I first came in,

494
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,440
 she has not stopped kissing my feet.

495
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,360
 You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head,

496
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,560
 but she has anointed my feet with her rare perfume.

497
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,080
 I tell you her sins and they are many have been forgiven.

498
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,760
 So she has shown me much love,

499
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
 but a person who is forgiven little

500
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,840
 shows only a little love.

501
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,480
 The Pharisee.

502
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,240
 I think he's a lot like us.

503
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,560
 I think we're a lot more like the Pharisee

504
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,600
 than we wanna admit.

505
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,380
 We are willing to be about Jesus.

506
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,820
 We are willing to put Jesus in our bio.

507
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,700
 We might have a cross necklace, a cross tattoo,

508
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
 a cross on our shirt.

509
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,080
 We might come to the porch.

510
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,260
 We might come to church.

511
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,080
 We might go to church on Easter and Sunday.

512
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,220
 And like, if people were to ask us,

513
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,960
 we're like, yeah, I'm religious or yeah,

514
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,940
 I believe in Jesus.

515
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,780
 Yeah, I believe in Jesus.

516
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,600
 Like I believe in Santa Claus.

517
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,500
 I believe in Jesus.

518
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,580
 Jesus is a good thing.

519
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,020
 And you might know all these things.

520
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,860
 You might know the stories.

521
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,140
 You might know about Jesus, but I'm telling you,

522
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,080
 I think a lot of us know about Jesus,

523
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,000
 but we don't actually know the Jesus of the Bible.

524
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,040
 We don't actually understand our need for Jesus.

525
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,780
 And we don't actually see Jesus

526
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,760
 as a solution to our problem.

527
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,600
 Why?

528
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,180
 Because when you face trials in life, you don't run to Jesus

529
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,540
 because you don't see him as the solution.

530
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,780
 You run to yourself.

531
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,000
 You run to pornography.

532
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,840
 You run to going out with your friends.

533
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,740
 You run to running back to that ex.

534
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,560
 You run to drugs.

535
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,360
 You run to that thing that you thought you would never do

536
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,580
 because something in you believes

537
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,200
 that that's the solution to my problem.

538
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,340
 I do something, I feel bad about myself.

539
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,840
 Therefore, I'm gonna go find the solution

540
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
 and you run to everything but Jesus.

541
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,440
 And a lot of us, I think our major problem is,

542
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,160
 is we actually just run to ourself.

543
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,680
 We think that there's something we can do

544
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,980
 that will make us good enough to go to heaven.

545
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,240
 I'm gonna keep pounding this idea tonight

546
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 because I even struggle with this today.

547
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,680
 And I've been walking with Christ for a few years now.

548
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,260
 I still struggle to believe that there's nothing I can do,

549
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,920
 that it's always been done for me.

550
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,080
 You know who understood this?

551
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,380
 The sinful woman.

552
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,440
 When she saw her need, when she saw the gravity of her sin,

553
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,560
 she responded rightly to Jesus as a solution.

554
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,700
 How do I know this?

555
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,160
 The Pharisee, the one who knew about God

556
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,600
 across the table pointing at her.

557
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,680
 Was she concerned about that?

558
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,700
 No, she just wanted to be with Jesus.

559
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,440
 That's what forgiven people do.

560
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,120
 When you truly understand the solution to your problem

561
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,280
 and you see yourself as forgiven because of Jesus,

562
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,760
 because Jesus is the solution, you wanna be with him.

563
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,120
 How is Jesus the solution?

564
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,280
 He illustrates it to this man

565
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,400
 by saying that there were two people

566
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,040
 that could not pay what they owe,

567
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,840
 therefore the man in his kindness paid for them

568
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,960
 and canceled their debts.

569
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
 And in the same way,

570
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,560
 the reason why Jesus was illustrating the narrative

571
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,140
 with this man is because he was that man.

572
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,280
 What he was saying to the Pharisee in the room was saying,

573
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,700
 "Hey, I'm gonna be this man one day.

574
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,520
 "But instead of just paying for 50 or 500,

575
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,480
 "I'm going to pay and cancel the debt

576
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,560
 "for all the sins of all the world."

577
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,160
 You wanna know, will you be forgiven?

578
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,780
 Yes, because Jesus left heaven, came down to earth,

579
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,480
 put on human skin and lived a perfect life,

580
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,880
 making him the perfect sacrifice

581
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,080
 because we could not do that and he went

582
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
 and carried every sin on the cross,

583
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,180
 past, present and future.

584
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,360
 Your sin today, he died for it and paid for it on the cross.

585
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,240
 And not only that, but then when he died,

586
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,440
 they buried him for three days and after that, he rose again.

587
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,600
 And when he rose again, he defeated sin.

588
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,840
 And when he defeated sin,

589
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,200
 that means that he said it's paid for.

590
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,880
 There's nothing else you have to do.

591
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,480
 You don't have to come and pay your 50,

592
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,760
 you don't have to come pay your 500,

593
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,080
 you don't have to come pay for that lie,

594
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
 you don't have to pay for that night you hooked up

595
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,200
 with so-and-so, or the night you raped someone,

596
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
 or the night that you were abused,

597
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,920
 or that abortion, you don't have to pay for it

598
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,600
 because it's been paid for in Jesus.

599
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,860
 You don't have to do anything else

600
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,840
 because it's all been done for you.

601
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,480
 That's the beauty of Jesus.

602
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,760
 That's how Jesus is the solution.

603
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,520
 You're asking, will I ever truly be forgiven?

604
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,560
 Yes, you will, because Jesus has done it.

605
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,300
 He has paid what you could not pay.

606
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,480
 That's what he's done for you.

607
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,460
 He's telling this man the story because he is the story.

608
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,560
 And what he did just a few chapters later when he died,

609
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
 that story is still true for you today.

610
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,680
 You don't have to wonder, will I ever be forgiven?

611
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,700
 You can be forgiven if you believe that this story is true.

612
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,480
 Romans says, "If you confess with your mouth

613
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,440
 "that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart

614
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,940
 "that God raised them from the dead, you will be saved.

615
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,160
 "You will be forgiven.

616
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,600
 "You will be loved."

617
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,800
 Not because of anything you can do.

618
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,120
 The Pharisee understood religion.

619
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,400
 The sinner understood relationship.

620
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,680
 We're not about religion here at the porch.

621
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,340
 Some of you, when people ask you,

622
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,120
 hey, what's your faith like?

623
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,720
 Are you a Christian or what are you?

624
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,500
 You're like, yeah, I'm religious.

625
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,300
 Yeah, I'm a part of a religion.

626
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,300
 We don't do religion here because religion is about doing.

627
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,220
 But that's what I'm telling you, there's nothing you can do.

628
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,780
 It's about resting in all that's been done.

629
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,960
 What we do here is we teach you how to have a relationship

630
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,760
 with the God who sent his son down to earth to die for you

631
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,920
 because he loves you.

632
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,640
 We don't wanna create more smarter sinners

633
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,280
 who can come here and point across the table and say,

634
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,200
 well, at least I'm not that person, or I'm pretty good,

635
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,440
 or at least I'm not that person.

636
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,720
 We wanna create people who wanna come

637
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,040
 and sit at the feet of Jesus and pour out their all to him.

638
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,060
 They say, yeah, I know I'm a sinner.

639
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,920
 I know I'm a sinner, but that sin,

640
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,840
 it did not disqualify me, it actually qualified me.

641
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,840
 It made me the perfect candidate to come

642
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,860
 and sit at the feet of Jesus and receive his forgiveness.

643
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,000
 That's what Jesus does for you.

644
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,240
 That's the invitation he has for you tonight.

645
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,680
 Quit coming and sitting around the table

646
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,960
 and knowing the things about God

647
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,760
 or hearing these stories and not being changed.

648
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
 It's time to get at the feet of Jesus

649
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,640
 because you've been forgiven.

650
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
 You don't have to be set apart.

651
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,480
 You can come be with him.

652
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,080
 You can come be a part of what he's trying to do here.

653
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,680
 And I think a lot of us,

654
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,720
 we like the idea of forgiveness,

655
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,320
 but it's actually a lot more harder for us to accept

656
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,340
 than we wanna admit.

657
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,720
 Some of us, maybe the reason why forgiveness is hard for you

658
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,160
 because you don't actually believe,

659
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,800
 like I've been saying, that you're worthy of it.

660
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,320
 You're like the sinful woman that you come

661
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,520
 and you will be willing to admit that, yeah, I'm a sinner.

662
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,000
 There's no hiding behind it.

663
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,520
 There's the Instagram pictures of me

664
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,040
 turning up on the weekends,

665
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,240
 or the girls around here know my reputation,

666
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,680
 or the guys know what I've done in my past,

667
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,160
 or my family knows that mistake I made.

668
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,400
 You're like, yeah, I know I'm a sinner.

669
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,660
 I'm not trying to deny that.

670
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,280
 I think the difference between you and her

671
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,960
 is that you don't think you're worthy to be near Jesus.

672
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
 And you don't see yourself as worthy.

673
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,320
 You don't see Jesus as someone

674
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,560
 who actually wants to be with you.

675
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,080
 And maybe because someone hurt you,

676
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,200
 or maybe because someone rejected you after you sinned,

677
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,240
 or after you made that mistake,

678
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,520
 maybe someone pushed you away.

679
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,040
 That's not Jesus.

680
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,360
 He says, you get to come.

681
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,520
 You're worthy.

682
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,680
 Every single person here tonight,

683
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,080
 if you don't hear me say anything else,

684
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,920
 hear me say this,

685
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,680
 I don't care what has happened to you in your past.

686
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,080
 I don't care what you've done in your past.

687
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,140
 I'm sorry, I do care what has happened to you.

688
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,800
 I do care about you.

689
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,600
 What I don't care about is the lies

690
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,080
 that the enemy will try to tell you.

691
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
 What I don't care is not how he'll try to use that

692
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,400
 to hold you back because what the reason why we say,

693
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,640
 hey, I don't care, JD, about the things that you've done.

694
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,920
 I don't care because I realized what's been done for me.

695
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,880
 I am worthy of the love of God.

696
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,600
 And so are you.

697
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,740
 You might have a struggle with this

698
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,840
 because you haven't forgiven yourself.

699
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,280
 First John 1, 9 says, if you confess your sins to him,

700
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,840
 he is faithful and will forgive you of your sins

701
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,360
 and cleanse you from all wickedness.

702
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,520
 James says, confess your sins to one another

703
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,820
 so that you may be healed.

704
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,980
 Talk about it.

705
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,760
 Forgive yourself.

706
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,280
 Be willing to say, this is me, no more hiding.

707
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,580
 I need to understand the forgiveness of Jesus.

708
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,560
 And maybe some of you haven't accepted this

709
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,720
 and can't really understand the idea of being forgiven

710
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,020
 because you're not willing to forgive others.

711
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,640
 Something has happened to you.

712
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,400
 Someone has done something to you.

713
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,880
 A parent abandoned you.

714
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440
 Someone abused you.

715
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,240
 Something happened when you were out of control

716
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,380
 and someone hurt you deeply.

717
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,620
 Someone cheated on you.

718
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,840
 Someone left you.

719
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,320
 I don't know what it might be,

720
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,960
 but unforgiveness has held you back for far too long.

721
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,620
 And it's actually prohibiting you

722
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,800
 from understanding the forgiveness given to you by God

723
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
 because you think if I can't forgive them,

724
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,500
 then how could God forgive me?

725
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,140
 And here's what Ephesians 4 says.

726
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,220
 Instead, be kind to each other,

727
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,160
 tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

728
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,540
 just as God through Christ has forgiven you.

729
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,360
 You want to know how you can have the strength

730
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,800
 to forgive that person?

731
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,700
 Don't rely on your own strength.

732
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,500
 Remember what God has done for you.

733
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,200
 It's through his forgiveness that we can forgive.

734
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,140
 Loved people, love people.

735
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,960
 Forgiven people, forgive people,

736
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,380
 not on their own strength,

737
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,840
 but because we've been forgiven.

738
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,580
 Life is too short to be held back by unforgiveness.

739
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,320
 Some of you tonight need to pick up the phone

740
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,120
 and call someone and say, will you forgive me for blank?

741
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,640
 Some of you need to call that person,

742
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,480
 and I know that sounds gut-wrenching to call them

743
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,800
 and say this,

744
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,920
 but you need to call them and push past that hurt

745
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,480
 and say, I forgive you for blank

746
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,080
 because it has held you back long enough.

747
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,240
 And it's time for freedom to take place tonight.

748
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,280
 And to stop letting that hurtful action define you,

749
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,400
 it's time to let go.

750
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,620
 I started tonight with talking about the dude

751
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,420
 with the sign that uses his life to send a message.

752
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,100
 And I want to challenge us tonight.

753
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,880
 When you examine your life, is your life a message?

754
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,940
 What do you stand for?

755
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,640
 If right now people were to write a story

756
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,740
 about what you're about,

757
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,560
 the message your life is sending, what would it say?

758
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,340
 I think for some of us,

759
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,120
 if we were to hold up our sign and send our message,

760
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,140
 this has defined us for a long time.

761
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,780
 Some of you guys have been in church,

762
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,380
 you've done every program, you've done everything,

763
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,580
 and yet you still have found yourself years later,

764
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,100
 still going back to this.

765
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,800
 It's because you see yourself as this.

766
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,600
 You think this is your story,

767
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,620
 but in Jesus, you are this.

768
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,780
 You are free.

769
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,080
 You are not bound.

770
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,260
 That does not define you.

771
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,340
 You can be free.

772
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,720
 Some of you, your sign would say this.

773
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
 Insecurity.

774
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,100
 Others focus on what they think about you,

775
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,460
 and it's time to find your security in Christ.

776
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,460
 Some of you, I don't know what happened to you,

777
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,340
 but when this moment took place in your life,

778
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,900
 and when you experienced abuse,

779
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,100
 I want to first say, I am sorry.

780
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,120
 I am sorry that that thing happened to you.

781
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,140
 Guys and girls, I am sorry it happened,

782
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,020
 but because of the blood of Jesus,

783
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,620
 that one night does not have to change your forever.

784
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,440
 It does not have to change your future.

785
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,280
 Because of Jesus, you can truly be washed clean.

786
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:11,280
 Some of you, like me, this word has defined you.

787
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,620
 Control, image, being perfect,

788
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,860
 thinking that you have to make someone proud,

789
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,880
 or this is what it requires to be loved by God,

790
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,800
 to do and say all the right things.

791
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,080
 You're not enough.

792
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,560
 You'll never get it right.

793
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,140
 But through Jesus, when Christ begins to define you,

794
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:40,120
 and not yourself, you can be enough in Christ.

795
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:46,500
 And I don't have time or enough cardboard to make a list

796
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,980
 and hold up a sign that represents everything

797
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,260
 that's holding you back from thinking that God wants

798
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,180
 to use you to send your life, to use your life,

799
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,820
 to declare of his goodness, despite your bad,

800
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,580
 and to use your life to send a message.

801
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,680
 And so you right now just need to fill in the blank.

802
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,580
 That thing that you think defines you,

803
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,820
 that self-righteousness that has kept you

804
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,820
 from needing more of God, you need to write it down.

805
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,060
 That night, that thing you did today,

806
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,860
 you're like, man, I gotta sit way up here

807
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,640
 'cause I can't be near Jesus.

808
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,900
 If anyone actually knew, they wouldn't want me here.

809
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,200
 You need to write it down.

810
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,100
 You need to see yourself as forgiven, forgiven in Christ.

811
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,820
 Yeah, you have a problem, but God loved you so much,

812
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,740
 he did not want you to just stay in your problem.

813
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,660
 He wanted you to be in heaven with him.

814
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,580
 He wanted you to have a solution.

815
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,340
 He wanted to be able to be near you, and it's Jesus.

816
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,560
 It's through Jesus.

817
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,840
 It's through his forgiveness.

818
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,260
 It's through the blood that he shed for you

819
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,480
 that you can be forgiven.

820
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,820
 And if you would start to understand

821
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,920
 the forgiveness that has been given to you

822
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,920
 by the death of Jesus, you're gonna start to see your mess.

823
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,160
 And start to understand that God can take your mess

824
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,600
 and turn it into a message.

825
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,400
 And that's what he wants to do with people tonight.

826
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,700
 He doesn't want perfect people.

827
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,680
 He wants forgiven people.

828
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,320
 People who will go out and tell people,

829
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,760
 hey, I'm never gonna get it right.

830
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,760
 I'm broken, but those things don't define me.

831
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,360
 Jesus defines me.

832
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,680
 And if you would start to look at your past

833
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,720
 as something that's been forgiven through Christ,

834
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,640
 there is no telling, listen to me,

835
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,480
 there is no telling what God can do with your future.

836
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,000
 Let's pray.

837
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,560
 Father, we are so undeserving

838
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,280
 because of the problem that we have.

839
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,440
 We are so undeserving because our sin is great.

840
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,200
 We're so undeserving to be in the presence

841
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,160
 of your goodness, of your holiness.

842
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,120
 But thank you that you take sinful people

843
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,440
 and you turn them through forgiveness into loved people.

844
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,520
 Like you told Simon in this story,

845
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,240
 those that have been forgiven much are able to love much.

846
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,680
 And so I pray that tonight,

847
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,800
 these people would understand how much they've been forgiven

848
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,840
 so they can go out and send out that much love to the world

849
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,320
 through taking their mess and declaring a message

850
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,880
 that God has saved them from their sin.

851
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,440
 Tonight, the person who does not believe

852
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
 that they can truly be forgiven,

853
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,520
 that they can truly be free,

854
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,200
 I pray that they would see Jesus,

855
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,960
 they would see the price he paid.

856
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,920
 They would understand that he came to take slaves,

857
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,960
 to sin and make people free in Christ,

858
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,880
 to take bound people, sinful people,

859
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,200
 and make them forgiven and sent people.

860
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,360
 And because of that, because you take our past

861
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,520
 and you tell a future story of your goodness

862
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,680
 just by our bat, we worship you.

863
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,120
 We trust you.

864
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,960
 We give our lives to you.

865
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,840
 In that I pray, amen.

866
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,240
 Let's respond in worship.
