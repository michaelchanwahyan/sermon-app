1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,980
 - All right, well, what's up friends in the room,

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,980
 friends in Indianapolis, Scottsdale, Arizona,

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,580
 Houston, Texas, Fayetteville, Arkansas,

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,540
 all the Port Salvation.

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,180
 Everybody tuning in, we are wrapping up, as you said,

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,460
 this series, Hot Take Summer.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,140
 Each week we have been starting with some hot takes.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,660
 And so I am going to give some hot takes to kick it off

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,540
 before we get into tonight's hot take

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,340
 or subject for the night.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,820
 Hot take number one, "Remember the Titans"

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,780
 is the greatest movie of all time.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,380
 (audience cheering)

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,060
 I am tempted to just make the rest of the sermon,

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,780
 "Remember the Titans" quotes.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,780
 And strong side, and there you go, okay.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,580
 Hot take number two, "If you are coughing,

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,580
 "congested, and sneezing, it is never just allergies."

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,140
 You need to go to a doctor, get some medication, people.

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,460
 This whole, "It's just my allergies."

22
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,260
 It is not your allergies if you have a fever, okay?

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,300
 Hot take number three, "The Fourth of July" is underrated.

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,620
 Top three, I think it's top three best holidays.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,900
 You got Easter, then Christmas, Fourth of July.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,800
 There, I said it.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,280
 Hot take number four, this one's hot.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,620
 I don't think it's that hot with this crowd,

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,940
 but it should happen.

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,140
 Hashtag free Britney, okay?

31
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,140
 (audience cheering)

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,360
 Hot take number five, this one is hot for this crowd.

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,460
 Every Taylor Swift song sounds the same.

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,060
 (audience cheering)

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,900
 Okay, wow.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,660
 There you go.

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,020
 Mix it up, T-Swift.

38
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,180
 Hot take number six, "Nobody should ever eat kale.

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,880
 "It's disgusting, and if you disagree,

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,280
 "you're lying to yourself."

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,380
 I don't even know when this vegetable was invented.

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,460
 It wasn't here 20 years ago.

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,140
 It's like the same lab.

44
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,980
 I'm not even gonna touch that, actually.

45
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:36,840
 Hot take number seven, "Crocs should never be worn

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,980
 "unless you are at the beach or the lake."

47
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,980
 (audience cheering)

48
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,660
 I know there's crocs all over this room right now.

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,460
 I don't know how they came back, man, but they are back.

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,180
 All right, here's a hot take that'll go into a story

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,260
 before I give us a hot take.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,020
 Hot take, I think the best honeymoon vacation spot

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,940
 is Cancun, Mexico.

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,700
 I can explain, I don't have time to go into it right now.

55
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,580
 It's very affordable.

56
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,020
 You're not spending your money on jet fuel

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,280
 to take you to Hawaii.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,540
 It's cost-effective.

59
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,780
 There's so many perks, and they have all-inclusives,

60
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,440
 which leads me to a story that'll get us

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,580
 into the hot take for tonight.

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,420
 A few years ago, because my wife and I love Mexico

63
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,380
 and a good friend who teaches here and was here for years,

64
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,580
 JP and his wife, Monica, they love Mexico.

65
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,420
 We have that in common.

66
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,180
 We'll do trips occasionally to Mexico.

67
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,460
 This was one of those trips.

68
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,380
 Booked this resort.

69
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,060
 It was a crazy deal.

70
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,060
 It was like seven days for basically $1,000 per couple,

71
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,620
 all-inclusive, everything included.

72
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,380
 It was just amazing and a really sweet hotel.

73
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,020
 We show up, we get there.

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,000
 Me, my wife, JP, his wife, go to the front desk.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
 You check in.

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,660
 It's just what you do.

77
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,400
 We're there to check in, and they're checking in

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,780
 with JP and his wife, and they say,

79
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,580
 sir, we have two sides, or there's two parts of this resort.

80
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,420
 There's the family side, and then there's

81
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,820
 the adults-only side called Heaven.

82
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,820
 And you will be in the family-friendly side, JP.

83
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,860
 We walked in not even knowing this was a thing.

84
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,260
 We were just like, we're here for the resort.

85
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,940
 And then they check in.

86
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,740
 They're going off to the room, and they say,

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,800
 Mr. and Mrs. Marvin, you'll be staying in Heaven.

88
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,800
 Man, wow, glory, did not, wow, this is,

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
 I was gonna happen.

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
 Yeah, there's a golf cart.

91
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,800
 It's gonna take you to Heaven.

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
 You can bring your bags over there that way.

93
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,640
 And so we're like, man, at this point,

94
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,720
 it's one of those times where you're like,

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
 man, I don't know whether to be like, no.

96
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
 We wanna be with them.

97
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,400
 And we're like, sorry, bro, deuces.

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,060
 Have fun at Chuck E. Cheese with all the kids.

99
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,320
 And they take us on the golf cart.

100
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,400
 We get over to Heaven side, and what I see

101
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,940
 as we get to our room was not what I expected to see

102
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,100
 in that there were paint tarps everywhere.

103
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,740
 There was construction workers everywhere,

104
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,860
 right outside of our room.

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,420
 They take us in, they put our bags down.

106
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,300
 There's a jackhammer guy right outside of our window.

107
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,840
 And I'm like, this is hell.

108
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
 This isn't Heaven.

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,580
 (audience laughing)

110
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,840
 This has been a mistake.

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,540
 And they put us over there because the resort

112
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,500
 was at max capacity, and the Heaven side was not open yet

113
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,980
 because there was still construction taking place,

114
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,020
 but they had run out of room, so it was just a small group

115
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,640
 of people that were gonna be over there.

116
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,500
 And I start there because in the same way that,

117
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,980
 in that story, Heaven was filled with people

118
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,820
 that it was not what I was expecting.

119
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,780
 In a very similar way, the true and actual Heaven,

120
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,420
 I think, is gonna be filled with people,

121
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,880
 and for many, it's not what they expected,

122
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,440
 or not who you would have expected,

123
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,440
 because tonight's hot take is a really important one,

124
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,420
 'cause it doesn't have to do with where you're gonna have

125
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,620
 seven days at a resort.

126
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,500
 It has to do with where you're gonna spend eternity.

127
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,740
 And the hot take, the first part of it,

128
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,160
 is good people don't go to Heaven.

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,240
 Hot take, good people don't go to Heaven.

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,880
 And being good is not gonna make you good enough

131
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
 to get into Heaven.

132
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,540
 This is a very common, candidly, belief,

133
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,400
 and I think it is one of the primary reasons

134
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,480
 people will spend eternity apart from God.

135
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,360
 Sadly, some of you in this room, at some degree,

136
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,980
 think good people are the ones who go to Heaven.

137
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,440
 If you live a good life and you try to be good,

138
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,840
 now, I think I'm a pretty good person,

139
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,200
 I'm gonna spend eternity with Heaven,

140
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 or eternity with God in Heaven.

141
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,720
 At some level, it makes sense.

142
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
 Of course, if you were God, or you're a nice person,

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,060
 and it just kinda adds up,

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,760
 most of the major world religions teach,

145
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,560
 hey, the key to having a relationship with God,

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
 the key to having an eternal life,

147
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,200
 is just be a good person.

148
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,080
 And so while it makes sense,

149
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,960
 there's a few problems that come along with it.

150
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,620
 One of them, as we're gonna see, is the Bible.

151
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,280
 But even if you stepped outside of that for a reason,

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
 I just want you to think about this question.

153
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,660
 There's some challenges that come

154
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,360
 with good people who go to Heaven,

155
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,720
 even on its face, take the Bible out for a second.

156
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,560
 One of those problems would be,

157
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,120
 there's no universally accepted standard of what is good.

158
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,320
 You could ask different people, like,

159
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,720
 hey, what does it mean to be a good person,

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
 or what is a good thing?

161
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,520
 And depending on who you ask,

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,400
 you're gonna get different views.

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,720
 Even the major world religions have different opinions

164
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,520
 on what is a good action and what is not.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,840
 There's certain major world religions

166
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,260
 that would say performing some sort of jihad,

167
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,280
 or attacking, or blowing yourself up in a building,

168
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,240
 will send you immediately to the highest level of Heaven.

169
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
 And then there's others of us who would say,

170
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,220
 that's not a good action at all, that's a horrific evil.

171
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,760
 But even if you just go on a more plain level,

172
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
 there's different standards that all of us would have

173
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,620
 on what is actually a good person.

174
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,220
 Some of you may say, hey, a good person

175
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,880
 saves sex for marriage.

176
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,480
 Others would say, no, a good person just,

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
 you know, they don't sleep around a lot,

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,400
 they save it for someone they really care about.

179
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,040
 Just two different opinions.

180
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,240
 Different opinions on what a good person would do

181
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,200
 in terms of how much money they would give away,

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,760
 or being generous.

183
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
 There's different standards or opinions

184
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
 on even what is good.

185
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,400
 There's no universally accepted, this is good.

186
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,560
 The other problem with being a good person,

187
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,540
 or if you do good, then you're gonna be accepted in Heaven,

188
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,800
 is we don't have the grading scale.

189
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,920
 Like, think about it.

190
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,280
 What is a sufficient number of good deeds?

191
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,760
 Is it 51%, is that it?

192
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,840
 You just gotta do more good deeds than bad deeds?

193
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,640
 Is the number, hey, you gotta do 70%,

194
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
 that's where the school grading system comes from,

195
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,400
 you gotta get above 70%, or else you fail.

196
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,240
 What is it?

197
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
 But the most important problem

198
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,980
 with why good people don't go to Heaven,

199
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,880
 or most relevant thing is,

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,940
 because the Bible teaches very emphatically,

201
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,160
 good people don't go to Heaven.

202
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
 And I wanna walk through a story

203
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,480
 that covers three reasons that enforce

204
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,640
 why that is the case.

205
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,940
 And to do so, we're gonna be at a story

206
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,680
 found in Mark chapter 10,

207
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,240
 and this is a story that's also found in Luke 18,

208
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,360
 it's a story that's found in Matthew 19,

209
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
 and it is a story of Jesus and an interaction

210
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
 that he has with a young man

211
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,920
 who asks a question that every person,

212
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,100
 at some way, or at some point in their life,

213
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,700
 everybody asks, and it's related to eternal life.

214
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,060
 So I'm gonna read it, and then we're gonna walk through

215
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,180
 those three reasons why good people don't go to Heaven,

216
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,740
 according to Jesus in the Bible.

217
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,540
 It says this, Mark chapter 10, verse 17,

218
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,980
 it'll be up on the screen if you don't have a Bible.

219
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,220
 As Jesus started on his way, he's walking with his boys,

220
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,660
 a man ran up to him, and he fell on his knees before him,

221
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,020
 and he said, "Good teacher,

222
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,600
 "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

223
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,820
 Jesus said, "Why do you call me good?"

224
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,380
 That's an interesting response.

225
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,520
 "No one is good except God alone.

226
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,240
 "You know the commandments.

227
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,280
 "Do not murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal,

228
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,960
 "don't give false testimony or lie, don't defraud.

229
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,540
 "Honor your father and your mother.

230
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,400
 "Teacher," he declared, "all of these I have kept

231
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,580
 "since I was a boy."

232
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,860
 I bet you have.

233
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,320
 Jesus looked at him, I love this, and he loved him.

234
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,960
 And man, that is just like Jesus.

235
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,160
 God, human form, looks at him, he's like,

236
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,120
 "Man, I like this guy."

237
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,180
 One thing you lack, go sell everything you have

238
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,180
 and give it to the poor, and you will have treasure

239
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,940
 in heaven, and then come follow me.

240
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,380
 At this, the man's face fell.

241
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,520
 He went away sad because he had great wealth.

242
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,220
 Jesus looked around at his disciples, and he said,

243
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,140
 "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God."

244
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,320
 The disciples were amazed at his words.

245
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,480
 And Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is

246
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,980
 "to enter the kingdom of God.

247
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,660
 "It is easier for a camel to go,"

248
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,680
 camel being that enormous, bigger than a horse animal,

249
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,620
 "to go through the eye of a needle,"

250
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,660
 as in like the sewing thing your grandma uses,

251
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,780
 "easier for it to go through the eye of a needle

252
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,820
 "than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."

253
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,740
 The disciples were even more amazed and said to each other,

254
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,700
 "Who then can be saved?"

255
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,720
 Jesus looked around at them and said,

256
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,940
 "With man, it's impossible.

257
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:00,940
 "But with God, all things are possible."

258
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,820
 So Jesus walks along the road,

259
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,860
 he's there with his disciples.

260
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,980
 All of a sudden, a guy walks up,

261
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,180
 throws himself in front of him.

262
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,980
 Matthew tells us that he's,

263
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,500
 all three accounts tell us he's rich.

264
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,060
 Matthew tells us he's young.

265
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,280
 Luke tells us he's a ruler, which meant basically

266
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,300
 he had religious authority.

267
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,940
 And so this guy is the total package.

268
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,160
 He's young, he's got authority or influence,

269
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,520
 and he's got money.

270
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,560
 This would be the equivalent.

271
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
 He's not just, in other words,

272
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,800
 sometimes you read stories like this and you think,

273
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,040
 "Oh man, he's just a bad guy."

274
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,960
 This is a good guy.

275
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
 This is the guy your mom wants you to bring home.

276
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,880
 He's got a J-O-B, he has got influence.

277
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,240
 He's a good guy, lives and follows the rules

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
 or tries to as best he can.

279
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,960
 This is Tim Tebow or Ben Higgins.

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,020
 This is the guy on "The Bachelor" you're like,

281
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,640
 "Yes, man, yes, yes, he's the one, yes."

282
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,600
 Not the guy that you're like,

283
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,880
 "Oh man, that guy is such a jerk.

284
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,920
 How does she not see this?"

285
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,700
 This is a guy that you'd be rooting for.

286
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,260
 Seems to have it all together.

287
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,320
 Certainly has the total package.

288
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,960
 And he comes up and he asks a really important question,

289
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,960
 a question, "Where or how can I have eternal life?

290
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,480
 What must I do to inherit eternal life?"

291
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,000
 And Jesus, before even answering the question,

292
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,600
 asks a really eye-opening question to him.

293
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
 And he says, "You just call me good teacher.

294
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
 Why do you call me good?

295
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,480
 There's no one good but God."

296
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,360
 What is Jesus saying?

297
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,920
 Jesus is readjusting how this man thought

298
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,240
 or saw the world that he, Jesus in other words,

299
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,680
 is not saying, "Hey, I'm not God."

300
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,880
 He's saying, "Are you calling me God?

301
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,420
 What are you calling me when you say that?"

302
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,580
 My guess is the man is just going,

303
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,120
 "Look, I was just trying to be polite

304
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,160
 and say good teacher."

305
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,200
 And Jesus is saying, "No, there isn't anyone good but God.

306
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,240
 Do you know that?"

307
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,660
 The first thing the Bible teaches related to this topic

308
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,420
 over and over, and that is clearly in this text,

309
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,560
 is the reason why good people don't go to heaven

310
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,420
 is good people don't exist.

311
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,320
 Good people don't go to heaven

312
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,280
 because good people don't exist.

313
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,360
 The Bible doesn't ever teach that,

314
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,240
 hey, there's good people and you got a good heart

315
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
 and just listen to it and he's a good guy.

316
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,820
 The Bible teaches that there is no good people anywhere.

317
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,960
 There's only a good God or the only one who's good, Jesus.

318
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,000
 In Romans chapter three, it says this,

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,200
 as relates to this idea, Paul writing,

320
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,240
 says in verse 10, 11 and 12,

321
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,600
 "There is no one righteous, not even one.

322
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,880
 There's no one who understands, no one who seeks God.

323
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,740
 All have turned aside, together they've become worthless.

324
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,160
 There is no one who does good, not even one."

325
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
 How about that for a feel good verse?

326
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,920
 Paul says, "There's nobody good.

327
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,200
 Grandma's not good, you're not good, mom's not good,

328
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,560
 guy who took you on a date's not good, nobody."

329
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,860
 And you know that for a fact, nobody is good.

330
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,680
 Because the Bible teaches good people can't go to heaven

331
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
 or good people don't go to heaven

332
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,080
 because there is no one who is good.

333
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,320
 As good as you think you are,

334
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,000
 I need you to listen to me very clearly.

335
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,560
 According to the biblical definition of what is good,

336
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,760
 no one meets that standard.

337
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,260
 I think if all of us were to be honest with ourselves,

338
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,100
 we have lived lives where everyone would say,

339
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,980
 "Hey, I'm not perfect."

340
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,180
 Which is another way of saying,

341
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,620
 according to the biblical definition of good,

342
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,620
 which is without anything wrong, we've fallen short.

343
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,100
 There's someone TikTok going around right now,

344
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,940
 I've been told, but there's a game that we all grew up

345
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,020
 playing as a kid, never have ever.

346
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,580
 Here's what I want you to do, everybody raise a hand,

347
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,820
 raise a hand right now, five fingers up in the air.

348
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,860
 If you got five, you got four, do what you got.

349
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,400
 (audience laughing)

350
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,740
 If you have ever lied in your life, put a finger down.

351
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,720
 If you have ever stolen anything, put a finger down.

352
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,800
 If you have ever cheated on anything, put a finger down.

353
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
 If you are about to give me the middle finger right now,

354
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,640
 put it, no, don't do it.

355
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,720
 (audience laughing)

356
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,060
 If you have ever lusted after someone, put a finger down.

357
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,000
 If you have ever coveted or had envy over someone else's

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,180
 life, stuff, things, scenario, relationships,

359
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,080
 put a finger down.

360
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,760
 If you've lied, stay with me,

361
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,040
 how many times do you have to lie to be a liar?

362
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,100
 One.

363
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,400
 How many times do you have to steal to be a thief?

364
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,760
 In other words, how many cars would the guy you're dating

365
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,740
 or the girl you're dating stole a car,

366
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,360
 how many cars would they have to steal

367
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
 for you to be like, yeah,

368
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,040
 I don't think that's a great character quality?

369
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,600
 (audience laughing)

370
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,440
 One.

371
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,440
 The Bible says in terms of lust,

372
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,300
 that if you lust after someone who's not your spouse,

373
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,440
 you have committed, Jesus says in Matthew chapter five,

374
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,440
 it's the same sin as adultery, done it at a heart level.

375
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,040
 If you've coveted or you've longed after somebody else's

376
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,340
 stuff, which some of you guys maybe have done

377
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,900
 since you walked into the room,

378
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,560
 that you've broken God's command, you're a liar, a thief.

379
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,720
 An adulterer.

380
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,120
 The biblical standard of goodness is very different

381
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,040
 than our standard, 'cause our standard, if we're honest,

382
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,200
 is really like, hey man, if they're good for the most part,

383
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,920
 they're a good person, that's what we mean.

384
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,240
 The biblical standard of goodness is if they're good

385
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,960
 in every part, they're good.

386
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,320
 My kids are three and five, I've got a son that's five

387
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,880
 and a daughter that's three, and they will drink milk

388
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,080
 for breakfast and get 'em out, give 'em their sippy cups,

389
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,160
 drink of their milk, sitting there,

390
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,960
 melting their brains with an iPad,

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,760
 and something happens often when you give kids milk

392
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,600
 is they'll not finish the entire thing,

393
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,120
 and it'll sit there, and then eight hours later,

394
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,940
 they're at the same dinner table, sitting for dinner,

395
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,720
 and the milk is still there, 'cause their mother

396
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,680
 is irresponsible, and, totally kidding, totally,

397
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,120
 she's much more responsible.

398
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,600
 Good grief, people, okay?

399
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,920
 Save me the email.

400
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,080
 Let me get an email.

401
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,600
 You really shouldn't talk to your wife like that.

402
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
 Just kidding, all right, anyways, they come back

403
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
 to the milk, and here's what happens.

404
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
 This happens so many different times,

405
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,640
 where they take a sip of it, and they're,

406
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,520
 oh, and they spit out chunks, because the milk

407
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,280
 has been sitting there the entire day.

408
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,120
 It's gross.

409
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,440
 If I was to take that milk cup and be like,

410
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,800
 hey, hey, hey, I got you, I go over to the sink,

411
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,920
 just scoop the curds off the top, bring it right back,

412
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,140
 would you drink it?

413
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,920
 Because you understand that even if I take away the curds,

414
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,320
 'cause I'm like, oh, yeah, hey, there's curds on top,

415
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,000
 but I got rid of those, and there's other stuff underneath,

416
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,880
 and everything's fine, you would go, no,

417
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,020
 there's certain things that if any part of it is spoiled,

418
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,460
 the whole thing is spoiled.

419
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,300
 Biblically, that is how it talks about goodness,

420
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,040
 that inside of every single person that is broken,

421
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,520
 and there's a sin nature, sinfulness to every human heart

422
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,840
 that doesn't allow us to reach the biblical standard

423
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,880
 of what is good, and if you grew up in church,

424
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,600
 and this is so huge, especially if you're raised,

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,120
 or you have some familiarity, maybe you went

426
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,320
 to Sunday school, or you went through confirmation,

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
 or you just kinda like, you know,

428
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,360
 were at some exposure to the church,

429
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,320
 you may have heard people say things that are really foolish

430
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,000
 and just not accurate, things like this,

431
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,440
 hey, the Bible is a book full of good stories

432
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,340
 about good guys, and you should try to be like those guys.

433
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,120
 That's not the message of the Bible,

434
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,580
 that's not even the contents of what the Bible has.

435
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,760
 The Bible's a book full of broken people,

436
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,880
 everybody who's messed up except one guy, Jesus,

437
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,560
 and all the other people are so bad

438
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,440
 that they kill the one good guy, Jesus.

439
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,240
 The Bible's not full of all these stories of good men,

440
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,040
 and just to use a couple examples of people,

441
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,480
 maybe you've heard of Father Abraham,

442
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,520
 heard of Father Abraham, had many sons, I'm one of them,

443
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,240
 so are you, heard the song, all that stuff.

444
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,200
 Father Abraham started the faith.

445
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,160
 Let's talk about Abraham for a second.

446
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,000
 Abraham, on two different occasions,

447
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
 was going into a new town, new area,

448
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,440
 and he was so afraid of the people that lived there,

449
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,680
 he looked at his wife and was like, man, you are a catch.

450
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,080
 I cannot believe you married me.

451
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
 I'm afraid these guys are gonna kill me

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
 in order to sleep with you, so why don't we just like,

453
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,420
 you just, you sleep with them, that way they won't kill me,

454
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,640
 and he lets his wife go into the homes

455
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,460
 and be around other men,

456
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,080
 basically pimping out his wife two times,

457
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,240
 which I think most of us would agree is two times too many.

458
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,640
 On another occasion, his wife comes up and she's like,

459
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,320
 man, I just don't, you're supposed to have kids,

460
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,920
 and I'm getting too old, I don't think,

461
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,320
 maybe you should sleep with the maid,

462
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,880
 and he, you know, the next scene is like,

463
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,600
 okay, if you say, and he sleeps and gets his servant,

464
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 that's Abraham, the father of our faith.

465
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,920
 And I could go on and on, David, King David,

466
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,720
 killed Goliath, man after God's own heart.

467
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
 David, one day, he's sitting at home on the palace,

468
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,240
 he's out watching and sees a woman on top of her roof,

469
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,520
 naked bathing, which isn't a great idea anytime,

470
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,240
 but he sees this woman, it's one of his best friend's wife,

471
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,360
 wives, named by Sheba, and he says,

472
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,560
 man, hey, go get that woman.

473
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,260
 Takes her into the home, sleeps her, gets her pregnant.

474
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,760
 Sleeps with one of his best friends, his mighty men,

475
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,560
 his wife, and then she gets pregnant,

476
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,640
 and David doesn't come clean,

477
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,760
 he decides to kill his best friend

478
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,160
 in order to cover up his action.

479
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,560
 We need to think about that.

480
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,680
 If that is a part of your story, God can do anything.

481
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,960
 But most of us would go, yeah, that's pretty extreme.

482
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,200
 You apply to the portion on, you're like,

483
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,440
 yeah, so last week I killed a guy,

484
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,640
 and then after I slept with his wife,

485
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,960
 and we'd be like, bro, we're gonna work on some counseling,

486
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,360
 and go through some stuff, and maybe call the police.

487
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
 This is a guy who wrote huge parts of the Bible.

488
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,160
 And so whatever sin, you come into this room,

489
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,320
 and you're like, man, I just don't know

490
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,240
 that God would accept me.

491
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,960
 If David was here, he'd be like, hey, bro,

492
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,600
 come back when you killed somebody,

493
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,640
 and you slept with his wife before doing it.

494
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,440
 The Bible is not story after story of good men,

495
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,140
 it's men that had faith, but had tremendous failure.

496
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,000
 Because good people don't exist.

497
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,320
 It's the first reason good people can't go to heaven.

498
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,400
 And then Jesus goes, and it's so brilliant

499
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,560
 what he does next, I hope I can even communicate

500
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,920
 how amazing, just how he weaves what happens.

501
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,060
 He says this, Jesus answers,

502
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:16,080
 in response to, what should I do to inherit eternal life?

503
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,840
 You know the commandments,

504
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,040
 and he begins to list out the 10 commandments.

505
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,080
 Don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal,

506
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,640
 don't lie, don't defraud, or manipulate and lie.

507
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,340
 Honor your father and your mother.

508
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,700
 The man said, teacher, all of these I've kept from my youth.

509
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,820
 This brother does not lack self-confidence.

510
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,520
 All these I've done since I was a young kid.

511
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,160
 He still thinks, man, I'm a good guy.

512
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,240
 Jesus, you're a good guy, we got a good guy club going on.

513
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,760
 Jesus says, he looked at him and he loved him.

514
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,600
 You lack one thing.

515
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,220
 Go and sell everything you have and give it to the poor.

516
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,100
 And you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me.

517
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,960
 Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful

518
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,080
 for he had great many possessions.

519
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,600
 What is Jesus saying?

520
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,960
 It's a really fascinating take,

521
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
 'cause it's like, whoa, Jesus,

522
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,200
 he just asked for eternal life

523
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,960
 and you gave him a list of things to do.

524
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,560
 Cut, all right, we're gonna run this one back.

525
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,840
 Jesus, here, the line is,

526
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,120
 walk him through how to pray the prayer.

527
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
 Jesus does something really fascinating.

528
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,560
 He's responding to the man of like,

529
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,520
 hey, what do I have to do?

530
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,660
 What actions?

531
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,200
 He's going, if you wanna play by the rule of your actions

532
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,440
 are what allows you to have eternity with God,

533
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,180
 the standard is perfection.

534
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,440
 And he lists out, if you notice,

535
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,480
 out of the 10 commandments, he lists five.

536
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,280
 He lists the back five, if you will, of the 10 commandments.

537
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,120
 So here's the 10 commandments.

538
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
 You may have seen these growing up in school,

539
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,880
 heard these before.

540
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,120
 You can read through the list.

541
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,200
 He lists out the five that have to do

542
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,280
 only with relationship with other people,

543
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,560
 only with kind of earthly, hey, don't kill anybody.

544
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,920
 Don't sleep with somebody who's not your wife.

545
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,200
 Don't steal, don't lie to them,

546
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
 honor your father and your mother.

547
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,080
 He lists out the back five.

548
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,840
 Why?

549
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,680
 Why would he list those out?

550
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,480
 Arguably the first three are the hardest,

551
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,320
 or the first two,

552
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,680
 hey, you shouldn't have anything

553
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,240
 as a priority greater than me.

554
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,320
 You shouldn't have anything that you worship

555
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,080
 or any idol in your life that you prioritize

556
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,440
 that's number two above me.

557
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,100
 Because in asking him to do what he did,

558
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,700
 I want you, if you wanna play by that,

559
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,000
 you wanna go commandments.

560
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,660
 You think that you are good enough,

561
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,920
 or your good actions could earn you

562
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,240
 a relationship with God,

563
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,800
 then I want you to go follow the first two

564
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,560
 and go sell everything that you have.

565
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,520
 Because the law is,

566
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,000
 there is nothing that is a greater priority

567
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,240
 in your life than me.

568
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,120
 So rich young ruler,

569
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,040
 I want you to go put all that money

570
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,440
 and sell it and give it away and display.

571
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
 There is no idol in your life.

572
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,080
 There is nothing of greater priority in your life

573
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
 and I am gonna follow you.

574
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,840
 Second idea from the text

575
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,520
 is that God doesn't want good,

576
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,260
 he wants you.

577
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,320
 He looks at this man and he puts his finger

578
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,620
 and Jesus does this and he does it often

579
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,240
 in anyone who follows Jesus's life.

580
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,100
 He puts his finger right on an issue of this man's heart.

581
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,480
 A part of his heart that he got tied up,

582
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,120
 hey man, I wanna follow God and I wanna serve God

583
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,480
 and I wanna do, check the box

584
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,320
 and I wanna spend eternal life with God.

585
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,040
 And Jesus, knowing he had great wealth,

586
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,880
 puts his finger on this thing

587
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
 that had taken ground in his heart.

588
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,160
 Puts his finger on a place in the man's heart

589
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,100
 where God was not his priority.

590
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,920
 And Jesus says, one thing you lack.

591
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,780
 It's really interesting that he says one thing you lack

592
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,740
 and then he gives him four things to do.

593
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,800
 Go, sell, give, follow.

594
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,420
 What is he saying?

595
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,720
 He's saying, I want you to give everything to me.

596
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:35,000
 I don't want your religious actions,

597
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,680
 I want your heart's affection.

598
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,120
 I don't want you to do a bunch of religious acts,

599
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,280
 I want a relationship with you

600
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,240
 'cause God is not concerned about good,

601
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,880
 he wants you, not good actions.

602
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,880
 Christianity is interesting

603
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,560
 because it is both hard and easy.

604
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,520
 In other words, to become a Christian,

605
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,760
 you do so in a moment of placing your faith in Jesus.

606
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,560
 I believe on the cross, you died for my sin,

607
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,920
 you paid for everything I've ever done

608
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,600
 and then you died and you rose again

609
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,680
 and I accept that payment for my sin.

610
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,380
 In a moment of faith, believing that,

611
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,220
 eternity has changed, your eternity has changed.

612
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,520
 So it's in both easy in that it requires nothing,

613
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,360
 requires coming to a place where,

614
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,120
 "God, I bring you nothing, I'll never be good enough,

615
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,380
 "but I don't have to 'cause you allowed me

616
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,340
 "to have a relationship with you

617
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,280
 "by dying on my place on the cross."

618
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,320
 It's both easy 'cause it requires nothing

619
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,040
 and it is hard because Jesus demands everything.

620
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,520
 What do I mean by that?

621
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,240
 I don't mean that in like some cultish weird way,

622
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,360
 like, "Hey, everybody put your keys of the car on stage."

623
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,240
 I mean, when you begin to follow Jesus,

624
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,360
 when you put your faith in Jesus,

625
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,600
 this is how people change, by the way.

626
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,240
 The Holy Spirit begins to come into your heart

627
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
 and kind of inform how you do things,

628
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,120
 inform how you make decisions

629
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,280
 and it begins to take everything about you

630
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,580
 that's not like Jesus and go,

631
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,720
 "Hey, hey, I want us to work on that,

632
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,080
 "I wanna change that,

633
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
 "I wanna move you through to where you don't date

634
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,320
 "like everybody else dates

635
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,600
 "and I know that's how you always dated."

636
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,960
 But he just begins to come in and just convict you

637
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,540
 and you just find, I'm not able to go out and party

638
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,600
 the same way that I used to, things just aren't as fun.

639
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,560
 It's like he begins to change your appetites,

640
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,880
 change your taste buds and things that were so normal.

641
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,800
 Like, man, Friday, we go to the bar,

642
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
 club, just gonna go hook up, find a girl,

643
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
 hopefully take somebody home

644
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,280
 and it begins to be like, man, it's just,

645
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,360
 ah, I don't even know if I can do it anymore.

646
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,480
 It's just, I can't just go through

647
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,880
 and, you know, hey girl, how are you?

648
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,040
 Do you have plans, do you have a Bible?

649
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
 And do you know Jesus?

650
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,000
 And it just is like he's beginning to change

651
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,840
 because he is, because following him,

652
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,060
 at first it requires nothing,

653
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,720
 but Jesus, because he loves you so much

654
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,840
 right the way that you are,

655
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,200
 he also loves you too much to leave you that way

656
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,400
 and he wants to change everything about you, about me

657
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
 that doesn't look like Jesus.

658
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,000
 It's interesting in that sense

659
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,200
 and it's very easy and hard

660
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,120
 and he looks at this man and he says,

661
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,980
 "One thing you lack, give me everything.

662
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,800
 "I want you to know I'm better.

663
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,620
 "I want you to get all your stuff together

664
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,060
 "and I want you to know that you can walk away from it

665
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,400
 "and walk towards me and you'll discover I'm better."

666
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
 And he's not doing that 'cause he's against stuff

667
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,320
 or hates stuff, that's where people get off.

668
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,260
 It's not the point of the story.

669
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,480
 The point is, I want you to experience I'm better.

670
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,380
 This man is confronted with, there's an area of his heart,

671
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,360
 man, I really just wanna kinda check the box relationship

672
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,880
 with God, I don't want everything

673
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,080
 and I don't want this relationship,

674
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,320
 I want religious actions, which a lot of people want

675
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,440
 because it makes them feel like,

676
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,360
 well, God owes me something now.

677
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,720
 He doesn't owe us anything.

678
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,760
 But he wants you and he wants to have a relationship

679
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,400
 with you.

680
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,560
 It's like this, there's a huge difference

681
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,440
 between friends with benefits and married.

682
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,460
 Can we all agree?

683
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,800
 Like a friends with benefits relationship

684
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,200
 is basically like, hey, I'm gonna use you

685
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,240
 to get what I want and I may do some things

686
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,700
 and be nice and not be a jerk

687
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,040
 in order to let me use you to get what I want.

688
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:40,400
 Marriage is you are what I want

689
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,760
 and I'm not gonna use you or do anything

690
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,340
 in order to get something else that I want,

691
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,580
 you're what I want.

692
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:55,600
 And the Bible says, Jesus, religion in general

693
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,320
 is a friends with benefits mentality.

694
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,700
 God, I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna try to check the box

695
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,760
 and just give me the line, how much do you want?

696
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,460
 How much, tell me how much money I gotta give you,

697
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,960
 tell me how much stuff I gotta give you,

698
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,800
 how much time, how many times I gotta go to church,

699
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,460
 I'll do all of that and then you have to give me

700
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,300
 what I want.

701
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,660
 That doesn't at all line up with what the Bible says.

702
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,640
 The Bible says, God wants something so much better

703
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,560
 for you, for everyone.

704
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,640
 He doesn't want religious action.

705
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,760
 He wants your heart's affection.

706
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,600
 He wants a relationship with you.

707
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,680
 Jesus wanted this man who he loved.

708
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,600
 I mean, think about it.

709
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,080
 If God in human form looking at him,

710
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,080
 he's like, I love this guy, I love you.

711
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,080
 I want you to experience and know I'm better

712
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,240
 than all of that stuff.

713
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,040
 And then he gives the answer,

714
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,640
 which is really the most important part

715
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,760
 of the entire message.

716
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,960
 Man walks off and he's sad.

717
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,540
 Jesus looked around and he said to his disciples,

718
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,520
 how difficult it will be for those who have wealth

719
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,960
 to enter the kingdom of God.

720
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,960
 And the disciples were amazed at his words,

721
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,120
 but Jesus said to them again,

722
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,480
 children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God.

723
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,200
 It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,

724
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,520
 which is impossible, than for a rich person

725
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,040
 to enter the kingdom of God.

726
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,960
 And they were exceedingly astonished.

727
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,320
 And they said to him, then who can be saved?

728
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,240
 Jesus looked at them and said, with man, it's impossible,

729
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,160
 but not with God.

730
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,760
 For all things are possible with God.

731
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,160
 Is he saying that money's a bad thing?

732
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,760
 No.

733
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,000
 Is he saying that it is harder for some people

734
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,760
 to enter the kingdom of God than other people?

735
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,680
 No, it's impossible for everybody.

736
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,840
 The point is not money.

737
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,500
 Even the question the disciple shows,

738
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,840
 the point was not money.

739
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,600
 They ask a question, well, then who can be saved?

740
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,380
 It's a really funny question,

741
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,960
 because if this was about money, the answer is clear.

742
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,560
 Hey, rich people, really hard for them

743
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,600
 to get in the kingdom of heaven.

744
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,000
 The disciples would have gone,

745
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,680
 this is something that poor people are in.

746
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,280
 High five, we are in.

747
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,760
 God wants everybody to be poor,

748
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,500
 pretend like they're happy, and yes, we're in.

749
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,980
 But that wasn't the point.

750
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,600
 In that day and age, the reason they were so shocked

751
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,080
 is there was a belief that if you were wealthy,

752
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,360
 it's because God had blessed you

753
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,200
 and you basically had been faithful

754
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,520
 or done good enough things to where God

755
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,080
 had blessed your life with financial.

756
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,280
 You were closer to God, it's the assumption.

757
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,120
 And Jesus says, it's impossible for everybody to get in.

758
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
 Let me read it again.

759
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,500
 Who can be saved?

760
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:44,240
 With man, on your own, with religious action,

761
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,220
 with being a good person, with trying to do good things,

762
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,840
 with giving to charity, with giving of your time?

763
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,040
 It is impossible.

764
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,560
 But with God, all things are possible.

765
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,200
 Good people don't go to heaven

766
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,760
 'cause good people don't exist.

767
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,680
 God doesn't want good, he wants you.

768
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,760
 And the final reason is good people don't go to heaven

769
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,960
 because doing good can't save you, but God can.

770
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,620
 Doing good cannot save you.

771
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:26,760
 No matter how many times you pray, you give, you act

772
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,840
 in a way that you think is good,

773
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,840
 it does nothing to earn your way to God.

774
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,440
 Jesus says it is impossible.

775
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,320
 Really the essence of the Christian message

776
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,240
 is it is impossible to do on your own.

777
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,140
 He wants dependence, not obedience.

778
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,640
 Dependence on him leads to obedience,

779
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,200
 but the message of Christianity is the way

780
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
 that you and I have a relationship with God

781
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,000
 is through, I got, I'm dependent on you.

782
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,260
 I'm unable by myself or on my own.

783
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,820
 And it's about dependence, not obedience.

784
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,800
 That dependence leads to obedience,

785
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,560
 but it is being dependent, God, I surrender my life to you.

786
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,520
 He really illustrated this in the verses

787
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,160
 immediately before this story.

788
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,840
 It's funny the timing of it.

789
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,280
 You know what happened right before this?

790
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,640
 Conversation he's having with this rich young ruler.

791
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,880
 Some kids are running up to Jesus and it says this,

792
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,240
 and they were bringing children to him

793
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,960
 that he might touch them and the disciples rebuked him.

794
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,880
 When Jesus saw this, he was a dignant to the disciples.

795
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,240
 So disciples are there, kids, people are bringing a family,

796
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,140
 like Jesus, hey, will you bless my child?

797
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,120
 Putting him on his lap like he's Santa at the mall.

798
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,120
 And they're like, hey, just hold him for a second.

799
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,960
 And Jesus is sitting there and they're like,

800
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,760
 hey, will you bless my child?

801
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,600
 And the disciples are like,

802
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,840
 man, who get those kids away from him?

803
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,800
 Who do you think you are?

804
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,660
 And Jesus says, let the little children come to me.

805
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,080
 For such belongs the kingdom of God.

806
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,140
 Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive

807
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,720
 the kingdom of God like a child,

808
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,180
 totally dependent, cannot enter it.

809
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,960
 Jesus' DNA, children were seen as entirely dependent.

810
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,800
 They still are today.

811
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,000
 I've got a three-year-old daughter

812
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,520
 who is entirely dependent on me.

813
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,580
 She can't change her diaper, she can't feed herself.

814
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,920
 The other day we're hanging out at a pool,

815
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,880
 she's in clothes, she walks straight in the pool.

816
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,800
 And it was like, oh my, okay.

817
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,760
 She can't even be alone by herself.

818
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,480
 She's totally dependent on her parents.

819
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,000
 And Jesus said, the only way you can enter

820
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,700
 the kingdom of God, that's heaven,

821
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:48,240
 is by being totally dependent on your heavenly father.

822
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,120
 You are not enough.

823
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,600
 But the good news is you don't have to be, because he is.

824
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,000
 And he has gone out of his way to make a way

825
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,640
 for you to spend eternity with him

826
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,080
 by trusting in Jesus, not in how good you are.

827
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,360
 The entire point, over and over, Jesus hammers.

828
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,240
 He gives a sermon on the mount.

829
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,640
 Sermon on the mount, Matthew chapter five,

830
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,560
 Matthew chapter six, Matthew chapter seven.

831
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,720
 Beautiful sermon, most famous sermon of all time.

832
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
 Inside of the sermon on the mount, over and over and over,

833
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,760
 there's haunting things that he says,

834
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,660
 where he says things like, you must be perfect.

835
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,520
 Because your heavenly father's perfect.

836
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,920
 Another occasion, he says, you,

837
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,440
 unless you are more righteous than the Pharisees,

838
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,740
 you will not enter the kingdom of God.

839
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,580
 Who are the Pharisees?

840
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,880
 He points at this group in the audience.

841
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
 Pharisees were professional religious people.

842
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,160
 All that they did was be good.

843
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,680
 On the business card, I do good, so you don't have to.

844
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,320
 They focused on the following God's law

845
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,360
 to greater degrees than even the law had laid out.

846
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,220
 They were the best of the best in society.

847
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,280
 And Jesus looks and says,

848
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,080
 unless you're better than those guys,

849
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,920
 you will not spend eternity with me.

850
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,200
 It would be like saying, unless you are fast,

851
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,280
 you will never be able to go to heaven.

852
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,800
 And if you asked, well, how fast?

853
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,620
 Unless you are faster than Usain Bolt,

854
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,940
 you cannot enter heaven.

855
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,260
 Usain Bolt's too slow.

856
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,400
 That would be the reaction, that's impossible.

857
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
 That's the point.

858
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,800
 That Jesus didn't come to set up some new religion

859
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,640
 and to make people good.

860
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,960
 He came to make dead people alive

861
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,680
 and to give away for you to spend eternity with God

862
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,340
 by giving his life on your behalf.

863
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,160
 Because no matter how good, and listen to me very closely,

864
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,720
 some of you guys have bought the lie

865
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,640
 that you're a good person.

866
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,440
 And the Bible, as nice as you are,

867
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,600
 I bet you pay your taxes, I bet you're a really good guy.

868
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,480
 You probably help your friends move when they need to move.

869
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,440
 You probably like show up and you like care for your grandma

870
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,000
 and your grandma loves the heck out of you.

871
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,360
 You, according to the Bible, are going to hell

872
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,440
 if you do not trust in Jesus, because no one is good enough.

873
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,920
 And doing good actions can never make you good enough

874
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
 because good actions or doing good can't save you,

875
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,340
 but God can.

876
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,280
 In Acts chapter 13, the apostle Paul says this.

877
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,560
 He basically lays out, this is Peter to Cornelius,

878
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,040
 and he's laying out like, here is what we are here to do.

879
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,640
 This is after Jesus rose from the dead,

880
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,560
 taking the Christian message.

881
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,760
 We are here to proclaim.

882
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,480
 Only through Jesus, there is forgiveness for your sins.

883
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,040
 Everyone who believes in him is made right in God's sight.

884
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,520
 Not everyone who behaves for him is made right in God's sight.

885
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,900
 Everyone who believes in Jesus and what he did on the cross,

886
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,140
 there is forgiveness of sins for that person.

887
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,080
 When they come to the end of themself,

888
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,460
 I'm not good enough on my own.

889
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,160
 They become a prime candidate to be the type of person

890
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,640
 who will spend eternity with God,

891
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,920
 because good people don't go to heaven.

892
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,380
 Forgiven people do, 'cause good people don't exist,

893
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,360
 but forgiven people do.

894
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,800
 And there is only one way to get forgiveness.

895
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,640
 You know what forgiveness is?

896
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,800
 Forgiveness is what happens whenever you have

897
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,520
 kind of a breakdown in your relationship,

898
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,440
 and you see that person, they hurt your feelings,

899
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,340
 and there's distance.

900
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,120
 Anytime there's been, you know, they did you wrong,

901
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,920
 or you did them wrong, and now every time you see them

902
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,920
 at Starbucks, you're like, okay, I'm out of here.

903
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,680
 Because there hasn't been forgiveness.

904
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,400
 It's what heals relationships.

905
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,880
 And God has offered forgiveness through Christ

906
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,440
 to heal the relationship, the gap, the distance,

907
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,440
 but not through your actions,

908
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,800
 through a moment of by faith saying, I believe,

909
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,480
 Jesus, you lived, you died, and you rose from the grave,

910
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,400
 and you were in doing so paying

911
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,100
 for everything bad I've ever done.

912
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,520
 And I can have a relationship with you

913
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,080
 not because I have a perfect past, 'cause I don't,

914
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,440
 and not because of all the things I promise I'll do for you,

915
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,680
 but because of what you did for me.

916
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,160
 And you can be forgiven and spend eternity with God,

917
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,480
 but not if you live trying to be a good person,

918
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,560
 'cause good people do not go to heaven.

919
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,160
 Forgiven people do.

920
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,200
 Conclusion, good people don't exist.

921
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,840
 God doesn't want religious actions, he wants you.

922
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,960
 He wants your heart.

923
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,320
 And he has offered the solution, which is him.

924
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,520
 'Cause doing good can't save you,

925
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,040
 but God, and trusting in him can.

926
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,480
 My son, and I'll close here, this past 4th of July,

927
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,280
 we're hanging out, and as a five-year-old,

928
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,760
 he was like, man, you're ready, buddy,

929
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,600
 we're gonna save you.

930
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,640
 He's like, man, you're ready, buddy, we're gonna stay up,

931
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,960
 you're gonna get to watch fireworks,

932
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,040
 which is like four hours past his bedtime.

933
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,560
 But he's jacked up on candy and like,

934
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,000
 where's the explosions?

935
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,560
 And we're hanging out, we're waiting for it,

936
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,680
 and he's just so stoked.

937
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,920
 And in fact, here's a picture, we're just at our house,

938
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,960
 he's waiting, he's like, this is the best.

939
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,600
 At one point he goes,

940
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,160
 this is the second best holiday of my life.

941
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,800
 I was like, that's amazing.

942
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,640
 What was number one?

943
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,520
 And it was just unusual for somebody to categorize it like,

944
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,280
 hey, this is not best, but number two, we just got it.

945
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,760
 I was like, what was the best?

946
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,280
 And he was like, Easter, definitely Easter.

947
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,160
 And as a dad, I'm like, that's my boy right there,

948
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,880
 that's right, it's the most important day in human history.

949
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,920
 That's what I'm thinking, I'm like,

950
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,160
 man, I'm gonna start parenting classes,

951
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,600
 this is what I should do for a living.

952
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,960
 Gosh, that's right, Jesus rose from the grave,

953
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,920
 and all this is going through my head,

954
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,920
 and I'm like, yeah, why?

955
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,960
 He goes, I said, 'cause Jesus rose from the grave?

956
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,080
 He goes, no, I just like the word east and er.

957
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,080
 (audience laughing)

958
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,960
 And when you're five,

959
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,520
 it's like, man, cancel the parenting classes.

960
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,520
 And when you're five, and you miss it,

961
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,400
 and you don't get it, it's kind of cute.

962
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,960
 But when you're 25, and you don't get the point of Easter,

963
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,960
 which is the point of life, it's not cute, it's tragic.

964
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,120
 And I want you to think about something,

965
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,680
 again, it's just a close.

966
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,160
 This man was offered something that very few people

967
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,920
 were ever offered in the New Testament,

968
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,560
 an invitation from Jesus, the most important,

969
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,700
 significant, influential person to ever live,

970
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:46,860
 an invitation to follow him and be his disciple.

971
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,360
 I mean, had he taken him up on it,

972
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,880
 think about this guy joins all the other guys.

973
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,840
 You got Matthew, you got Mark, you got Peter,

974
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,840
 you got James, you got the other James, John, this guy.

975
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,300
 And he looks Jesus in the eye,

976
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:13,000
 and he says, "Man, I'm gonna have to say no.

977
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,920
 I got a lot of stuff.

978
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,920
 And I just, I don't know if it's worth it,

979
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,440
 and I don't wanna miss out."

980
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,880
 And he missed out on everything.

981
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,880
 He missed out on walking with the one who not only made him,

982
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,320
 but he was made for.

983
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,200
 In hindsight, we could see it, and we're like,

984
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,760
 that was a bad trade, bro.

985
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,480
 What stuff, what was so important?

986
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,000
 You got a house, like some camels,

987
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,120
 like what was so much better than him?

988
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,480
 I got a hunch that there's gonna come a day

989
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,480
 in eternity where all the different things

990
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
 that just like this man, there's this one thing that,

991
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,280
 "God, man, I just, I wanna go all in with you,

992
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,440
 but I can't really surrender it, and I wanna follow you,

993
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,320
 but I just don't know if you're gonna call me

994
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,600
 to step out of this relationship,

995
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,440
 or change the way that I live, or change the way that..."

996
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,080
 I don't know, God.

997
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,040
 We're gonna look back, and for all of eternity go,

998
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,800
 "What was I thinking?

999
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,920
 I was so afraid to miss out on this.

1000
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,040
 I missed out on the thing I was made for."

1001
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,820
 (congregation laughing)

1002
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,920
 And it's tragic to miss out,

1003
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,880
 and to misunderstand with your five,

1004
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,840
 or it's sad, it's funny, it's whatever.

1005
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:44,040
 It is heartbreaking to miss out

1006
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,160
 on the one you were made for when you're 25,

1007
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,460
 when you're 28, when you're 22, when you're 35.

1008
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,480
 And this man looked it in the face and said,

1009
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,880
 "Nah, I don't know if he's worth it."

1010
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,760
 Only to realize for all of eternity it was.

1011
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,340
 And my heart for you, wherever you're at right now,

1012
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:11,040
 breaks at the idea of you spending eternity,

1013
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,880
 and you're holding onto whatever you're afraid,

1014
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,280
 "Man, if I just release this to God,

1015
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,440
 or if I really just go all in with him."

1016
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,200
 Afraid of missing out.

1017
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,640
 And my heart breaks at the idea

1018
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,240
 that you're gonna spend eternity having missed out.

1019
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,560
 And if you have never put your faith in Jesus,

1020
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,400
 you are like this rich young ruler,

1021
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,760
 who is someday, in some way, is going to ask the question,

1022
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,920
 "As I stare death in the face,

1023
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,640
 how can I know I'm gonna spend eternity with God?

1024
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,720
 What must I do?"

1025
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,680
 And I wanna be abundantly clear, the action is this,

1026
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,680
 nothing but accept what was done.

1027
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,800
 Done for you.

1028
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,040
 2,000 years ago, when God came in the form of a man

1029
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,880
 named Jesus, carried a cross,

1030
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,920
 had nails driven through his hands and his feet,

1031
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,680
 whips filled with nails, scraping across his back,

1032
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,360
 a crown of thorns placed on his head,

1033
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,080
 and he stared death in the face,

1034
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,120
 and it was the day death died for anyone.

1035
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,880
 Who will simply accept,

1036
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,000
 you will never be good enough to earn God's love.

1037
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 But the good news is, you don't have to.

1038
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,280
 You just have to accept it by faith.

1039
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,800
 I believe you, Jesus.

1040
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,840
 I believe you paid for me.

1041
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,680
 I don't wanna miss out,

1042
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,000
 I don't wanna live another day of my life walking through,

1043
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,560
 not knowing and walking with the one I was made for.

1044
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,200
 And I receive your forgiveness.

1045
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,120
 And tonight is your night.

1046
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,440
 I'm gonna pray.

1047
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,240
 And as we do, I wanna do something that we almost never do.

1048
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,080
 As we end this series,

1049
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,960
 I want everybody to just bow your head right now and pray.

1050
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,920
 I wanna give a chance for if you're in the room

1051
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,080
 and you've never put your faith in Jesus,

1052
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,640
 I wanna walk you through a prayer.

1053
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,240
 And the prayer doesn't embody our magic words

1054
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,440
 that save anybody.

1055
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,400
 The prayer is just a reflection of,

1056
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,080
 God, I wanna spend eternity with you.

1057
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,520
 God, I received that free gift.

1058
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,400
 It's just a reflection of something going on on the inside.

1059
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,000
 And if you're in that place right now,

1060
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,640
 out loud to yourself,

1061
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,240
 I wanna lead you in this prayer.

1062
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:37,120
 Father,

1063
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,880
 I have sinned.

1064
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,680
 I have done things and lived in a way

1065
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,600
 that is unworthy of you.

1066
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:59,400
 I know I cannot on my own do whatever is needed

1067
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,320
 to have eternal life.

1068
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,960
 But I can receive the free gift

1069
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:12,360
 that you gave when you died in my place,

1070
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,000
 on the cross for my sin.

1071
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,360
 And then you rose from the dead.

1072
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:26,360
 And everything I've ever done was paid for.

1073
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,840
 I believe that.

1074
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:35,440
 I know I will spend eternity with you

1075
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,040
 because I believe that.

1076
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,600
 Take my life and use it for your name

1077
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,320
 and your kingdom.

1078
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,960
 Jesus' name, amen.
