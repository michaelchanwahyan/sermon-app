00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 - Hey, girl, what you doing?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,300
 - Oh, I actually just downloaded another dating app.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,300
 - Oh, my gosh, show me.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,000
 - More apps, more chances, though, right?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 - Absolutely. - This one's called Instadate,

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 and I think it's the one. Let's check it out.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 That was fast.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 - Hi, there. You want to work out?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 - Hi-oh, the name's Bob, zoology major from Northwest--

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 - Absolutely.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 - Winter Smith, you'd like to slackline?

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 - Oh, swipe left.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 - Name's Clarence, 47 years old.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I really dig kittens. - Oh, yeah, you do.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 - Ciao, Bella. My name is Giuseppe.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 You love me?

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Oh, she don't love me.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 - What is up, girl? My name is Will.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 God's Will.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 - Okay, swipe left.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 - This dude's back again.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 - Just trying to be persistent.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 - All right, go Bears.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 - Hi, I'm looking for the small group study rooms.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Can y'all tell me where that is?

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 - Oh, swipe right. Swipe right.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 - What are you doing?

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 - Oh, you're not on Instadate.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 - Nope, just looking for the small group rooms.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Do y'all know where those are?

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 - Yeah, I know where those are at.

33
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 - Do you mind showing me?

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 - Sylvia, whip left.

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 - Okay, sure, right over here.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 - I'm Cody.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 - Oh, Sylvia.

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 - It's good to meet you.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 - Nice to meet you.

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 - All right, well, hello, Porsche.

43
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I am not JP. I heard it right here.

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I love it. I ain't JP.

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 [laughter]

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 That's what he said right here.

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 [laughter]

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Sister, stand up and swipe left.

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 That's what I say right there to that side.

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 [laughter]

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 All right. There we go.

52
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I love that. That's good.

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I am not JP, all right?

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I am Todd, but what you need to know

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 is long before there were apps and smartphones,

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I swiped right almost 25 years ago,

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 and it has been the greatest blessing of my life.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Her name is Alex.

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 [cheers and applause]

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And I'm gonna tell you how I knew to swipe right on that gal.

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 There was a lot about Alex

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 that was exceedingly attractive to me.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Namely, it was obvious to me

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 that Alex Wagner did not need me to be complete.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 This was a gal that I saw a lot of guys pursue.

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 She was not getting her identity from men.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 She wasn't getting her identity from me.

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 This was a woman that was secure.

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So here's the deal.

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I was a guy that was in leadership at that time

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 and had opportunities to stand before a lot of individuals

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 just like this when I was single,

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 and so because of my position a little bit,

74
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 there were times that it was a way

75
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 to maybe get just a little bit of personal encouragement,

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 if you will, from some people if they were nearer to me

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 just 'cause that's the way our crazy world works.

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Sometimes if you're in a position, if you have power,

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 if you have beauty, if you're well-funded,

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 you know, folks wanna be around you

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and tell people that they're around you a little bit,

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 and I noticed that Alex didn't really need

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 any of that affirmation that would come

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 from some guy that was in some fleeting position.

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Now this was really encouraging to me

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 because the position that I was in

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 was one not unlike, you know, D. Marv or Luke or JP

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 would be in in this setting right here,

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 but the truth is is I knew that I was not,

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 no matter who I thought I was,

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 a guy that if a girl really got to know me

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 would forever be satisfied.

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I was committed to doing everything I could

94
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 to care for a girl, love a girl, and encourage a girl,

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 but I knew if she married me and I was her God,

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 it wasn't gonna be long before she left this idol

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 and tried to find someplace else to have her needs met.

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And so it was an incredibly encouraging thing to me

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 when there was a girl who knew she didn't need me,

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 but saw where I was running,

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 and I saw where she was running,

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 and we were running the same direction

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 about the same pace, which was with all we had,

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and we thought, you know what?

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Why don't we run together?

106
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And thus began the story that's 25 years old

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 of Todd and Alex Wagner,

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 and it has been a ride.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Now listen, we're doing a little series here at the porch

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 called Save the Date,

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 and last week JP talked about reasons

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 why it might be okay to go ahead and get married.

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 There's good reasons to get married.

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 The Bible says one thing about marriage

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 that is a guaranteed promise,

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 and that is that such will have trouble in this life.

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Now it also says that there is a purpose to marriage,

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 and the purpose of marriage is not to give you trouble,

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 but when Paul's talking about that in 1 Corinthians 7,

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 he's just saying, listen, if you marry,

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 and the Holy Spirit, Paul was single,

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 made Paul, put in there Paul, as you're writing,

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and you tell them that you wish they would remain single

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 so they'd be fully focused on the mission at hand,

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 and we've done a great job in this series

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 of talking about whether you marry one day or not,

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 you are not married today,

128
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 and so you ought to be doing today

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 things that you won't be able to do when you are married.

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 For me, one of those things was to serve Christ

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 in a very focused way,

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 to have lots of time to study the Bible,

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 memorize the Bible, read the Bible,

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 pour into younger men,

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 raise a golden retriever to be an amazing specimen

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 of what a dog should be.

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 You need to know this.

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I had an amazing dog.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 He was in my wedding.

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 He was the ring bearer in my wedding.

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I knew I married a good woman when the mother-in-law said,

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 and I asked for her hand in marriage,

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 yes, if Caleb is in the wedding,

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 and I go, well, we're not sure how we're gonna do that.

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 She goes, you'll figure it out.

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 That dog can do anything, and so he was.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 We cuff-linked him up, shampooed that brother,

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 and we had him come in,

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 and he gave the ring away to me

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 as he came down the aisle, you know,

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 and then he came up and sat right here.

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 I leaned down, whispered in his ear.

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 You know, he knew to raise his paw when I did that.

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 He slapped it in my hand, and then I just pointed,

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 and he kind of ran out,

156
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 didn't pee on the flowers on the way out, thank God,

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 and just left.

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I have since bought another golden retriever.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Let me tell you what you cannot do

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 when you're married and have six kids.

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Raise another awesome dog, all right?

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 So while you're single, get a dog,

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 train it to do amazing things, right?

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Caleb could do that.

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I'd use him to speak.

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I'd use him lots of places for illustrations.

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I could be in my house with a bunch of friends,

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 and I'd seen a Stroh's Beer commercial

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 where the guy taught a dog to go in there

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 and get stuff for him,

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 and so I taught Crockett to go fetch me a cold one.

172
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I tied a sock around the little handle of the fridge,

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 and when I was sitting there with him,

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I said, "Hey, Crockett,"

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 or actually, that's my new dog that can't do anything,

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 all right, "Caleb, go fetch me a cold one,"

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 and so he would go in, he'd pull that sock,

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 he'd open the door to the fridge,

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 he'd grab a Mountain Dew or a Pepsi,

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 whatever it was I was drinking at that time,

181
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 he'd bring, he'd nose that thing shut,

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 he'd bring it in there and drop it to me,

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 and it was a great party trick, a lot of fun.

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 So something you can do when you're single

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 is raise a good dog.

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 I don't recommend you make that your focus, all right?

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 (audience laughing)

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 But if you ever want a good dog,

189
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 don't wait 'til you're married with children.

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Okay, side note, file that, move on, I'm okay.

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 All right.

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 (audience laughing)

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 What I did do, though,

194
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 is I was committed in a way that was appropriate.

195
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 I was not focused on serving a woman while I was single.

196
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I was focused, as a servant of Christ,

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 in being a steward of his mysteries

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and advancing his kingdom,

199
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 of growing in Christlikeness in every way that I could.

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Now I am focused on advancing his kingdom,

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 growing in Christlikeness in every way that I can,

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 being a good servant of his,

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and loving this woman in the way that he loves me.

204
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And can I tell you something?

205
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That is really difficult for me.

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 It is a all-consuming job for me,

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 and it's a source of glory to God when you do it right.

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's a source of blessing to you,

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 but there is trouble in covenanting with another person

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 to say, "I'm gonna move towards you the rest of my life,

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 "and together we're going to do

212
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 "what both of us wanted to do alone."

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 JP talked about good reasons that you should date,

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 and let me tell you why you should date.

215
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 You should date because you have an intention

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 to yoke with another person

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 for the purpose of bringing glory to God

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 and multiplying a godly heritage.

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 By the way, if you are single,

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 you should live for the purpose of bringing glory to God

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 and multiplying a godly heritage,

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 not through children that you introduce

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 to your discipleship program through biological reproduction,

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 but by multiplying yourself out in other individuals.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 I've got spiritual children all over this city.

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I've got six biological children

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 that have been through a discipleship program in my house

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 that I have set free into the world.

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 I was stewards of those lives,

230
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 and my wife and I together have sought to love each other

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 in a way that they would see the mystery of the Godhead,

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 which I'm gonna explain to you,

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 that together we could rule the world

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 better than either one of us could ourself,

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 that we could multiply a godly heritage

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 as we brought to bear all that God built into me as a father

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 and all that God built into her as a mother,

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 that we could mutually sharpen and complete each other

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 in a way that only two people that are around each other

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 all the time could,

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 and we could model what unconditional, unforsaking love was

242
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 and what right response was to it.

243
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 When I got married, Alex and I both understood

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 that was the mission.

245
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 In other words, when you go to get married,

246
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 the way that you can know, if you will,

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 to marry right or to swipe right in today's Tinder phraseology

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 is you better marry somebody that has a picture of marriage

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 that is consistent with yours.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 There is nothing more destructive to the architecture of a house

251
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 or the assembly of a building

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 than if there are two people that are building

253
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 on different blueprints.

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Proverbs 23 says this,

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 "By wisdom a house is built,

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 "and by understanding it is established,

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 "and by knowledge its rooms are filled

258
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 "with precious and good things."

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And so if Alex and I have got a different blueprint,

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 a different design for what the family should look like,

261
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 it will not go well with us.

262
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 This is not about where you put the furniture

263
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 or what color you paint the wall.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 I'm talking about the foundation you pour

265
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 and where you put the beams

266
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 and where the bedroom is and where the fireplace is.

267
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And if there's a disagreement about where you build fires,

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 your house is destroyed.

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And so what I want to do tonight in the Save the Date series

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 is to talk to you about the blueprint for marriage.

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 If it is true, and it is,

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 that the purpose of dating is that you would see

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 if this is a person that is going to build the way that I build

274
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 and invest the way that I invest,

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and that I might get to know if we are together committed

276
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 to what God wants us to be committed to,

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 then you ought to know what you're committed to.

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And so that's what we're going to talk about tonight.

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 You've got to figure out who your master is.

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Once you figure out who your master is,

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 that will determine your mission.

282
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And once you determine your mission,

283
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 then you can say, "Okay, if I do hook up,

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 "if I do have a mate,

285
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 "it better be somebody who's got the same master

286
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 "so they'll have the same mission,

287
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 "and I'll lock arms with them."

288
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So the very first question you've got to ask yourself is,

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 "Who's your master?

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 "Who is the Lord in your life?"

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 If it's you, and by the way,

292
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 this is the reason most people date,

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 because they're their own master,

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 and they want to enslave you so they can serve their master.

295
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Those are dangerous people.

296
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 And they want to use you for their pleasure.

297
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 You are their play toy, their play thing,

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 and they are a playboy,

299
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 and when you play with boys, they hurt you.

300
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And what I'm going to recommend to you tonight

301
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 is that you find a man,

302
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 and you find a woman who fears the Lord,

303
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 and not whose beauty is charming,

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 deceitful, and vain.

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I told my son as I just unleashed him

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 onto a college campus,

307
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 and we were walking there at the University of Arkansas,

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 I was getting ready to drop him off,

309
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 and I'm walking around,

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 and I am seeing one pretty little Arkansas cutie after another

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 as I'm walking across this campus.

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 All right?

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 And I'm just kind of watching him,

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 and Dad's there, so he's not kind of doing this action,

315
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 but he's noticing what I'm noticing.

316
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 We are visual people.

317
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We have eyes.

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 We can see.

319
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And so there's cute girls that are everywhere.

320
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And so I'm walking with his younger brother and his mom,

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and I finally put my arm on his shoulder,

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 and I say, "Hey, slow down.

323
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 "Slow down.

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 "Come on back here with me for a second."

325
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 [laughter]

326
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 You know, "What, did you see her too?

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 "Let's check her out."

328
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 No, that's not why I'm slowing down.

329
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 [laughter]

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Not why I'm slowing down.

331
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 What I said to him, I go, "Hey, Coop, man,

332
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 "do you see--what I said,

333
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 "do you see all the beautiful women

334
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 "that you're going to go to this college with?"

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And he gives me this 18-year-old look.

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 "What? No. What?"

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 [laughter]

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I go, "What?

339
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 "Do we need to eyes check before you go to college?

340
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 "Do we have to read things?

341
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 "They're everywhere."

342
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 He goes, "Well, I don't know."

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I go, "Bro, they're everywhere.

344
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 "There's pretty girls everywhere, okay?"

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I said, "Let me ask you a question.

346
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 "What do you think when you see these pretty girls?

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 "'Cause you should see 'em."

348
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 [laughter]

349
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And so he gives me--

350
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I don't know.

351
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Nothing.

352
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 I go, "No, bro, you--

353
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 "You want me to tell you what you should think?

354
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 "I'm going to tell you what you should think

355
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 "when you see those pretty women.

356
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 "You better think charm is deceitful

357
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 "and beauty is vain,

358
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 "but that a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

359
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 "'Cause, bro, if you go and you chase that little hook

360
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 "and you bite on that and you fall in love

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 "with something that looks a certain way

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 "but doesn't love a certain man,

363
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 "it is going to be the greatest source of pain in your life.

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 "Now, you see that good-looking 50-year-old

365
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 "just a few steps ahead of you?

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 "Go find you one of those that looks just fine

367
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 "but is faithful."

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And so what I'm going to tell you

369
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 is when you find somebody that wants to date you

370
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 because you please them and stimulate them in some way

371
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 and they want you to please them and stimulate them

372
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 for a moment, that is a user.

373
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I told my son, "This is a fact, all right?

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 "You don't choose your friends,

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 "you don't choose your future career,

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 "and you don't choose your future mate

377
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 "by beauty, by money, by position.

378
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 "That's what fools do."

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 You need to know something,

380
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 is that small men use or love things and use people,

381
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 but great men love people

382
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 and are usefully, wisely using things.

383
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Don't you dare love things and use people.

384
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 You don't find your affirmation from a date,

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 you don't find your affirmation from a husband,

386
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 you find your affirmation from the one who says,

387
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 "I am the bread of life and I can satisfy you."

388
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Hey girls, can I just tell you something?

389
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 There is nothing more attractive to a man

390
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 than a woman who is secure.

391
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 There is nothing more attractive to a man

392
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 than a woman who is secure in who God made her.

393
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And I'm going to tell you what,

394
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 man, that shows up for a long time

395
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 in ways in a marriage that you can't even imagine.

396
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 But when we're going to dive in tonight,

397
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 what we're going to do is we're going to study

398
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 what it is that your master,

399
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 as you're on the mission of life,

400
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 says you should, with your mate, pursue.

401
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Seneca, who oddly was born 4 BC,

402
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 about the exact same time as Christ,

403
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 who went on to be an advisor to the emperor in Rome

404
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 who killed disciples of Jesus, Peter and Paul.

405
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Seneca said that unless you know

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 what port you are sailing to,

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 you will not know which wind to catch

408
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 to get you there.

409
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You won't know which way to swipe.

410
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 You won't know which way to go.

411
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 You won't know how to trim your sails

412
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 and what to look for as you navigate your way.

413
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And so what I hope to do tonight

414
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 is to tell you the port that you should sail to.

415
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Are you ready?

416
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Here we go.

417
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 What is the purpose of marriage?

418
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 And if you know the purpose of marriage,

419
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 then you will find somebody who's about these things.

420
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 In Genesis chapter 1,

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 there's this little passage where God said,

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 "Let us make man in our image,

423
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 "according to our likeness."

424
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 This is verse 26.

425
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 He says, "Let them rule over the fish of the sea

426
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 "and over the birds of the sky

427
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 "and over the cattle and over all the earth

428
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 "and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."

429
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And it says, "God created man in his own image.

430
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "In the image of God, he created him.

431
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 "Male and female, he created them."

432
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And when God had done this, he said,

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "We want to make man in our image.

434
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 "What we're going to do is we're going to put men in position

435
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 "where they can be stewards of the earth,

436
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 "they can be vice regents,

437
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 "they can rule over the earth

438
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 "the way we rule over everything."

439
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And what God was doing in Genesis

440
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 is he was unveiling his person,

441
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 he was unveiling his glory,

442
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 he was demonstrating to the angels

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 something that there was no way

444
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 that the angels could ever know

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 without God introducing something

446
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 called humanity into existence.

447
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So I'm going to give you a little insight, okay?

448
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Genesis chapter one is not the beginning of history.

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 It is the beginning of God's engaging humankind in eternity.

450
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 John chapter one, verse one,

451
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 which sounds a lot like Genesis 1-1

452
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 is the beginning of your Bible.

453
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 It goes back to before Genesis 1-1.

454
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It says, "In the beginning was the word,

455
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 "and the word was with God, and the word was God."

456
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 That's where you get the word.

457
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And it says, "In the beginning was the word,

458
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "and the word was with God, and the word was God."

459
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 That's where you get the "us" from in Genesis chapter one.

460
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 There's at least, we know, a couple of them there

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 that are God, that the word was with God

462
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and the word was God,

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 but the word was not the same God that he was with,

464
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 even though they were one.

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 There was diversity,

466
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 but there was still unity,

467
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and there was distinction.

468
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 And what God said is--here's the deal,

469
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 and I'll just give you a little insight.

470
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 If you go to Ezekiel 28 or Isaiah 14,

471
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 you'll catch a little more of this story

472
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 when you have what's called some typology,

473
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 which is just a picture of something unfolding

474
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 in human history, which is a picture

475
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 of something far greater.

476
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 David is a type of Christ. Joseph is a type of Christ.

477
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 The king of Babylon and the king of Tyre

478
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 are types of Satan.

479
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And they are individuals that exalt themselves.

480
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 The story goes basically like this.

481
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 God had created the angelic realm already,

482
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 and in the angelic realm,

483
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 he had created them to enjoy him

484
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 and had given them means to be in his presence.

485
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 But there was one angel in particular

486
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 that based on different, I guess,

487
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 interpretations of the Scripture by scholars,

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 many people believe the chief job of Lucifer

489
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 was to reflect the image and the glory of God.

490
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 In other words, that other angels would look

491
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 at this emerald-gilded angel

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 that had been covered with all the beautiful stones

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 of creation, that the reflection, the beauty,

494
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 and the glory of God would reflect off of him,

495
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 and other angels could almost approach God

496
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 through this angel. And this angel said,

497
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 "They're not approaching God through me.

498
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 "I am better than God. I will exalt myself over God.

499
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 "They won't use me as a way to not be consumed

500
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 "by the glory of God, which if God didn't make

501
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 "provision for them, they would be consumed by him.

502
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 "But they will love and worship me."

503
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And it says he exalted himself,

504
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 and that exalting of himself cost him

505
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 the ability to be in the presence of God.

506
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 That sin cast him out of God's midst.

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 He said, "I will be God."

508
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And God cast him out of his presence.

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 So a third of the angels believed that Lucifer

510
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 was in fact maybe somebody to be followed more than God.

511
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And so what happened the second that that went down

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 is people went, "Well, I'll tell you what.

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 "It's clear now that Jehovah, Yahweh,

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 "carries the biggest stick. You can't jack with him.

515
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 "Satan, in all of his glory and all of his power,

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 "he wasn't as powerful as God. But I wonder this.

517
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 "I wonder if Satan had been given a shot.

518
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 "I wonder if he could rule better than God."

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Enter into that scenario

520
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 that now has God in the heavens

521
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 and Satan in judgment in what would be a place

522
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 that is filled with chaos, darkness,

523
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 void of life and purpose,

524
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 which is what you always find when you leave God.

525
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 A God who steps in and creates beauty and order.

526
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And he places into that place of perfect beauty and order

527
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 people in his image.

528
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And he says, "I want you to know me and walk with me.

529
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 "I want you to enjoy me.

530
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 "I've made this place gorgeous and beautiful,

531
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 "but you need to know something.

532
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 "There's an enemy there, and he wants you to follow him.

533
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 "He wants you to believe that his way is a better way.

534
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 "He's going to tell you what he believes,

535
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 "which is that if you're your own God,

536
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 "it will go better for you."

537
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And that didn't go well for him, and it won't go well for you.

538
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So all you need to know is that I'm good, and trust me.

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 As an eternal sign of your faith in me,

540
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I will put over here a tree of good and evil.

541
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And on that tree, you at any time you want can go eat.

542
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And if you do go eat, you will die,

543
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 because what you're going to say is,

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 "I don't need a relationship with God,

545
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 "and I will be my own God."

546
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 But when you leave the God who is life and light,

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 you will get darkness and death.

548
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That's basically the story that you're entered into

549
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 there in Genesis 1.

550
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Now, who are these people that are introduced?

551
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Because there's a lot of people that speculate about,

552
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 "Well, what is God really like?"

553
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 What we're about to find out is that God is this amazing lover,

554
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 because we already know he's sovereign.

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 He's more powerful than the enemy of darkness.

556
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 The New Testament says that.

557
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 In John chapter 4, verse 4, it says,

558
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 "Greater is he," if you have a relationship with God,

559
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 "who is in you than he," meaning the prince of darkness,

560
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 the prince who is in this world, the spirit of deceit.

561
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 "Greater is he who is in you," Christian,

562
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 "than he who is in the world."

563
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 We know that because God threw Satan out of heaven.

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 We know that because he has conquered sin and death.

565
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We know that because he's defeated the enemy

566
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 and stomped on his head,

567
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 and there will be a day when he will fulfill

568
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 the completion of that defeat.

569
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 But watch this.

570
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 "Meanwhile, I want you to enjoy me."

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And it's going to torment him to see you enjoy me.

572
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He's going to always tell you there's a better way.

573
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 We're going to read that story in just a little bit.

574
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 But what about God?

575
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Who is he?

576
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Men try still to figure this out.

577
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And you know, the word "Trinity" never appears in your Bible,

578
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 but the word that is "Trinity" is described in your Bible.

579
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 It is a label that we have assigned

580
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 to how God has revealed himself.

581
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And there's all kinds of bad analogies

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 that people throw out to try and explain what God is like.

583
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 So they might use this.

584
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 They might use, "Well, God's like water.

585
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 "He's always two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen,

586
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 "but water morphs from a liquid to a solid to a gas

587
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 "depending on the temperature.

588
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 "So it's either liquid water or it's frozen ice or it's steam.

589
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 "It's all water, and God's like that.

590
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 "Sometimes he needs to be fluid,

591
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 "and we need to be able to see him, and that's Jesus.

592
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 "And sometimes we can't see him,

593
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 "and God's at work through his spirit, and that's the gas.

594
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 "And sometimes he's just a solid rock,

595
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 "and that's God the Father, but that is called modalism.

596
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 "It is inconsistent with what the Scriptures teach.

597
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 "It's error."

598
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Other people have used numerous other analogies,

599
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and there is no analogy that really describes

600
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 who God is except one.

601
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And it's the analogy that God gave us

602
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 right here in Genesis 1.

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 It's an analogy that's ultimately fulfilled in marriage.

604
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And we know that the first two people he created,

605
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 male and female, he created them, he brought together,

606
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and he said, "Let them be a picture,

607
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 "as they walk with me, of who we are."

608
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Now, in the Trinity, you have three things

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 that have to be there if you have a biblical view of God.

610
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You have to have unity, that there is only one God.

611
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 The Lord our God is one.

612
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 You have to have diversity, in other words,

613
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 that there is distinct persons,

614
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 because that's what the Bible says.

615
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And you have to have equality,

616
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 which means that they are the same in essence.

617
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 But there is subordination within that relationship.

618
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It's interesting.

619
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 The Son says, "I don't do anything

620
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 "except it's the Father's will."

621
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 The Spirit says, "I exist to exalt Christ."

622
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 The Father says, "Don't worship me.

623
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 "At the name of Jesus, every knee will bow

624
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 "and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."

625
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 There's this mutual admiration society.

626
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Okay, and by the way, it's not a contradiction.

627
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 When you say there is one God who is three persons,

628
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 a contradiction would be if you said

629
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 there is one person who is three persons.

630
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 There's something in the way the Bible reveals

631
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 the character and nature of God that is a mystery.

632
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And the way that we have described it,

633
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 if you have a biblical view of the person of God,

634
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 it is a Trinitarian view.

635
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Now, why do I do all that?

636
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I do all that because the very first thing,

637
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 the only thing that marriage can be

638
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 in a very unique way, that God said,

639
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 "This is the clearest picture I can give you."

640
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It is when there are two persons who watch this,

641
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 not three in one, but two.

642
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 God said, "When you two come together,

643
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 "you're still gonna be unique individual persons,

644
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 "but there's going to be a unity.

645
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 "There's still diversity, but there's equality.

646
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 "Male's not greater than female.

647
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 "Female's not less than male.

648
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "There is equal dignity and beauty."

649
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 They're the same in essence.

650
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Same in value, but they have different roles.

651
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And any organization that exists that is doing well

652
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and is prospering always has people in the organization

653
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 where the members compliment one another

654
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 rather than imitate each other.

655
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It's what makes organizations work.

656
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And so we're gonna compliment each other

657
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 in the way that we work and have along.

658
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And so God made us same in dignity and value,

659
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 just like the Spirit and the Son and the Father

660
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 are same in dignity and value,

661
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 but unique in their purpose and their roles.

662
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The best analogy I have of this,

663
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 I found when I was walking out of a Kroger in 1996.

664
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 It was a Life magazine, and I came across this picture

665
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 of Abigail and Brittany Hensel.

666
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Abigail and Brittany Hensel are the rarest of children.

667
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 They were born co-joined twins.

668
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 The slang term is Siamese twins.

669
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 It's when a single egg, that usually when it separates,

670
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 it becomes identical twins,

671
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 but for some reason their eggs did not completely separate

672
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 in the way that most identical twins' eggs separate.

673
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 But here's the story in Life magazine

674
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 about these two sweet little girls.

675
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And I wanna read it to you

676
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 because it's the best picture I've ever seen

677
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 of exactly what I'm talking about.

678
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Abigail and Brittany, they're co-joined.

679
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 The doctors don't know why they divided.

680
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It says that each one has their own heart and stomach,

681
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 but together they rely on three lungs.

682
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Their spines join at the pelvis.

683
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Below the waist, they have the organs of a single person.

684
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Each controls the limbs and trunk

685
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 and feels sensations on her own side exclusively.

686
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Abby's on the right hand, and Brittany's on the left.

687
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 When they pledge of allegiance here,

688
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Abby will put her hand on Brittany's heart.

689
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 It's interesting, so if you tickle over here,

690
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 it's just Abby that laughs.

691
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 You tickle over here, it's just Brittany that laughs.

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They're very distinct individual persons.

693
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Abby likes animals, Brittany likes to draw.

694
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 One likes crackers in their soup, the other one doesn't.

695
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Their teacher says that they often,

696
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 whenever there's conflict in the class,

697
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 she has Abigail and Brittany give the class

698
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 a lesson on getting along.

699
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 (audience laughing)

700
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It's really interesting, this article in 1996,

701
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 they quote a neurosurgeon from Johns Hopkins

702
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 who was the first person ever to separate co-joined twins.

703
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 His name was Ben Carson.

704
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 And he said, "We've looked at the Hensel girls.

705
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 "We can't separate them because it would be devastating

706
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 "because of the way their organs are put together."

707
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 But I love this.

708
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Their different temperaments have been apparent since infancy.

709
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Abby has a voracious appetite, Brittany finds food boring.

710
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Abby tends to be the leader.

711
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Brittany is more reflective and academically quicker.

712
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Sometimes they argue.

713
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Once, Brittany hit Abby in the head with a rock.

714
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 (audience laughing)

715
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 But they have obvious incentives to arrive at a consensus.

716
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 When they can't agree on where to go, a rare occurrence,

717
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 they literally cannot move.

718
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 When one misbehaves, they're both sent to the room.

719
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 (audience laughing)

720
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I love what Ben Carson said.

721
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 He said, "Listen, neither girl has sufficient body mass

722
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "to support life apart from the other.

723
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 "If we did something to separate them," watch this,

724
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 "it would make them invalids.

725
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 "There would be major emotional and psychological trauma."

726
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 What's that sound like to you?

727
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 You children are divorced.

728
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 You know, one of the oldest illustrations in marriage classes

729
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 that we do sometimes is we take two paper plates

730
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 and we glue them together.

731
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And we let those things really seal together

732
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 the way that they're intended to be to make them stronger.

733
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And then at the end of the class,

734
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 if we're talking about the purpose of marriage

735
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 and what God has joined together, man should separate,

736
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 we say, "Hey, why don't you guys,

737
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 "we're gonna serve you something, I don't know,

738
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 "like baked beans, you know, something you need support."

739
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And say, "But before you do that,

740
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 "why don't you tear your plate apart

741
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 "so you each have a plate?"

742
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And you can imagine what happens to that plate.

743
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 It becomes, both of them are destroyed.

744
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 There is major emotional and physical trauma.

745
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It's not what God intended.

746
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 I love this last thing in this article,

747
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 and I'll just read it to you.

748
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 But you know what's amazing?

749
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 They can ride a bike, they can swim.

750
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 I love this one picture, in fact,

751
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 where they're by the pool.

752
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Let's just put that picture back up there

753
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 because you can see, look at, they're cold

754
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and they're keeping each other warm.

755
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 You can watch that little boy looking at them.

756
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Almost saying, "I wish this guy would, you know,

757
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 "warm me up, maybe," right?

758
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 But it is, I mean, you can't help but look

759
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 at that kind of love.

760
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I mean, it's freaky, isn't it?

761
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 I mean, it's otherworldly when you look at that.

762
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 But listen to this paragraph in Life Magazine.

763
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 "Bound together to each other,

764
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "but defiantly independent."

765
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 These little girls are a living textbook

766
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 on camaraderie and compromise,

767
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 on dignity and flexibility,

768
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 on the subtler varieties of freedom,

769
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 and together, they have volumes to teach us about love.

770
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Can I tell you what should be said

771
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 to Todd Wagner at the 50th wedding anniversary?

772
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 To Alex Wagner?

773
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Todd and Alex Wagner are defiantly independent.

774
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 They've both kept all of their personality,

775
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 all the distinction of what God created them to be,

776
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 but they're a living textbook

777
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 on camaraderie and compromise

778
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 because they don't live

779
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 according to the spirit of Todd

780
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 and the spirit of Alex.

781
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 They live to the spirit of God,

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 where companionship and completion

783
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 and mutual subjection

784
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 and love for one another and exaltation

785
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 is eternally a part of God.

786
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 These are not the highest metaphysical ideas of men.

787
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 These have eternally existed

788
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 in the very nature and character of God.

789
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And God said, "I want you to dwell together."

790
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And what should be said is that Todd and Alex

791
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 have volumes to teach the world about love.

792
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And guess what Todd and Alex should do?

793
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Say, "Hey, listen, we are just a poor shadow

794
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 "of what real love looks like.

795
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 "It's revealed in the Trinity."

796
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And let me tell you about the Trinity.

797
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 The Trinity isn't just a place where you can be alone.

798
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 It's a place where you can be with God.

799
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 The Trinity isn't just love itself,

800
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 because God is love.

801
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 The one thing that love has to do is share itself.

802
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And so God even created, first, the angelic realm

803
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 to share with him his glory and his goodness.

804
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And then he created us to share with us his love.

805
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 But guess what we did?

806
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 We go, "We don't need your love.

807
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 "We think we can get along better without you."

808
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 We see what happens

809
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 when people try and get along without God.

810
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 One of them just walked into a community college

811
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 up in Oregon,

812
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 happily telling you he has no relationship with God

813
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 and that he has listened to the lies of demons

814
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 and now he has become one with them.

815
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Let me tell you,

816
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 that's a rather extravagant example up there.

817
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 But if you date a guy that doesn't have the master

818
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 whose name is Yahweh, Jesus,

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 you're gonna be dating a little boy

820
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 that's gonna storm into your classroom

821
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 and there's gonna be a devastation in your life.

822
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And God loves you enough to say, "You don't need that."

823
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 The very first thing that marriage is supposed to do

824
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 is to mirror the image of God

825
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 in a way that only marriage can.

826
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 And so the way we love each other

827
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 in mutual subjection,

828
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 in completeness and care and love,

829
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 is mirrored.

830
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 The second thing marriage does

831
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 is to multiply godly heritage.

832
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 It says in Genesis 1, verse 28,

833
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 "God blessed them and God said to them,

834
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 "'Be fruitful and multiply.'"

835
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Now what's that mean?

836
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 He says, "Listen, I want you to bring forth,"

837
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 in Genesis chapter one,

838
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 a significant event haven't happened yet,

839
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 but a significant event was

840
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 that men had rebelled against God.

841
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so in Genesis chapter one, verse 28,

842
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 when God blessed them and said, "Multiply,"

843
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 the law of creation is that creatures

844
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 would bring forth things after their kind.

845
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And so hippos would bring forth hippos,

846
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 giraffes would bring forth giraffes,

847
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 and humans who knew God and walked with God

848
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 would bring forth humans who knew God and walked with God.

849
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 That was God's intention.

850
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 He said, "Fill the earth with people

851
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 "who know me and delight in me."

852
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 In Genesis chapter one, verse 24,

853
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 this is where the law of creation shows up.

854
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures

855
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 "after their kind, cattle and creeping things

856
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 "and the beasts of the earth after their kind."

857
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And it was so.

858
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 God makes the beasts of the earth after their kind

859
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 and the cattle after their kind

860
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind.

861
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And God saw that it was good.

862
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And guess what?

863
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 If you've got people who know that God is good,

864
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 who love his mission and who live his way,

865
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 and we multiply those people, it will be good.

866
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 One of the reasons you love coming to the porch

867
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 is even people that live insane lives,

868
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 when they come here, there's a spirit of kindness

869
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 and hospitality and other-centeredness in this place.

870
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Isn't there?

871
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 There's a spirit of excellence and creativity in this place.

872
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 There's a spirit of peace in this place,

873
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 and it's incredibly attractive.

874
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And you do everything you can to tell your friends to come.

875
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And guess what you're doing?

876
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 You're trying to invite people into a small sampling

877
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 of what the kingdom should be like.

878
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 That's God's view of the church.

879
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Okay?

880
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 That's God's view of a Christian marriage.

881
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 That people will say, "You know what?

882
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 "I've had friends of my kids say,

883
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 "'Hey, we want to go hang out at your house.

884
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 "'We'd love being with your family.

885
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 "'Our family's not like that.'"

886
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 You know what's really interesting?

887
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Just to give you a little example of what happens

888
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 when the family breaks down

889
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 and the emotional and physical instability

890
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 that can invade into a home.

891
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 It's really interesting.

892
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I've seen it in Fox News,

893
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 and even the father of that murderer up there in Oregon.

894
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 They all count how many guns that kid had in his home,

895
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 but they didn't count how many parents he had.

896
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 That kid's problem wasn't that he had guns in his home.

897
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 That kid's problem is he didn't have parents in his home

898
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 that multiplied the kindness and goodness and love of God.

899
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 (congregation laughing)

900
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 And so he's saying, "Hey, listen, man.

901
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 "You multiply a godly heritage.

902
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 "You be about making disciples."

903
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Thirdly, in Genesis chapter one, verse 28,

904
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 the second part of that verse says,

905
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 "Fill the earth, subdue it.

906
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 "Rule over the fish of the sea

907
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 "and over the birds of the sky

908
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 "and over every living thing that moves on the earth.

909
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 "I want you to manage your world."

910
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 There it is.

911
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 So mirror a love relationship

912
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 where you've got distinct individuals who are unified,

913
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 who are equal, and yet who operate with very clear roles.

914
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Multiply that love of goodness and excellence

915
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 and godliness and self-discipline and perseverance.

916
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Multiply that out in them.

917
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Multiply other-centeredness and selflessness.

918
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Do all you can to multiply in them an affection

919
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 for the God that allows you to walk that way.

920
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And then make sure that this world that you're in

921
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 doesn't tell you how to roll.

922
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 You manage your world.

923
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Don't let your world manage you.

924
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Now watch this.

925
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 I'm gonna show you something very interesting here

926
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 because Satan, in John chapter eight, verse 44,

927
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 says he's a liar.

928
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 That's all he does.

929
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 He's not creative.

930
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 He's just a liar.

931
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 If God said that marriage is a gift

932
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 and that sex in marriage

933
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 is where sex should be celebrated and enjoyed,

934
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 all the enemy does, he goes,

935
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 "Why wait for marriage to have sex?

936
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 "Marital sex is nothing like premarital sex."

937
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And in that sense, he's right

938
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 because marriage sex isn't defined by guilt and shame

939
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 and horror if it produces children.

940
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 It's not riddled with disease

941
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 because of what happens

942
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 when humans pass themselves around to one another.

943
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 But he doesn't sell it that way, does he?

944
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 He's just a liar.

945
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 So watch what happens.

946
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 This is Genesis chapter one, okay?

947
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 And so in Genesis chapter one,

948
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 you've got God.

949
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And God is basically creating and telling humans,

950
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 which he creates, if we get to chapter two,

951
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 in the form of male and female

952
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 that are both made in his image,

953
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 that they should relate to each other this way

954
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 and serve him and honor him.

955
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 And they're to rule over the world.

956
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And specifically, he gives Adam the right

957
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 to name the animals

958
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 and to have dominion over them.

959
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Now, when you get to Genesis three,

960
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 you guys know the story.

961
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Let's just read it together.

962
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Genesis chapter three, it says,

963
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 "Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field

964
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 "which the Lord God had made.

965
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 "He said to the woman,

966
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 "'Hey, has God said you shall not eat

967
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 "'from the tree of the garden?'

968
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 "The woman said to the serpent,

969
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 "'From the fruit of the trees of the garden we can eat.'

970
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 "But, excuse me, yeah.

971
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 "'From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,

972
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 "'but from the fruit of the tree

973
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 "'which is in the middle of the garden,

974
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 "'God said you shall not eat from it

975
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 "'or touch it or you will die.'"

976
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Now listen, that's not what God said.

977
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Adam apparently was a lazy teacher.

978
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 God didn't say you can't touch it or you will die.

979
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 He just probably went in his lack of care.

980
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 In Genesis two, we know that God told the man,

981
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 "Hey, you can do whatever you want,

982
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 "just don't eat of that tree."

983
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Okay, and so I can imagine when he's discipling Eve,

984
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 he adds to the word of God,

985
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and so whenever you add to the word of God,

986
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 it sets people up for confusion.

987
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 He said, "Look, just don't even go near that tree.

988
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 "Don't even touch that tree.

989
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 "If you touch it, you're gonna die."

990
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 That's me reading into the text,

991
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 but the reason I think that I can do that

992
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 with some confidence is Eve apparently was told,

993
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 "We can't touch it or die.

994
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 "Here's an opportunity.

995
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 "There's a high reverence for the word of God,

996
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 "but a misunderstanding of the word of God

997
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 "and not an ability to divide it rightly."

998
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And so he goes, "That's not true.

999
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 "Look, I'm touching it.

1000
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 "I'm not dead."

1001
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Let me just tell you something.

1002
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 It's a very dangerous thing when you venerate

1003
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 and honor the word of God and you are ignorant of it.

1004
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 You are set up to really, really be deceived.

1005
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 But anyway, we got the serpent talking to the woman

1006
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 and she sees that the tree is pleasing to the eyes.

1007
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 It's a delight to her flesh and it's desirous

1008
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 because of what it promises her,

1009
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 the ability to be able to be independent and free,

1010
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 even though God said you can't be independent

1011
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 of your life support.

1012
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And by the way, when you know knowledge like I know knowledge,

1013
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 I'm not afraid that you're gonna beat me at Jeopardy.

1014
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 That's not why I don't want you to eat at that tree.

1015
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 The problem is is you're not intrinsically good like me.

1016
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And isn't this the case?

1017
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Listen, gang, don't most of you know

1018
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 the kind of guy you should date?

1019
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Don't most of you know the things

1020
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 that lead to guilt and shame in your life?

1021
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Don't we all know that?

1022
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 And yet how many of us continue to do things

1023
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 that are destructive to our hearts

1024
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 and it's not a knowledge problem.

1025
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 We just keep going back.

1026
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 And so listen, God said I don't want you to go there.

1027
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 Just keep looking to me.

1028
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Because if you look to yourself,

1029
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 you're gonna rationalize and compromise and twist

1030
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 and you're gonna do what you know you shouldn't do

1031
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 and convince yourself somehow it's gonna be okay.

1032
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And it's not okay, it's killing you.

1033
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 This is Genesis three.

1034
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 We've got the serpent.

1035
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 The serpent talking to humanity

1036
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 telling the woman who took the apple that she ate

1037
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 and gave it to the man who was with her

1038
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 so that now they would know good and evil

1039
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 and they could tell God what to do.

1040
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Anybody notice anything here?

1041
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 That's just a complete inversion

1042
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 of what's supposed to happen.

1043
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 Now for the sake of time,

1044
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 I'll just tell you what happens here

1045
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 is God comes right back in in Genesis three

1046
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 and says hey that ain't the way we're gonna roll.

1047
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 And so God says here's the deal.

1048
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 I am God and I'm still gonna be over you humans

1049
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 and you humans are gonna still be together

1050
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 and you're still gonna be in the world

1051
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 but guess what?

1052
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Now there is enmity between us

1053
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 and there's gonna be because we don't know each other,

1054
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 there's enmity between you two

1055
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 and there's gonna be a curse on the world

1056
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 and that my friends is the world that we're in.

1057
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 It's not the world that God created,

1058
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 it's the world that we chose.

1059
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 But stay tuned

1060
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 because I told you the reason that God created us

1061
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 is because he was gonna show you something about himself

1062
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 and the story gets beautiful in just a moment.

1063
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 So here's what happens in this little section right here

1064
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 is that God says I want you to manage the world.

1065
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Don't let your world manage you.

1066
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 When you get out of whack with the way the world should go,

1067
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 it's not gonna go well with you.

1068
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 You are supposed to be in the world but not of it.

1069
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Let the word show you how to live in the world.

1070
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 We're to mirror his image in marriage.

1071
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 We're to multiply a godly heritage

1072
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 and together with all the beauty that is womanhood

1073
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 and with all the beauty that is maleness,

1074
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 we are to manage the world

1075
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 and there's very specific ways that we're to do that together

1076
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 and we'll get to that in just a moment.

1077
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 But now the fourth thing that we are is

1078
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 we're people that should mutually complete one another.

1079
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 This is interesting because JP last week said

1080
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 you gotta lose that lie.

1081
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 I even talked about it at the beginning

1082
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 that there's this person out there that can complete you

1083
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 like will you complete me?

1084
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 And it is true.

1085
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 There's nobody out there that's gonna complete you

1086
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 in the sense that they make you whole

1087
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 but let me just tell you

1088
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 it is a biblical fact that women are to help men

1089
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 be everything that a man should be

1090
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 in the context of marriage

1091
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 in the same way that Shane and I as we do life together

1092
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 are to spur each other on to love and good deeds

1093
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 that JP and I complete each other.

1094
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Let me just give it to you this way.

1095
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 We are to be vessels through which God could minister and work.

1096
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 In Philippians chapter one verse six it says

1097
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 that he who began this good work in you

1098
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 will bring it about to completion

1099
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 in the day of Christ Jesus.

1100
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 Colossians chapter one verse 28 says

1101
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 we proclaim him admonishing every man

1102
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 and teaching every man

1103
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 in order that we might present every man

1104
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 complete in Christ.

1105
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 And so I wanna show you what God intended

1106
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 us to do with one another.

1107
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 It's God's intention.

1108
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Actually I don't need to do that

1109
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 because I think we've got it for you up here.

1110
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 God intended for men to dwell with women

1111
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 to care for her, to love her.

1112
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 It's our job to stay there

1113
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 and to say I'm going to bring forth all your beauty.

1114
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 I'm gonna show you all your worth

1115
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 that I can as a vessel of God.

1116
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 You've already got that worth in Jesus.

1117
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 I'm going to be a visible, physical gift to you

1118
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 as a constant expression of God's love for you.

1119
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 I'm gonna care for you and protect you

1120
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 and provide for you and encourage you.

1121
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 I'm gonna cherish you and honor you.

1122
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 I'm gonna cultivate the relationship.

1123
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 I'm gonna spur you on in every way

1124
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 that a person who's close to you should.

1125
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 What most men do however is they get there

1126
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 and the woman is not easy ground.

1127
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 It's not low hanging fruit.

1128
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Instead of cherishing and nourishing and honoring her,

1129
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 they start to intimidate her and say

1130
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 if you don't start producing,

1131
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 if you don't start growing what I want grown,

1132
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 if you don't start giving me what I want,

1133
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 I'm gonna have a scorched earth policy here.

1134
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 They become abusive and they become domineering.

1135
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 That's a sin expression.

1136
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Or what they do is they become very passive

1137
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 and they just withdraw from the house.

1138
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 They leave.

1139
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 Or they're present and they're just not there.

1140
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 They may not divorce,

1141
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 but they're really just undivorced

1142
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 more than they are married.

1143
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 They don't pursue oneness.

1144
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Likewise, women are called to complete.

1145
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 In Genesis 2.18, it's where I get this idea from.

1146
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 It says the Lord God said it's not good for man to be alone.

1147
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 I will make him a helper suitable for him.

1148
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 And so God gives us one another

1149
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 in relationships in general,

1150
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 and specifically there might be a day

1151
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 where somebody covenants with you

1152
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 and if you marry you have not sinned

1153
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 and a woman's role is to complete.

1154
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 And what that means is not the Jerry Maguire,

1155
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 you complete me,

1156
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 but notice this,

1157
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 it's the woman that's completing the man.

1158
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 Meaning, Alex, I'm not home yet.

1159
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 I'm not all that God wants me to be.

1160
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 Speak into my life.

1161
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Admonish me when I'm unruly.

1162
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 Encourage me when I'm faint hearted.

1163
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 Help me when I'm weak.

1164
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Be patient with me.

1165
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 My wife knows that I wanna be God's man.

1166
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 My wife and I spent a good two hours yesterday

1167
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 dealing with an area of my life

1168
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 that she believed I could improve in.

1169
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Yesterday I was speaking to our residents

1170
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 here at Watermark and they said,

1171
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 "Hey Todd, what's the best thing that your wife does

1172
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 "to help you lead this church?"

1173
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 And I said, "That's easy.

1174
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 "She speaks faithfully to me.

1175
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 "She knows who I want to be

1176
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 "and when she sees me deviate from that,

1177
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 "she gently, first looking to herself,

1178
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 "let she too be tempted,

1179
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 "in a spirit of gentleness,

1180
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 "she comes to me and says,

1181
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 "Hey, this is something that I know you care about.

1182
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 "It might be the way I'm making her feel.

1183
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 "It might be the way that I'm filling up my days.

1184
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 "It might be the way that I'm not self-aware with tone.

1185
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 "It might be that she sees that my habits

1186
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 "or practices are not excellent

1187
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 "and she says, 'I wanna help you be the man

1188
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 "'that I believe you are.'"

1189
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 But what some women do is they don't sit there

1190
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 and complete a guy.

1191
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 What they'll do is they'll compete for headship.

1192
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 They'll go, "I don't like the way you're leading,

1193
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 "so I will just take you on.

1194
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 "And this will be a matriarchal at home

1195
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 "and I'm gonna run this ship

1196
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 "the way I wanna run this ship."

1197
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Or they will just back off

1198
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 and they'll have a false view

1199
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 of what it means to be a submissive wife

1200
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 and so they'll just condone sinless behavior,

1201
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 usually for about 20 years until the kids are gone

1202
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 and then they have an affair with their trainer.

1203
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 And I'm just telling you,

1204
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 that is not what God had in mind.

1205
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 When he calls us to mutually complete one another.

1206
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Fifthly, this is a picture that JP alluded to

1207
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 a little bit last week,

1208
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 so I won't spend much time on it,

1209
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 but I'll give you one particular little bit of truth in this

1210
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 and that is that God wants us

1211
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 to model something for the world

1212
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 that makes the world marvel

1213
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 in the same way that Brittany and Abby did that.

1214
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 He wants us to model something for the world.

1215
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 What is it?

1216
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 It's an incredible picture of love.

1217
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of encouragement.

1218
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 This is the role of a man.

1219
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 The Bible says that a man should love the woman

1220
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 as Christ loved the church.

1221
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 You might ask yourself,

1222
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 "Well, Todd, how's Christ love the church?"

1223
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Well, let me just give you a list.

1224
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 It looks something like this.

1225
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 The way that men are supposed to love women,

1226
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 the way that Christ loves the church,

1227
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 is unconditionally, constantly,

1228
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 completely, sacrificially, selflessly,

1229
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 even to the point of death,

1230
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 endlessly, eternally, always initiating,

1231
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 not waiting to be initiated with.

1232
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Do it with great patience and tenderness,

1233
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 unshakably, and do all that perfectly.

1234
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 How's that for a job description?

1235
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 That's what men are called to do,

1236
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 is to model what a love looks like

1237
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 that loves like that in marriage.

1238
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Now, by the way, here we go.

1239
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
 We come back and say, "Okay, well, what's a woman to do?"

1240
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 A woman to a man that is to love this way

1241
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 is to be somebody that is to respond to that leadership

1242
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 and to be subject to that man.

1243
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 This is so important.

1244
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 Girls, please listen to me on this.

1245
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 Women are not to be subject to men.

1246
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 Nowhere in the Bible does it say

1247
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 that women are to be subject to men.

1248
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 It says, "Wives,

1249
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 "be subject to your husbands."

1250
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 What kind of husbands?

1251
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 Husbands that are subject to Christ.

1252
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 Women, if you choose to yoke yourself to a guy

1253
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 who's gonna physically be stronger than you,

1254
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 emotionally fight differently than you,

1255
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 and he is not subject to a sovereign God

1256
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 who does nothing from self-mission of empty conceit

1257
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 and who has in himself the same attitude

1258
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 which was in Christ Jesus,

1259
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 you are walking into hell.

1260
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 And so Jesus tells you this.

1261
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 He says, "Make sure you marry this kind of guy."

1262
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 Wives, be subject to this kind of man,

1263
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 a spirit-filled man.

1264
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 Don't even date a guy that's not spirit-filled.

1265
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 Your master who loves you,

1266
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 who wants it to go well with you,

1267
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 say, "Don't yoke with that guy.

1268
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 "Just don't date that guy.

1269
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 "Don't even go there.

1270
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 "Don't be confused by his charm or his abs

1271
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
 "or his car or his career.

1272
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 "Only be attracted to a man that's in love with me

1273
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 "or it will cost you

1274
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 "because you are walking into a dictatorship

1275
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 "that you will regret the rest of your life.

1276
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 "And don't blame me.

1277
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 "All I did was warn you."

1278
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 Look, here's what a woman does.

1279
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 A woman is to respond to the man,

1280
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 to be respectful towards the man,

1281
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
 to be obedient to his godly, selfless leadership,

1282
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 to submit to that,

1283
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 to be humble, adoring, and full of devotion.

1284
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 Now let me ask you a question.

1285
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 Girls, have a little empathy for us.

1286
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 Look at those two job descriptions.

1287
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 Which one of those two is the hardest?

1288
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Can I tell you which one it is, men?

1289
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 It's the gals.

1290
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 And let me just tell you, men,

1291
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 this is why the Bible says,

1292
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 "Hey, man, you don't love your wife

1293
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
 "the way I want to love your wife,

1294
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 "then you're gonna find out what it's like

1295
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 "to be led by a god like that."

1296
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 Men, it says,

1297
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 "If you feel like you're not getting through to me,

1298
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 "then the first place you oughta look

1299
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 "is how you're treating your wife."

1300
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 This is 1 Peter chapter three.

1301
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
 "Your prayers are hindered."

1302
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 They're hitting the ceiling.

1303
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 They're not going anywhere

1304
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 because why would a god who is sovereign

1305
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 and loving towards you answer your prayers

1306
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
 while you're being abusive and cruel to others?

1307
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 You better repent of that and deal with that,

1308
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 and then you and I can do business together again.

1309
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 Here's how I know, by the way,

1310
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 that this is much harder to be the woman than the man

1311
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 because I am the woman in this analogy,

1312
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 meaning I'm a part of the church.

1313
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 Jesus is my bridegroom.

1314
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Let me ask you guys a question.

1315
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 Has Jesus loved me unconditionally?

1316
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 Say yes.

1317
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 Does he love me constantly?

1318
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 Does he never leave me and forsake me?

1319
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 Is it complete?

1320
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 Is it sacrificial?

1321
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 Is it selfless?

1322
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
 Is it the point of death?

1323
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 Is it endless, initiating with great patience,

1324
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 tender, unshakable, and perfectly?

1325
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
 Say yes.

1326
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 So let me ask you a question.

1327
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 How do you think I do?

1328
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 I've got a perfect husband.

1329
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 How do you think I do in responding to him?

1330
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 Am I always respectful?

1331
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Am I perfectly obedient?

1332
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 Do I always submit to Jesus Christ?

1333
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 Am I humble, enduring, am I fully devoted?

1334
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Not all the time.

1335
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Guys, can you imagine how hard it would be

1336
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 to serve a God who was moody and self-serving

1337
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
 and abusive and who sometimes was domineering

1338
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 or just deserted you 'cause he was wanting

1339
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 to get his something somewhere else,

1340
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 and that was still your job?

1341
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 There's never been a guy that's fulfilled

1342
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
 that job description perfectly,

1343
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 and yet, women, that's what you're called to do.

1344
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 That's why you need to complete him and spur him on.

1345
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 And by the way, that's why you need to make sure

1346
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
 that you marry a guy who's radically in love with Jesus.

1347
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 Because when my wife comes to me and says,

1348
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
 "Todd, I see some things that are out of sync

1349
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 "with your life with Jesus," I am all ears.

1350
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
 I'm like, "That's all I wanna be is in love with Jesus.

1351
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 "That's all I wanna do is respond

1352
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 "to the God who cares for me."

1353
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 And by the way, as we,

1354
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 as we show you this beautiful thing,

1355
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
 do you notice what God did right here?

1356
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 This is Genesis 3.

1357
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 This is the second part of Genesis 3,

1358
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 but there's something amazing that happens here.

1359
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
 We're gonna draw this back up one more time.

1360
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 There's an event that happens right here,

1361
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 and it's called the cross.

1362
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 And at this event that's called the cross,

1363
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
 in Ephesians chapters one,

1364
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
 two, and three, the cross is introduced.

1365
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 It's what Jesus has done.

1366
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
 And what Jesus has done is he's taken away

1367
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 the enmity between God and humanity.

1368
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
 And now there is peace between the church

1369
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 and God's people, and so man is renewed.

1370
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 And God uses Genesis 2 language in Ephesians 5.

1371
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 Genesis 2 is before Genesis 3.

1372
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
 He says, "You men can now love your wife this way.

1373
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
 "You can leave and cleave and become one flesh."

1374
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 Why, because you're no longer sinners.

1375
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
 We're gonna hurt each other.

1376
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 And so male and female who both love me

1377
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
 because they have a relationship with me,

1378
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 there can be peace in the home again.

1379
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
 That's why in Ephesians 4, it says,

1380
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
 "I urge you, therefore, in light of these things,

1381
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 "to walk worthy of the calling with which you've been called,

1382
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
 "with all humility and gentleness and sure forbearance,

1383
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
 "and show patience to one another in love.

1384
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 "Be diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit

1385
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
 "that's been accomplished."

1386
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
 But guess what?

1387
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
 Ephesians 5 talks about how there's a renewed peace

1388
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 in Christian marriage,

1389
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
 but there's still a war in there

1390
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
 between you and the world.

1391
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
 That's why Ephesians 6 talks about spiritual warfare.

1392
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
 And it says, "If you want this thing to work,

1393
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
 "you need to know that same enemy that tried to screw you up

1394
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 "in Genesis 3 is trying to screw you up right now.

1395
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
 "And if you don't stay close to God,

1396
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
 "he's gonna take you out.

1397
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
 "And so your fight is not against flesh and blood.

1398
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
 "Your problem is never your spouse.

1399
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
 "Your spouse is not your enemy. Satan is."

1400
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
 I was showing this to a couple that I was gonna marry,

1401
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
 and the bride goes, "Well, what am I doing

1402
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
 "getting dressed in white?"

1403
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 And she looked at her husband, and she said,

1404
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
 "We're getting married in camo, 'cause we're going to war."

1405
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
 (audience laughing)

1406
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
 And I said, "That would be the most theologically correct

1407
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 "thing a bride had ever done.

1408
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
 "And I'd love to do the wedding. It'd be awesome.

1409
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
 "That would be amazing, right?

1410
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
 "Unless you're in Alabama, and then it's amazing

1411
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
 "if you wear white, okay?

1412
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
 "They all wear camo at weddings in Alabama.

1413
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 "All right, no, now listen."

1414
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
 I close with this.

1415
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
 Let me ask you guys a question.

1416
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
 If marriage is God's way to mirror his person,

1417
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
 to multiply kindness and goodness and love in the world,

1418
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 to manage the world so that grace may increase,

1419
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
 to mutually complete his most cherished creation,

1420
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
 and to model a picture of God's love for the world,

1421
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 how much do you think the enemy hates it?

1422
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
 Oh, I think he hates it a lot.

1423
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
 And that's why if you purpose to have a godly Christian marriage,

1424
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
 you need to know you're at war.

1425
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
 And let me just tell you this.

1426
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
 Not only are you at war, but what he's trying to do

1427
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
 is disqualify you before you ever get in the battle.

1428
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
 Let me tell you what singleness is.

1429
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
 Are you ready?

1430
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
 This is the best picture I can give you of singleness.

1431
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
 It's seal training.

1432
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
 And what you need to be doing right now,

1433
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
 this is a big deal, okay?

1434
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
 The seals have a model, and that is that one is none

1435
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 and two is one.

1436
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
 What's that sound like?

1437
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
 It sounds very Genesis 2 to me,

1438
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
 that the two shall become one.

1439
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
 The seals say, "We can't go at this thing alone.

1440
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
 "We need each other.

1441
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
 "We're not gonna do well."

1442
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
 Guess what they try and do during seal training?

1443
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
 They try and wash people out.

1444
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 They don't make any excuses, because if you're not a warrior,

1445
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
 it's one thing if you go to war and you're just not responsible

1446
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
 and you get picked off by the enemy and you die,

1447
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
 but when you're on a seal mission,

1448
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
 when you're out there trying to do this special ops,

1449
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
 this thing that you better be ready,

1450
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
 if one of the guys on the team can't do his job,

1451
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
 then they both die.

1452
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
 And so you gotta quit nursing somebody along

1453
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
 in the seal training that is singleness and in dating

1454
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
 that you're gonna yoke with and you're gonna go to war

1455
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
 and it's gonna clean your clock,

1456
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
 because any relationship is only as healthy

1457
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
 as the least healthy person in it.

1458
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
 And so what you wanna do is what the military does,

1459
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
 and before you even get to seal training,

1460
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
 you watch them in other branches of the service.

1461
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
 You watch how they do in their basic in-doc,

1462
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
 and then they eventually apply and qualify,

1463
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
 and then they date them in absolute focused merging.

1464
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
 And then, with experienced commanders around them

1465
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
 who have counseled them and told them what war is like

1466
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 and what war is about, others say,

1467
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
 "We think you guys are ready to be a team."

1468
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
 Now you can form your own little seal team,

1469
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
 your own little way, but you're not gonna be seals.

1470
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
 And if you wanna be effective in marriage,

1471
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 you better go to war right now and show yourself

1472
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
 to be a warrior so that other people are going,

1473
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
 "You know what you are? You're fit to go to training.

1474
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
 "You're fit right now to enter into a relationship

1475
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 "with somebody else, 'cause I see in you

1476
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
 "a love for the image of God.

1477
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
 "I see in you a commitment to multiply

1478
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
 "everybody that God brings into relationship with you.

1479
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
 "I see you making disciples."

1480
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
 So if someday God gave you one from the womb,

1481
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
 you might be a good partner.

1482
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 "I see you managing your world and not letting your world--

1483
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
 "I see you in friendships with others,

1484
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
 "in biblical community, where you don't run away

1485
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
 "when it gets hard, but you dwell.

1486
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
 "You complete other women.

1487
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
 "You are a godly sharpener of people made in God's image.

1488
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
 "And I see you modeling a right response to love.

1489
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
 "I see you loving people unconditionally.

1490
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
 "That's who you ought to date.

1491
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
 "That's who you enter into."

1492
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
 You guys have heard that there is

1493
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
 a rampant epidemic of divorce.

1494
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
 It's true that 50% of people, Christian and non-Christian,

1495
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
 by profession, are divorcing.

1496
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
 This stat is true.

1497
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
 But let me just show you something.

1498
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
 If you're a non-Christian and you don't go to church,

1499
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
 you are less likely to divorce

1500
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
 than if you're just a porchie or a watermarker,

1501
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 where you just go to church,

1502
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
 but you don't let Jesus run through you.

1503
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 It is a fact that you are 20% more likely to divorce

1504
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
 if you marry somebody just 'cause they dress up

1505
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 and play army, because they go to the porch,

1506
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 'cause they carry a Bible, but they are not

1507
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
 in love with the person of God.

1508
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
 They are not making disciples.

1509
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
 They are not managing their world.

1510
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 They're drifting along with the current of Dallas,

1511
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 and they just happen to go to the porch on Tuesday nights.

1512
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
 They're not living in biblical community.

1513
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 They don't let anybody dwell in their life.

1514
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
 They don't let anybody complete them,

1515
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
 and they're not completing anybody else.

1516
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
 And they don't respond to their bridegroom, Jesus Christ.

1517
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 They're not somebody who's already well married

1518
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
 to an unconditional, sacrificial, perfect lover.

1519
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
 But they say they know him.

1520
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
 You marry that person, you are 20% more likely

1521
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 to be a statistic.

1522
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
 But here's the great news.

1523
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
 You find somebody who's committed to Jesus,

1524
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
 who really loves him, who's in biblical community,

1525
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
 who dwells with others, who makes disciples,

1526
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
 and is a disciple himself, who responds fully

1527
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
 to Jesus Christ, this is a fact.

1528
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
 This is a sociological fact.

1529
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
 You are 35% more likely to have a successful marriage.

1530
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
 In other words, find people that are warriors,

1531
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
 and that other shepherds are around them

1532
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
 saying this guy's ready to go.

1533
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
 This person's ready to take on the enemy,

1534
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
 camouflaged as a normal person when they are supernatural

1535
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
 because of the reuniting of their life with Jesus

1536
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
 through the miracle of the cross.

1537
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
 Father, I pray for my friends

1538
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
 that understanding tonight what marriage is about,

1539
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
 understanding how the decisions that they make

1540
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 are gonna influence their ability to find joy

1541
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 or pain in marriage, that they would be individuals

1542
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
 that would say, okay, first of all, I gotta go to war.

1543
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
 I gotta become your man or your woman.

1544
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
 I've gotta be an individual that takes some serious stock

1545
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 and says, do I know you as master,

1546
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
 and am I already on mission for you?

1547
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
 So am I trying to represent you to a world

1548
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 and be the godly man or woman that you want me to be

1549
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
 where I am making disciples and being discipled

1550
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
 and ruling my world and being in the world

1551
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
 but not of it, being in community,

1552
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
 being well married to Jesus,

1553
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 where I've left every relationship or activity

1554
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
 in order that I might become closer to him

1555
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
 and that I evaluate every new opportunity

1556
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
 by asking myself, will it draw me closer to Jesus

1557
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
 or pull me apart so that I might be one with Christ,

1558
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
 well married to him?

1559
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
 Lord, I pray that people who are doing those things

1560
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
 would find each other if they desired to get married,

1561
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
 and they would not fall in love with beauty.

1562
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
 They wouldn't use people and love things,

1563
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
 but Lord, that you would make us like Christ,

1564
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
 that we would love people,

1565
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
 and we would use dating to evaluate

1566
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
 whether we should go to war together,

1567
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
 knowing already what our mission is,

1568
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
 and we'd use marriage to glorify you.

1569
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
 Would you protect your people by laying out your map

1570
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,080
 for life as you intended it, in Jesus' name, amen.
