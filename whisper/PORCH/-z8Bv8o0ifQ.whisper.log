[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:24.840]   Spiritual war, words and wonders.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420]   Man, the unseen.
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.120]   Hello porch, how you doing man?
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.120]   It is awesome to be with you.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.080]   I wanted to jump in on this series
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.240]   because I love you guys.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.200]   And because this truth that we're talking about right here
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.560]   is gonna make the difference between death and life for you.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.520]   And it's also one of the areas that is most misunderstood,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.600]   which doesn't surprise me.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.620]   If we've got an enemy and he is at war with us,
[00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.780]   one of the greatest things that he can do
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.340]   is to convince you that he's something that he's not
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.740]   or that he attacks you in ways that he doesn't.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.880]   Because if you believe he's something that he's not,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.680]   man, it's hard to resist what you believe doesn't exist.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.840]   And it's also hard to fight against an enemy
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.560]   when you think the enemy's fighting this way
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.920]   when he's really fighting that way.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.200]   And I'm telling you something, there is a fight
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.840]   and you are to be of sober spirit,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.560]   which means don't be drunk on bad theology,
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.800]   on bad teaching, on imaginary ideas.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.000]   Means you be sober, you be clear thinking.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.720]   You be on the alert 'cause you have an adversary, the devil.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.760]   Do you guys know this?
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   60% of Christians don't believe in the devil.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.240]   They think of him as some kind of just idea
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.840]   or some abstract representation.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960]   In fact, what's so even crazier
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.920]   is almost that many believers think
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.600]   that the Holy Spirit is not a person, it's an it.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.300]   They're more informed by Star Wars theology,
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.200]   this impersonal force that you activate
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.240]   more than understand that God is a living being.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880]   And when you don't understand the power of God
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.320]   and you don't understand the threat of your enemy,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.800]   man, you are cooked and you're gonna start to look like
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.040]   the way people stereotypically say your generation looks.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.840]   And I love you guys.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.440]   And truth sets you free.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.680]   There's an enemy, he's come to steal, kill, and destroy.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.200]   He is stealing your future.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.440]   He is killing your hope.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.600]   He is destroying your self-respect.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.160]   He's destroying your relationships.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   He's destroying family before your eyes.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.160]   Over 50% of all children born to your generation
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.800]   are born into single-family households.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.640]   Why?
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   Because you bought a lie.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.980]   And I love you guys,
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.040]   and we're gonna give you some truth, all right?
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.320]   And it's gonna set you free.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.240]   Man, truth is always compassionate when you share it
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.520]   'cause it sets people free.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.400]   But truth sounds like hate to those who hate the truth.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.520]   Right?
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.280]   And so when you speak the truth, you do it in love
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.720]   because truth said in hate won't be heard.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.800]   But love without truth is not love, folks.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.600]   And your generation has too few truth tellers in it,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   which is why I love the porch
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.340]   'cause you guys get some truth here, amen?
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.180]   There's some truth.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.000]   Now listen, you might be there like,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.440]   okay, well, let's just hear what kind of truth you got.
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.880]   Let me give you some truth, okay?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.080]   One of the things that I loved to do when I was a kid
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.500]   is we would share ghost stories, right?
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.280]   'Cause I kind of love the feeling of being scared.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.180]   When I was a kid, I didn't know any better, right?
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660]   And so I love getting scared.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.400]   And we would tell stories, and we would get freaked out,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.040]   and we would go see movies.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.280]   I mean, back then, "The Night of the Living Dead,"
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.400]   the very first zombie movie,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.880]   it was first a black and white film.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.000]   I can remember watching that at a drive-in
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.960]   before I hit puberty, and it freaked me out, man.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.220]   That's all I can tell you.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.400]   And it should have because you're not supposed to sit there
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.400]   and have your mind meditate on that kind of craziness
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   and that kind of evil.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.360]   But if you think about classic horror films,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   if you think about the movie that set it all on fire,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.080]   that really got it all going on,
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.760]   it was a movie that starred this guy right there.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.000]   Frankenstein.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.760]   That's what got it all going.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.600]   Now listen, here's the deal.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.640]   You guys know this, not because you're scholars,
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.240]   not because you did your homework when you were
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.080]   in high school, but because there's a movie
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.120]   that come out recently, and you probably know
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.360]   who wrote Frankenstein, right?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.280]   Because you now know that there's Bram Stoker's "Dracula,"
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   and there is Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," right?
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.560]   'Cause you read the Spark Notes to a book, right?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.400]   Remember?
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.120]   Yeah, you did.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.880]   So let me tell you about Mary Shelley,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.080]   'cause here's the thing.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.680]   What you need to know is that the horror genre
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.960]   really came out of the sexual revolution.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.600]   What?
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.320]   Watch this.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.240]   Here's the real monster.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.840]   Check out this good-looking cat.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.200]   This brother, if he was at the porch, right here, not him,
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.040]   this guy.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.360]   If that other brother's at the porch too,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.240]   he'd say, "Get on out of here, old man.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.280]   "All right, this ain't for you."
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.040]   But that guy, that is the real monster.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.080]   That good-looking cat right there is Percy Shelley.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.260]   Percy Shelley was a Romantist poet who was part
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.940]   of the Enlightened Movement.
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.940]   Percy Shelley had an affair with one little girl named Mary
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.740]   who gallivanted with him all over Europe.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.100]   Percy Shelley remained married and had an affair with Mary.
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.600]   And as they traveled around, more and more,
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.900]   more despairing became Percy's wife
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.820]   until ultimately she killed herself.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.860]   This Romantic poet, betrayed the love of his life,
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.900]   taught about enlightenment and rationalism
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.300]   and finding hope in the human way,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.520]   a way that seems right to man,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.780]   but in the end leads to death.
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.220]   And it led to the death of his first wife.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.600]   And it led to the terrorization of his second wife,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.540]   whom he married, one Mary Shelley,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.220]   who he encouraged to have an open marriage,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.860]   to have sex with his friends.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.500]   Let me just tell you the story of Frankenstein
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.340]   in case you forgot it.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.140]   "Brick to Frankenstein," the book starts
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.840]   with a guy sailing up towards Antarctica
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.620]   and they find this guy in Antarctica roaming
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.100]   and they bring him on the boat and he's almost dead.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.980]   His name is Victor Frankenstein.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.820]   And Frankenstein goes on to tell Robert Walton,
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.100]   the man who was on this expedition to the North Pole,
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.020]   his story.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.260]   He says that he left his family, he became isolated,
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.940]   and he sought for truth in isolation.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.900]   Apart from any other revelation or any other moral compass,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.180]   Victor Frankenstein sought to educate himself and find more.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.420]   Now remember who's writing this, who's writing this?
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.180]   Percy Shelley's adulterous relationship wife.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:56.060]   And there is a guy that tells his rescuer, Robert Walton,
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.580]   that he has figured out a way to bestow animation
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.260]   upon lifeless manner.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.420]   In other words, he has learned to create life
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.060]   on his own terms apart from God.
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.260]   That's what Victor Frankenstein has done.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.220]   If you follow the story of Victor Frankenstein,
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.140]   you see that his experiment goes horribly wrong
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.780]   because the monster that he creates,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.620]   he was not pleased with the way that he looked.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.820]   In other words, the life that he got
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.780]   when he created life apart from God
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.060]   was a life that to him even became ugly.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.900]   And so the monster was cast out.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.300]   If you remember the story, he roamed around
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.300]   and he saw a family led by a blind man.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.140]   It was a compassionate man who taught his children to read
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.660]   and Frankenstein would peer through the window
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.900]   and learn to read and learn how human relationships work
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.260]   by watching this compassionate blind man
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.000]   who didn't see the way others see,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.100]   but saw something else, real beauty in individuals.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.260]   And Frankenstein eventually had the courage one day
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.300]   to go in and talk to this man because the man was blind,
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.260]   he didn't see the ugliness of the life that was created
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.140]   and he loved Frankenstein,
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.220]   but then this man's children came home,
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.640]   saw him and beat him and he ran away, the monster did.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.600]   And he was angry.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   And so watch what happens,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.620]   I don't have time to go into the whole story,
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.520]   but bottom line, what starts to happen
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.320]   is Victor Frankenstein's buddy,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.520]   his actually his younger brother,
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.760]   destroyed by the life that he created.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.640]   His best friend destroyed by the life that he created.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.440]   His father, seeing the horror that had come to his family
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.320]   through the life that his son had created,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.940]   died in grief.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.020]   Are you seeing a theme here?
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.780]   And the monster found Victor Frankenstein,
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.020]   said I'm not gonna kill you right now,
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.380]   but I know you love this dear woman
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.260]   and on your wedding night, I will haunt you.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.860]   You think what you do and what you create
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.100]   and the truth that you believe
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.460]   won't haunt you on your wedding night?
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.620]   You think the sexual revolution
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.100]   that you celebrate Percy Shelley
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.380]   won't haunt you on your wedding night?
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.780]   Mary Shelley is writing a story about what happens
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.960]   when men in his enlightened state
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.480]   says this is the beautiful life.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.280]   No, it's a monster and it destroys your family,
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.020]   it destroys your friends, it destroys your wedding.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.140]   You think I'm crazy?
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.200]   Let me just tell you something else.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.800]   I already, you knew because they titled the movie
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.960]   Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.520]   I said it myself, I'll say it again.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.120]   Who wrote Dracula?
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.500]   Bram Stoker's Dracula.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.520]   You know what Dracula is?
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.520]   Same guy, came right in the exact same enlightenment.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.540]   During the enlightenment, men were adulterous
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.260]   and believed that they should find their satisfaction
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.300]   in what made sense to man.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.660]   And so what happened is that during the enlightenment,
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.380]   all of a sudden there was an infection
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.300]   that came in the blood of men.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.300]   Syphilis ran through them.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.820]   And there were innocent women
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.000]   who had through blood transmission
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.660]   and bodily fluid transmission,
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.660]   that infection transmitted to them.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.760]   Dracula, what is it?
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.140]   It's a novel about a vampire
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.700]   who infects the blood of innocent girls.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.060]   Bram Stoker had syphilis.
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.400]   Let me tell you guys something, all right?
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.880]   When you try and find life apart from God,
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.960]   when you like Victor Frankenstein,
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.480]   bestow animation upon a lifeless matter,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.560]   in other words, when you try and make life exist
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.720]   where life doesn't exist, it always leads to death.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.480]   There is no other life except for the life
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.960]   that God gives you and he loves you
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.480]   and so he's calling you into a relationship with him.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.900]   Mary Shelley wrote an amazing book
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.020]   that you ought to go back and read
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.800]   'cause I know you didn't read it in high school.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.380]   You ought to go back and read the book
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.500]   and you ought to read it through the lens
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.540]   of the girl who wrote it.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.040]   When men lead in a way that seems right to men,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.600]   it ruins my life.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.700]   This woman was sexually tormented
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.660]   and she said, "Your monster has ruined my life.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.000]   "It killed your first wife.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.220]   "And it showed up on our wedding night and it's killing me."
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.940]   (whistles)
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.820]   Man, there is an enemy and you ought to know him
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.120]   and you ought to be on the alert
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.260]   and it is a hard story.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.100]   Let me tell you something, man.
[00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.380]   If you don't believe there is an enemy that is out there,
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.080]   you won't resist him.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.420]   You can't resist what you don't believe exists.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.620]   And when you're not sober and on the alert
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.060]   because you don't know that there's an adversary
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.900]   who wants to destroy you or when you think
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.800]   you need to fight him in a way that you shouldn't fight him
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.820]   because you've bought into some myth,
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.280]   you're gonna get your clock cleaned.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.620]   So we're gonna give you some truth tonight.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.520]   I'm gonna give you seven truths to defeat the liar.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.360]   Are you ready?
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.380]   Let's go.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:33.620]   Number one, there is no secret about what's coming
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.300]   or who it's coming from.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.900]   Now this is really important.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.300]   The very first thing I'm gonna tell you
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.060]   is that what's coming is a lie.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.100]   You guys don't probably sing a lot of hymns anymore.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.940]   That's okay.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.260]   We sing different kinds of hymns.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.020]   We sing beautiful music that focuses on the goodness of God
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.980]   and we learn about God's character and nature.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.460]   There was a guy, you're gonna hear more about him
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.600]   because 500 years ago this October,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.120]   we're gonna celebrate what he did
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   where he posted his thesis on a door in 1517.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.960]   Is that right?
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.800]   No, let's go back in 500 minus.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.160]   1517 in Wittenberg, all right?
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.400]   He put his 95 thesis up there
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.920]   and that 95 thesis was 95 things wrong
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.080]   with the way men are representing God on earth.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.600]   Martin Luther.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.120]   Martin Luther wrote a song called
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.920]   "A Mighty Fortress is Our God."
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.560]   And in that song, he talks about our enemy, the devil.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.840]   And he says in there, "One single word shall fell him."
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   You know what the single word is that shall fell the enemy?
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.360]   It's not be gone 'cause that's two words, all right?
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.360]   It's liar.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.200]   Liar.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.840]   That's the word Luther had in mind.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.320]   'Cause Luther knew it's the truth that will set you free.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.440]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.520]   If you think your interaction with the enemy
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.800]   is a power encounter,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.640]   you're gonna look to bring power to bear.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.480]   It's not a power encounter.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.000]   It is a truth encounter.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.220]   This is so significant, okay?
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.780]   This is the thing you gotta understand.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.400]   There should be no surprise about what's coming
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.500]   or who it's coming from.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.040]   What's coming is a lie.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.960]   He is a liar.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.200]   He's been that way from the beginning.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.000]   John chapter eight, verse 44.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.200]   "You," he says, "to false religious teachers,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.220]   "some of whom today exist and teach you the wrong way
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.960]   "to do war against the enemy."
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.920]   Jesus is saying to these guys,
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.040]   "You are of your father, the devil,
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.520]   "and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   "He was a murderer from the beginning.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.220]   "He came to steal, kill, and destroy.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.660]   "And he does not stand in the truth
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.340]   "because there is no truth in him.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.740]   "Whenever he speaks, he speaks a lie.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.400]   "He speaks from his own nature,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.120]   "for he is a liar and the father of lies."
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.140]   Which means whenever somebody starts to tell you something
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.360]   about this is where life can be found,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.820]   whether it's with a poem and a rose,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.520]   or sweet seduction or a soft caress,
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.920]   what you wanna do is ask,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.660]   "Is this action being informed by the author of love
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.120]   "and the God who cares for me
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.640]   "and withholds no good things from those who love him?"
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.620]   If you cannot trace back what this individual is doing
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.900]   to the word of God, you can be sure he is selling a lie.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.060]   And if you follow it,
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.000]   you're gonna find what Mary Shelley found,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.480]   that that man who says he loves you,
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.500]   that romantic poet who is sweeping you down a current
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.860]   of a relationship is going to be a monster
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.060]   and it will destroy you.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:34.160]   What is coming is a lie.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.660]   God isn't good, his word's not true.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.140]   Disobeying him is not that big a deal.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.660]   Go back, he shows up in your Bible in Genesis 3,
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.540]   and that's what he does.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.260]   He challenges the truth of God's word,
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.700]   he challenges your knowledge of it,
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.620]   and you're vulnerable to him
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.220]   if you don't know what truth is.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.380]   He challenges the idea of judgment,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.360]   he challenges the idea that God cares about you,
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.120]   because he is a liar.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.020]   What is coming, what is coming from him is temptation.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.940]   And it's coming to your flesh,
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.020]   which because you are a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve,
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.520]   your flesh is corrupted,
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.940]   which means we're all born with a sin nature.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.060]   Now, this is really important.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.940]   We live in a fallen world that is inhabited by a deceiver,
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.860]   and our flesh is corrupted.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.020]   Let me say that again.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.660]   We live in a fallen world that is run
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.100]   and that is inhabited by a deceiver
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.660]   underneath God's sovereignty.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.660]   God gave Satan the ability to be present on earth,
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.100]   but he gave us the ability to have dominion over the earth.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.220]   He is the prince of this world,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.780]   but we serve the king of all creation.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.420]   And so as servants of that king,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.020]   we don't have to listen to some little local prince.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.180]   He says, if you do, then you will live on this world
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.460]   that I wanted you to be a vice-regent on, a son of the king,
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.080]   you will live in bondage to him,
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.740]   and it will not go well with you.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.940]   So don't buy his lies.
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.180]   We've bought his lies,
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.580]   and we have handed down one generation to another
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.280]   a corrupt soul, a sin nature.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.420]   Now watch this.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.380]   In this world inhabited by a deceiver,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.620]   with our corrupt flesh,
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.100]   which we inherited from our father and mother,
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.740]   and we have well-established for the next generation
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   to inherit from us,
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:20.580]   in a world that is broken and runs according to this prince
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.620]   and rebels against God,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.780]   we are told, hey, you're going to be tempted.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.460]   Now this is James writing to the church,
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.420]   so check this out.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.260]   He says this in James 1:13,
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.580]   let no one say when he is tempted,
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.840]   I am being tempted by God,
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.120]   for God himself cannot be tempted by evil.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.180]   And he himself doesn't tempt anyone.
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.740]   God doesn't tempt anyone.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.100]   But each one is tempted when the scripture says
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.100]   he is carried away and is enticed by his own fallen nature,
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.940]   his own desire to find life apart from God,
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.060]   his own desire to bestow animation,
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.580]   to give life where life was not spoken to exist by God.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.380]   And when we, in our arrogance and belief
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.220]   that we don't need God,
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.060]   we can do it on our own,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.360]   when we go over here and we're carried away by that lust
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.040]   to have what we want our way and our time,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.380]   it always brings forth death,
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.060]   just like Victor Frankenstein's invention.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.680]   It says right here, do not be deceived,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.600]   my beloved brethren.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.440]   What do you see right here?
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.040]   Watch, this is really important.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.560]   Let me walk you through very carefully what it says.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.600]   It tells you here, be careful, okay,
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.520]   when you're being tempted and enticed by your own lust.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.800]   Notice it doesn't say when you're being enticed by,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.420]   and this is key,
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.140]   there's no surprise about what's coming
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:42.980]   or who it's coming from.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.940]   It doesn't say when you are tempted by the demon of lust.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:53.440]   It says when you're tempted by your own fallen nature,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.980]   temptation and evil is monolithic.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.040]   You're like, oh man, that's awesome,
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   that's a great, write that down.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.140]   What's monolithic mean?
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.260]   All right, let me tell you.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.900]   This is what monolithic mean.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.780]   When something is monolithic, it means it is one.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.540]   It is one stone, one piece,
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.900]   there is no division in it, okay?
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.140]   There is never any differentiation
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.340]   or distinction in the scripture
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.200]   about what we're doing battle against,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.900]   whether it's the prince of darkness,
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.080]   the adversary, the liar, the deceiver,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.860]   the world that has been deceived by him
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.860]   or the flesh that has been corrupted by him.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.140]   This is huge.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.540]   James is telling you, this is your problem.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.880]   When you're tempted and you're carried away,
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.260]   James says, by your own lust.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.300]   He could have said by the prince of deception.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.280]   He could have said by the course of the ways of the world.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.120]   Why?
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.340]   Because Paul later wrote to you,
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.580]   and he says this in Ephesians chapter two, verse one.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.500]   He says, listen, this is what you used to be
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.420]   before you were a Christian that James wrote to.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.020]   He said, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.260]   Now watch, in which you formerly walked according to,
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.080]   watch these three things,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.260]   the course of this world,
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.140]   according to the prince of the power of the air,
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.980]   according to the spirit that is now working
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.700]   in the sons of disobedient.
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.780]   All three of those things, it's the monolithic,
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.820]   it's, if you will, called the trinity of evil,
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.740]   the axis of evil.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.740]   What Italy and Japan and Germany were during World War II,
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.380]   that's what the world, the course,
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.140]   the current of this world, lower Greenville, all right?
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:27.340]   Stick that in your Houston context, all right,
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.700]   or your Fort Worth context.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.980]   You know, just that life is found apart from God,
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.020]   life, if it feels right, do it.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.460]   The course of this world, what your flesh thinks
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.500]   and what the enemy sells.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.380]   There is never a distinction, this is huge.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.740]   There's never a differentiation or distinction
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.060]   in doing battle against any of those three.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.620]   This is gonna matter big time
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.140]   when you think about how to go to war against it.
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.420]   'Cause you can't cast out your flesh.
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.660]   You're not gonna be somebody that says,
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.900]   I rebuke the whole world, and the world goes,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.300]   oh, you're right, we'll no longer have a Macy's Day parade
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.260]   that celebrates sin.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.820]   No, that's what the world does all the time.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.820]   It's always parading towards this life against God.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.380]   The enemy's always going to lie,
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.380]   and he's always going to be roaming about
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.700]   seeking someone to devour, and catch this,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.980]   your flesh is always going to want what it wants.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.540]   Don't be surprised that even after you know
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.140]   that God is good and he loves you and he's died for you,
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.260]   that your flesh still wants to sin.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.940]   When it says in the scripture, if any man is in Christ,
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.940]   therefore, if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.980]   Behold, old things are gone, new things have come.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.460]   I gotta tell you, I can remember when I trusted Christ,
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.540]   I couldn't believe that I still found myself
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.860]   lusting in my flesh.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.260]   I couldn't believe I still found myself
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.800]   wanting to spike in anger in my flesh.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.180]   I couldn't believe I was still attracted
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.700]   to all the things that I was attracted to before.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.500]   And I go, I thought I was supposed to be a new creature.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.660]   I thought I was never gonna wanna be, you know,
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.300]   prideful or self-absorbed again.
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.780]   I thought I was never gonna wanna objectify women again.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.260]   I thought I was never gonna be a slave to pornography again.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.340]   And I meant to, I prayed to receive Christ
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.540]   five or six times in the first 48 hours.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.880]   'Cause it must not have taken.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.100]   Because the old wasn't gone.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:17.940]   Yes, it was.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.900]   Here's the thing, let me explain that verse to you.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.500]   What had changed was my understanding about God.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.740]   Before I saw the beauty of God and his kindness towards me,
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.460]   that he wasn't mad, that he wasn't looking for me
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.260]   to build a resume and do my own works
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.540]   and become good enough, long enough
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.560]   that God would maybe one day accept me.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.300]   I saw God as a policeman that was there
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.700]   waiting to blow his whistle and, you know,
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.660]   knock me over the head with his little, you know, baton.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.340]   Or a principal or a teacher that was gonna go,
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.500]   "Hey, caught you, go down to that office."
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.420]   Or a referee that was gonna throw a flag on me.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.160]   Or some high standard I could never meet.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.900]   And so I really didn't want a relationship with God.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.740]   I just didn't wanna be busted by him.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.180]   And then all of a sudden I saw the beauty of God.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.740]   I saw that he loves guys like me.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.580]   He wanted to rescue me, not give me a bunch of rules.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.620]   The rules were there to show me
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.900]   what his holiness looked like.
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.420]   And to show me that I wasn't that guy.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.620]   And so I would cry out for mercy.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.180]   And when I asked for mercy, because he's a loving God,
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.220]   slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness and compassion,
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.540]   he would give me that mercy.
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.420]   And all of a sudden I go, "That's who God is.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.260]   "And he's not mad at me.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.380]   "He wants to reparent me and retrain me.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.240]   "He wants to give me the freedom to not listen to my flesh
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.660]   "or the deceiver that has corrupted my flesh
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.700]   "or the world that is identified
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.460]   "by a bunch of fleshes like I had."
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.620]   What had changed was my understanding of God.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.660]   And I no longer thought the spirit of this age
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.620]   was the spirit to follow.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.700]   The spirit of my flesh was the spirit to follow.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.300]   I now was no longer in a bondage to an unholy spirit.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.040]   I knew the truth about the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.940]   And so I would listen to him.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.300]   And prior to that, I never would listen to him.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:56.640]   So let me just start by just making it very clear right here
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.940]   that there is no secret about what is coming
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.060]   or who it's coming from.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.540]   What is coming is a lie.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.980]   It's not a power encounter.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.400]   It's not a demon of lust.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.820]   It's just lust.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.020]   Humans thinking that on their own,
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:17.420]   they can create animation in a lifeless matter.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:21.940]   I can make sex something that God never intended to be,
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.000]   and it can still be life-giving.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.040]   See, God loves sex.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.120]   God loves even drugs.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.960]   You know that?
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:38.120]   Everything is lawful and everything is good
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.760]   when it's sanctified by the word of God in prayer,
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   the scripture says.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.680]   This idea that sex is bad, don't mess with it,
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.480]   drugs are bad, no, drugs are a gift.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.720]   Ask my wife, who's delivered six children, okay?
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.360]   That little epidural, I mean, you know,
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.660]   she'd take her wedding ring off
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.480]   and put it right around that needle if she could.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.440]   Like, I love you, come here, all right?
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.680]   So when you use drugs correctly,
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.240]   not to pull you out of reality,
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.260]   but when you use drugs directly to help the sick
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.460]   and the hurting and to minimize the pain
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.320]   so we can excise that which is evil in your body
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.040]   and killing you, okay, it works.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.700]   It's sanctified by the word of God in prayer.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.980]   God's given us all these things.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.240]   You guys know that all drugs
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.040]   are basically derivative of plants,
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.480]   that he's given us the knowledge to understand
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.840]   how to break down, how to use.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.260]   But some of us use those plants to escape reality,
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.180]   not be victorious in it.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.640]   Is that glorious at all?
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.920]   You go, man, life's too hard for me.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.660]   I just smoke some weed and chill.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.240]   Well, that leaves the women and children
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.200]   in an awesome place, way to go, man.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.560]   Just tap out, just go take a trip
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.540]   while the rest of the world lives in sadness.
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.740]   And by the way, all you become
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.760]   is a bigger burden in the world.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.360]   And God's just saying, I can teach you to be a man
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.980]   and go to war against the world,
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.160]   but you gotta be sober, think clearly.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.400]   Number one, there is no secret, right?
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.880]   There is no secret about what's coming
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.720]   or who it's coming from.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.080]   Number two, are you ready?
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.960]   I hate that I'm a white American male
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.360]   who only gets to teach for 40 minutes.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.440]   I need to go to Africa where they teach half a day,
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.360]   eat lunch, and come back and finish the message.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.200]   That's where I wanna go.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.300]   All right, here we go.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.280]   But the floodwaters are rising in Houston,
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.680]   so we must hurry, here we go.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.140]   There is no shame, okay?
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.580]   Number two, there is no shame or sin in being tempted.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.560]   There is no shame or sin in being tempted.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.000]   It's a lie, okay?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.940]   Let me just show you something that's amazing, right?
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.840]   We are saved because we have a sinless Savior
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.240]   who went to a cross for us,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.380]   and God made him who knew no sin
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.680]   to become sin on our behalf
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.780]   that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.080]   Though he was rich, he became poor,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.580]   so that in his poverty we might become rich.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.800]   Why do I share those verses?
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.480]   Because that guy who was sinless,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.340]   who was rich in perfection, was tempted.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.380]   What's that tell you?
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.260]   Temptation is not sin.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.380]   Luke chapter four talks about Jesus.
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.220]   Watch this.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.060]   Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.120]   Listen, I would love if everybody started saying,
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.340]   Todd the other day, full of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.040]   I don't really care what comes after that.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.080]   All right?
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.240]   I would love that to be the case.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.960]   It was always the case with Jesus.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.100]   He's the perfect man, not because of any other reason
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.880]   than he always yielded to the will of God,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.980]   and he said no to lies, and he loved the truth.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.560]   Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.660]   and was led around by the Spirit in the wilderness
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.240]   for 40 days, being tempted by the devil.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.480]   One of the things that really just concerns me
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.200]   and scares me is the way certain people think
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.640]   if they're really spiritual, they wouldn't be tempted.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.500]   And I wanna let you know that that is not the mark,
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.120]   okay, of a godly individual.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.900]   If you don't admit, if you can't admit you are vulnerable,
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.820]   you're never going to seek protection and encouragement.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:17.320]   One of the things that you have to do is acknowledge,
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.220]   listen, I'm seriously tempted by this.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.160]   I tell my friends, look, you guys know enough
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.280]   Greek mythology to know about this concept
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.480]   called the Achilles heel.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.440]   And what typically happens, you know, guys,
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.560]   as they start to get my age, and they go out
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.320]   and they run like they used to run
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.080]   without stretching and being careful,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.080]   their body eventually gives in and their Achilles pops,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.120]   and it's awful.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.180]   It's a place of weakness in man.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.400]   And if you don't tell other people,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.080]   this is where I'm weak, this is where I'm getting attacked,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.240]   this is where the enemy can take me out.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.560]   If you don't tell others where that is,
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.600]   how can they encourage you and help you?
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.200]   This is what the scripture says.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.100]   It says we should encourage one another day after day,
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.240]   as long as it's still called today,
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.040]   so that none of us would be hardened
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.340]   by the deceitfulness of sin.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.280]   That's Hebrews chapter three, verse 13.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.960]   And I would just encourage you with this.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.920]   There is no shame.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.560]   It is not sin to be tempted.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.440]   Remember what it said back there in James chapter one?
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.200]   Each one is tempted when he's carried away
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.520]   by his own lust, and that lust then gives birth to sin.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.460]   But the temptation itself is not the problem.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.720]   It's that your flesh doesn't go lie, lie, right?
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.360]   Or actually, your flesh will never say lie.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.240]   Your flesh will say, give me that, give me that,
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.680]   give me that, but you do not need to be conformed
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.320]   to the world, but be transformed
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.720]   by the renewing of your mind.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.400]   That's what's new.
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.080]   God is good, his way is true.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.440]   All his ways are peace.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.720]   In his right hand is fullness of joy,
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.040]   in his left hand are pleasures forever.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.240]   Why would I go there?
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.000]   I'm not gonna lean on my own understanding,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.780]   but in all my ways, I'm going to acknowledge him,
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.600]   and he'll make my path straight.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.200]   But there is nothing wrong with saying,
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.360]   look, man, I'm tempted by same-sex attraction.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.300]   I'm tempted by fear of men.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.960]   I'm tempted by pornography.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.480]   I'm tempted to escape the world and smoke weed.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.320]   I'm tempted to hit Adderall.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.600]   I'm tempted to excessively diet.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.560]   I'm tempted to believe that I'll be happy
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.960]   if I make life pleasant
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.760]   because I'm more comfortable than others 'cause I'm rich.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.620]   There's nothing wrong with saying that.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.320]   In fact, it's helpful so people can come around you
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.360]   and help you with truth.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.720]   There is no sin in being tempted, number three.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.480]   There is no such thing as a faithful man
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.920]   who surrenders to temptation.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.520]   Proverbs says this.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.800]   It says, "Many a man proclaims his loyalty,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.520]   "but who can find a trustworthy man?"
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.960]   There is no such thing as a godly man or a faithful man
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.000]   or a godly woman or a faithful woman
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.400]   who surrenders to temptation.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.040]   Now watch, this is important.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.780]   Notice I did not say there is no such thing
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.020]   as a godly man who doesn't sin.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:12.000]   And there is a significant difference
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.200]   between a godly man and a faithful man.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   This is one of the issues that I am zealous for my friends
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.600]   with same-sex attraction to hear.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.960]   Because for too long, for too long,
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   guys who were communicating in positions like mine,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.880]   acted like the temptation towards the same sex
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.120]   was an offense to God, and until you could no longer be
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.160]   tempted towards men, you would never be a godly person.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.620]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.680]   As long as you can remember,
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.240]   that's what your flesh was drawn to, guy or girl.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   And when you trust Christ, I'm not here to tell you
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.160]   that all of a sudden you're no longer going to have
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.140]   same-sex attraction in the same way that just because
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.280]   I've walked with Jesus for 30 years and had a ring
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.640]   in my hand for 26, 27 years,
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.540]   that I'm not attracted to other women.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:09.040]   But what happens is I don't surrender to that
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.700]   which seems right to me.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.440]   I don't lean on my own understanding.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.980]   But in all my ways, I acknowledge him
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.040]   and he'll make my paths straight.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.800]   But for me to have to act like I'm no longer
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.520]   sordidly tempted or seriously tempted by something else
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.440]   is crazy, and for somebody else to say,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.200]   I'm just gonna surrender to that and Jesus is okay with that
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.720]   I'm gonna go, no, no.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.680]   What fellowship does darkness have with light?
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.820]   How can you say I'm going to do what God said is unholy
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.720]   and the Holy Spirit is okay with that?
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.700]   But it is crazy, okay?
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.860]   I mean, listen, I'm gonna just drop a couple of these
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.460]   in here, you know, I do something every now and then
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.060]   to kind of give stuff to you in a shorter way
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.860]   since sometimes my first point lasts 18 minutes.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.620]   I sometimes, I do stuff called Real Truth Real Quick
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.540]   and I did one on gay reparative therapy
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.840]   or conversion therapy.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.100]   And what's a biblical view of that?
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.340]   And I want you to go listen to it.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.140]   I want you to be informed about what your gay friends
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.020]   are going through and they're not gay
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.100]   if they're followers of Christ,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.380]   they're sinners who struggle with same sex attraction.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.460]   They're not gay.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.580]   In the same way I'm not a lech and an adulterer.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.020]   I'm tempted towards that.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]   That's not who I am.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.360]   We don't ever identify ourself by our sexual desires,
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.720]   sexual accomplishments or sexual escapades.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.420]   We identify ourself by the love of God.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.100]   And we acknowledge that our flesh may still go
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.420]   a certain direction.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.780]   Let me say this to you, number three,
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:35.920]   this is very important.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.780]   There's no such thing as a faithful man,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.900]   a person who's serious about following God
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.420]   who surrenders to that which is contrary
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.380]   to the word of God.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.160]   A lie.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:52.500]   Fourthly, there is no saint who is beyond
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.160]   falling or screwing up.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.380]   I have a gentleman that I had the privilege
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.980]   of meeting one time, his name's Michael Cromartie.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.820]   He just died.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.420]   He was a godly man who lived in D.C.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.420]   and he worked in the corridors of power
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.220]   and was a great blessing to our nation.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.940]   No one really even knew Michael Cromartie
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.420]   but he was an amazing man.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.900]   And one of the things I heard him say one time
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.900]   that I frankly, you know, I'm asked a lot
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.220]   when people ask me about men that fall,
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   they say things like, "Todd, are you shocked by that?"
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.580]   And Cromartie said this and I've used it like it's mine.
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.140]   And I said this, "I'm never surprised by weakness or sin.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:30.740]   "I'm just not."
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:31.700]   You know what I'm surprised by?
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:32.940]   I'm surprised by virtue.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.220]   I'm surprised by godly character
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.980]   because I just, in this world that is run by a liar,
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.540]   where every piece of flesh in it
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.300]   is longing to rebel against God
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.400]   and the course of this world
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.440]   is to draw our flesh away from God,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.260]   I'm always surprised when I see people
[00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.460]   by the grace of God and the power of God,
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.540]   through the knowledge of God and the grace that works in men,
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.160]   see people resist sin and live holy, virtuous lives.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.520]   Can I tell you guys something?
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.820]   I run scared, man.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.520]   I am so aware of the fact that I could be next.
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.780]   I'm so aware that I could do things
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.300]   that would dishonor my God,
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.100]   that would be a death to my bride,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.720]   that would kill my closest friends,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.400]   that would grieve my father,
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.560]   and that would terrorize my community,
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.460]   that I pay attention to the word of God.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.740]   I meditate on it day and night
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.100]   so I might be careful to do according to all that is written
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.680]   and let me just say this, man, be afraid, be very afraid.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.280]   Billy Graham, that we all love
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.820]   and is soon coming to the end of his life,
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.500]   we love Billy Graham because he's one of the few guys
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.660]   that we think wasn't corrupted
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.480]   in the way that so many other guys are corrupted
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.780]   when they become celebrated as spiritual men.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.300]   Billy Graham was always a guy that said,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.340]   "Man, Billy, what's the secret to you being successful
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.260]   "in your walk with Christ?"
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.700]   He says, "I run scared."
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.420]   Another way to say it is I'm on the alert.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.140]   I'm sober-minded because I've got an adversary, the devil,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.140]   who roams around seeking someone to devour
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.120]   and I don't think because I've preached
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.400]   to massive amounts of folks
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.720]   and been in stadiums all around the world
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.080]   that I am not capable of messing up.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.600]   I know exactly who it is.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.320]   Guys who blow it in ministry,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.400]   always, you can almost track it,
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.440]   they're guys who become lazy
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.120]   in their personal relationship with God.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.680]   They become focused on doing spiritual things
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.660]   but not in being a spiritual person.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:28.360]   In devoting themselves daily and meditating on God's word
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.080]   and being alone, away from crowds,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.680]   away from human celebration,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.320]   they also have a tendency
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.800]   because they become a man of renown
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.160]   and folks wanna spend time with them,
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.500]   they spend time with people who are fans
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.120]   as opposed to brothers who rebuke and encourage them
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.400]   and challenge them and also,
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.260]   they're often approached by members of the opposite sex
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.560]   and maybe out of a desire to be compassionate towards them,
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.640]   they spend time with them and alone with them
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.220]   and boom, trouble comes.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:59.000]   And you see it, man,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.240]   they grow lazy in your personal relationship,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.000]   they begin counseling, spending time in isolation
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.640]   with individuals of the opposite sex
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.840]   or if they're same sex attracted with men of the same sex
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.660]   and they say, you know,
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.720]   I just didn't think it would happen to me.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.360]   Can I just tell you guys something?
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.520]   I will not be surprised if it happens to me
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.380]   if I ever become lazy in my spiritual disciplines,
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.360]   if I ever start to spend time alone
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.960]   counseling a woman out of compassion
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.440]   and if I ever think it won't happen to me.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.560]   You can almost bet it will.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:36.880]   But I will to not sin.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.080]   You won't hear me say I will not sin.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.320]   And man, some of you guys come up and go,
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.360]   man, Wagner, I pray for you
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.260]   and I just go, well, that explains it.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.080]   Thank you.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.360]   There but by the grace of God go I.
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.180]   I'm telling you something,
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.280]   one of the hardest things I've gotta do
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.080]   is convince you that I've gotta go to war
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.640]   to make my marriage a blessing.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.960]   I've gotta go to war so that I'm not an idiot
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.040]   and a tyrant as a daddy.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.640]   I've gotta go to war so I'm not swayed
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.600]   by public adoration and by the praise of men.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.360]   I've gotta go to war or I am next.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.260]   God is opposed to the proud
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.520]   but gives grace to the humble.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.880]   A prudent man, the scripture says,
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.040]   sees evil and hides himself.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:18.860]   Let me just say one thing.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.560]   The glory of young men is their strength
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.480]   but in Proverbs 20, 29, it says,
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.400]   the honor of old men is their gray hair.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.640]   In other words, they live around for a while
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.900]   and young men always think, I got this,
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.700]   I can take this on, I got it, man, here I go, watch me.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.320]   And that's not good.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.980]   Look, I tell guys all the time,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.240]   if you are a wildebeest and you're hanging out with lions,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.360]   you're not courageous, you're next.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.460]   That's just the way it's gonna go, okay?
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.340]   And so if you sleep with the dogs,
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.780]   you're gonna wake up with fleas.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.400]   Bad company corrupts good morals.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.920]   You mess around, you're in trouble.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.560]   Let me just tell you guys something.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.800]   It is a fact.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.280]   A discretion is the better part of valor.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.440]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.480]   The prudent see evil and they hide themselves
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.200]   but the naive go on and they are punished for it.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.020]   Yeah, they don't play with snakes, all right?
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   So this is one of those moments, don't try this at home.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:10.120]   That was when I was in India and I was,
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.460]   I should've been bitten right there in the face
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.000]   by that cobra and I wasn't.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.480]   So they threw that up there just to go,
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.960]   okay, Wagner, practice what you preach.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.440]   That was not my best moment.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.500]   I predict if I do that again,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.960]   I will have fang marks right here.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.860]   Okay, here we go.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.640]   But we hypnotized him and charmed him, right?
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.680]   Yeah, okay, all right, not my best moment.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.800]   All right, thank you, here we go.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.760]   There are no special cases.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   That's number five.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.360]   There are no special cases.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.320]   One of the things that I hear a lot from individuals
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.760]   is that they go, man, you don't understand my pain.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.680]   I sometimes, the people come up and go,
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.560]   hey man, can I talk to you?
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.400]   I go, sure, what do you got?
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.920]   Well, come here, I need to talk to you alone, man.
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:52.540]   I mean, come over here, just over here.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.380]   Well, why?
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.000]   Because I don't know if you can handle this,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.240]   or I don't know if you've never heard
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.540]   anything like this before.
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.160]   Can I just tell you something?
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:02.220]   You are unique.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.260]   I mean, you are unique.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.920]   You have your own temptation,
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.200]   you've got your own family history,
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.800]   you've got your own family of origin,
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.360]   you've got your own sin struggles that are intense.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.860]   You are unique, just like everybody else.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:22.420]   And this is what my Bible says, and it's true.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.240]   First Corinthians chapter 10, verse 13.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.960]   No temptation has overtaken you,
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.360]   but such as is common to man.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.820]   One of the ways you're gonna get in trouble
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.860]   is if you believe that you're a special case,
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.520]   that you're a same-sex attraction,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.480]   that you're addiction to pornography,
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:42.120]   that you're excessive dieting,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.000]   that you're bulimia, that you're addiction to men,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.940]   that the abuse that you suffered from as a child
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.640]   is so unique that somehow
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.980]   there's some special parentheses of grace
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.440]   that you can do whatever you're gonna do
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:58.160]   and surrender to it and God understands.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.000]   Can I just tell you this?
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.300]   First Corinthians 10, 13.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   No temptation has overtaken you,
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.440]   but such as is common to man.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.600]   Everybody feels what you feel.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.520]   And God is faithful, and he will not allow you
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.880]   to be tempted beyond what you are able,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.360]   but with the temptation will provide the way of escape
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.820]   also so that you might be able to endure it.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.380]   But you gotta want it, and you gotta go get it.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.200]   Be strong in the Lord, the scripture says,
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.280]   in the strength of his might.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.120]   The armor of God that we talked about last week
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.240]   is available to all of you.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.440]   You've gotta put it on.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.440]   There are no special cases.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:39.720]   Number six.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.280]   There's no silver bullet.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.600]   Now this one's really important.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.200]   All right, I told you that Frankenstein, Dracula,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.320]   what's the third one in the Trinity in the axis of evil?
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.400]   Werewolves, all right?
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.960]   Werewolves, all right, Dracula by a wooden stake.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.480]   Frankenstein by dying to that which you thought
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.980]   would give you life and repenting,
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:10.040]   because that was Victor Frankenstein's last words,
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.360]   kill the beast that I have created.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.820]   It is ruinous to humankind.
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.220]   The enlightenment of man always is.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.440]   The wooden stake is what kills the bloodlust.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:27.700]   And what was that which took out a werewolf?
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.540]   Silver bullet.
[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.840]   There is no silver bullet.
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.640]   One of the things that I hear way too often
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.820]   is that folks will tell you that the way you do
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:41.020]   spiritual warfare is you do what is called ex-ballo.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.500]   You cast out, so in Greek, okay, we get the word ballistics
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.340]   from the word in Greek, ballo, B-A-L-L-O.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.660]   That's what the word ballistics means.
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.220]   It means to throw.
[00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.380]   When you pull a gun, ballistics is the study
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.820]   and the science of what is thrown out of a barrel
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.180]   and how far it will go based on the shape of the barrel,
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.020]   the force, the amount of gunpowder that is in there,
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:08.020]   and the shape of the bullet itself, the cartridge.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.580]   That's the study of ballistics, how far you throw it out.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.300]   There is an idea today that the way you go to war
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.060]   against Satan is by casting him out, ex-ballo.
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.500]   You throw him out and you will be set free.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.340]   No, you don't.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.240]   Remember, there is a monolithic enemy.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:31.260]   We sometimes say it is the deception of the enemy.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.380]   Sometimes it is our flesh, which is a slave to deception.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.540]   Sometimes it is the course of this world,
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.220]   and there is no distinction or differentiation
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.680]   about how we go to war against any one of them.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.580]   It's always trust and obey.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.980]   There is no other way to be happy in Jesus
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.380]   but to trust and obey.
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:50.180]   You wanna be victorious over sin?
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:53.340]   Don't go to some crazy place that's gonna cast out demons
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.100]   and people convulse.
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.680]   There is no demon of lust to get rid of.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.300]   There is lust in your flesh.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.560]   Even if you get rid of the so-called demon of lust,
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.460]   your flesh is still corrupt and fallen.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:08.300]   The Bible has no program to curb your flesh.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.660]   You are to die to it and let Christ live.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:16.980]   Therefore, Paul writes, I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.940]   In the life I now live in the flesh,
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.860]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.200]   who loved me and delivered himself up for me.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.680]   I must decrease, John the Baptist said,
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:27.740]   but he must increase.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.540]   We are to yield to the Spirit.
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.840]   We are to continue to be controlled by the Spirit.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.340]   And when I don't live according to my own understanding
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.540]   or follow my flesh, I walk in the way that is straight.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.680]   There is no enemy that I am to cast out or bind
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.260]   if you wanna know where Satan is bound.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.400]   Listen to a real truth real quick.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.620]   Can we bind Satan?
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.840]   Or just know this, Satan will be bound
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.320]   during the millennial reign of Christ in Revelation 20.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.380]   Before that, he is a roaring lion
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.060]   seeking whom he may devour.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:57.740]   And if you think that you have killed him,
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.680]   you are just setting yourself up.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.140]   And it's a problem.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.820]   So there is no silver bullet, okay?
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   Watch this, I'm gonna read you
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.860]   from 2 Timothy 4, one through eight.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.740]   I solemnly charge you in the presence of God
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.520]   and of Jesus Christ, who is the judge of living
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.360]   and the dead, and by his appearing in his kingdom,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.120]   preach the word, be ready in season and out of season,
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.660]   reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction.
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.120]   For the time will come when men will not endure
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.180]   sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled,
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.320]   they will accumulate for themselves,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.400]   teach us in accordance with their own desire.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.100]   What's more attractive to you if I tell you,
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.160]   come over here to this powerful ministry that I've got
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.780]   where I will cast out demons from people
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:36.760]   and set you free from the bondage of the enemy,
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.520]   or hey, come over here with me
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.800]   and discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.280]   Come to this one-time event and we will deliver you
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.020]   from the demon of, boom, or come over here
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.420]   and go to war with me and not entangle yourself
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.500]   in the affairs of everyday life
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:51.560]   in order that you might please the one
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.400]   who has enlisted you as a soldier.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.560]   Die to yourself continually, day by day,
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.080]   or hey, there's a big revival happening
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.960]   and the power of God will be unknown
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.620]   when we will once and forever bind Satan.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.480]   Which one of those two gets you fired up?
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.380]   Man, give me the quick pill.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.360]   It just isn't in your Bible.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.680]   Nowhere from Romans to Revelation
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.060]   do you ever see the church told to cast out a demon.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.680]   Well, Todd, what about what Jesus did?
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.960]   Aren't we supposed to WWJD?
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.520]   No, you're not, you're not Jesus.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.800]   It's not what would Jesus do 'cause you're not Jesus.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.760]   How about what would Jesus have me do?
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.160]   All right, whatever that is, put that on your bracelet.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.000]   All right?
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.880]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.480]   And what Jesus would have you do is to walk with him
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.640]   and to trust him
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.040]   and to be sober-minded
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.200]   and delight yourself in the law of the Lord.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.160]   Lastly, there's no sense in going at it alone.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.880]   In other words, you were not made to do this alone, okay?
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.880]   My friend who is in the Navy SEALs,
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.160]   the Navy SEALs have an expression
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.280]   which is two is one and one is none.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.520]   We just don't go by ourself, right?
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.160]   We all know Marcus Luttrell.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.000]   They made a movie about him.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.820]   What's the movie called?
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.660]   "Lone Survivor."
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.500]   Well, guess what?
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.500]   Marcus didn't survive because he was alone.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.580]   Marcus survived because people cared for him.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.800]   Even a Navy SEAL.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.020]   The mightiest warriors, they had the wisdom to know
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.060]   you don't go at this alone.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.740]   If any man separates himself, he seeks his own desire,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.220]   he quarrels against all sound wisdom.
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.060]   Let me just tell you something, man.
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.360]   If you're not a part of a church
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.420]   underneath godly leadership,
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.460]   who doesn't lord it over you but serves you
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.180]   and cares for you and shepherds you
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.980]   and puts you in accountable community
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.220]   where they are gracious towards you
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.780]   and patient towards you and reprove you
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.180]   and exhort you with great patience and instruction.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.420]   If you love Jesus so much you don't need anybody else,
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.840]   you don't love Jesus 'cause you're not listening.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.740]   If you're a serious follower of Christ
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:52.460]   and you're not deeply connected with a body, okay,
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:54.660]   you are seeking your own desire.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.860]   A wildebeest that gets pushed out from the herd,
[00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:00.340]   it's the one that's eaten.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.900]   There's no sense in going at this alone.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.620]   It was not God's intention.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.980]   When you get a member of the body of Christ
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.020]   and you take him away and put him over there,
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.580]   he is dismembered, it is a grotesque picture.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.740]   When you get a sheep away from the shepherd
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.260]   and the rest of the flock, he's called a meal.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.500]   That's what they call a sheep who's over there by himself.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.900]   Not a stud sheep.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:30.860]   There's no sense in going at it alone, man.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.500]   We're called to bear one another's burdens
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.580]   and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.220]   God loves you and he wants you to be a part of a family.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.060]   So come on, man, come on.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.420]   Let me just give you one eighth one
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:40.360]   and I'll do this in a minute.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.200]   Are you ready?
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.760]   Because if you're listening to me out there,
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.940]   some of you guys as believers,
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.620]   you've gotta get this stuff correct.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:51.620]   You've gotta see why you're called to daily seek the King
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.060]   and to abide with him in community
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.260]   and to get rid of this false theology that's out there
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.940]   and start to learn what the Bible says.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.340]   That's how you go to war against the unseen
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.060]   and how you live victorious in a way that people can see.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.060]   There's something different about you.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.700]   Who are you that you're not a slave
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.020]   to the prince of this world like I am?
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:11.500]   Answer, I'm a son of the King and I abide with him
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.300]   and he lives and he lives in me.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.460]   I used to think he was bad
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.100]   and I had to manage my relationship with him.
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.140]   I used to run from him and avoid him
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:19.060]   and suppress his word and unrighteousness,
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.820]   but now I listen to him and he is kind and good

[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.020]   if you knew I was a Mary Shelley who threw myself
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.060]   at the Romantic poet one after another,
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.420]   if you knew the children that I killed
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.060]   because I ran with Percy Shelley,
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.020]   you wouldn't be telling me that I could be
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.020]   a child of the King.
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.340]   And can I just give you one last truth?
