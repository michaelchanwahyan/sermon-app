4
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,240
 All right, Porch, how are we doing tonight?

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
 You doing OK?

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,040
 It's great to see you.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,760
 Thanks for making the time to join us.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,120
 I never take it for granted that you would step away

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,640
 from whatever else you could be doing

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,480
 and you would be in the room with us.

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,080
 I think God has something special in store for tonight,

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,720
 not just for the people in Dallas, Texas,

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,880
 though I think that's true.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,920
 Also for all of you that are tuning in online

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,360
 all over the place, thanks so much

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,160
 for being a part of the Porch.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,760
 Special shout out to Porch Live Midland and Springfield

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,040
 and Greater Lafayette.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,120
 We love you guys.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,520
 We think that God genuinely can meet with anybody

21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,200
 at any time and in any place, and that includes you.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,960
 So we're really grateful that you're here with us tonight.

23
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
 Well, a couple of years ago, Brooke and I

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,360
 took a cruise where one of the stops along the way

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,400
 was to the island of Belize.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
 Anybody been to Belize before?

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,880
 OK, yeah.

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,760
 If you haven't been, which we had not,

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,920
 what you need to know is that in order to get to the island,

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,640
 you actually have to take a ferry from the ship

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
 to arrive at the port.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,480
 You can't just dock the ship right against the shoreline.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,560
 You have to catch a ferry.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
 And so knowing that we were going

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880
 to have to catch a ferry to get there,

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,960
 the recommended pathway is to know

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,360
 what you're going to do should you go to the island.

38
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,680
 And we didn't have any plans.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
 And so we thought, OK, we need to figure it out.

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,440
 We don't want to necessarily miss out on an opportunity

41
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,680
 to experience a new country.

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,200
 And so let's go visit with the excursion guide.

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,760
 Let's figure out what they would recommend we can do

44
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,520
 and assess our options and pick something

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,560
 that could be really fun.

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,520
 So we go and we visit with the tour guide.

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,400
 And they tell us all the different things,

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
 the smattering of opportunity that

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
 exists within the cruise that you

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,720
 can participate on the shore.

51
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
 And yet, as we finish our conversation with them,

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
 they share with us one very critical rule

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,040
 to live by, which was do not go to shore unless you

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,680
 book an excursion through us.

55
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,280
 Don't go to shore unless you book an excursion through us.

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,920
 And so naturally, we chose to book an excursion

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,240
 through someone else entirely.

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,880
 No offense to the cruise line.

59
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,360
 It's just way cheaper to book through something like Expedia.

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,920
 And so we were excited.

61
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,720
 The day arrived.

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,800
 We had made this incredible plan of what we would

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,160
 do when we got to the shore.

64
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,120
 And so we get up, and the sun's shining,

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,320
 and the birds are singing, and the weather's perfect.

66
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
 And we go down, and we get on the ferry.

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
 We make our way to shore.

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,400
 And as we take a look around the town square of Belize

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,960
 for our reputable tour agency, they

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,080
 were nowhere to be found.

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,440
 Instead of a tour agency, there was one Captain Tom

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,960
 waiting for us with his quote, unquote,

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,040
 "company van," which was suspect, to say the least.

74
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,360
 You see, we had been duped.

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
 We had shown up expecting one thing, promised

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
 the experience of a lifetime.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
 And yet, here we were in the middle of a foreign country

78
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,800
 about to journey into a random jungle with a total stranger

79
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,120
 that we knew nothing about.

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
 How do you think we felt in that moment?

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,120
 Betrayed would be a really good assessment of the situation,

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,320
 because that's what we felt.

83
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
 We were expecting one thing, but we'd

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,200
 received something else instead.

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,280
 And I'm not judging Tom.

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,160
 I don't know the guy.

87
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,660
 I want to believe the best about him.

88
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,680
 And yet, what I know is this is the stuff of 60 Minutes.

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,760
 You know, it's a young married man

90
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,520
 with his newly betrothed wife in the middle of a foreign country

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,400
 journeying into a jungle of unknown proportion

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,380
 in the back of a serial killer van with a stranger

93
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,960
 that we know nothing about.

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,400
 This is the kind of stuff that makes the headlines back home.

95
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,780
 So I was having no part of it.

96
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,640
 We were not going to take this trip.

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,800
 You ever been in a spot like that, where you thought

98
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,720
 you were going to get one thing, but you ended up

99
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,680
 getting something else?

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,800
 You were promised something, but you received something else

101
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,300
 instead?

102
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,440
 Maybe it was that product you ordered off of Timu.

103
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,080
 It showed up.

104
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,040
 And it was just a couple sizes too small

105
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
 whenever it finally arrived.

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
 Looked promising, but it just didn't deliver.

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,660
 Maybe it was the perfect car at the perfect price.

108
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,440
 And you've been searching for a long time,

109
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,360
 and you finally make your way, and you see it.

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,880
 And you start to look it over.

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,880
 They hand you the car fax, and you realize it's a lemon.

112
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,560
 It won't even crank up.

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,080
 Maybe it's not a product you bought.

114
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
 Maybe it's someone you matched with online,

115
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,240
 because that never happens.

116
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,420
 You show up expecting them to be one person,

117
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,800
 and yet they're a completely different person in real life.

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
 Maybe it's not that.

119
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
 Maybe it's a three-carat diamond ring

120
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,440
 that in your responsible adulting,

121
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,200
 you decided to go and get appraised only

122
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,360
 to learn that it's the highest quality CZ on the market.

123
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,320
 You see, we've all been there.

124
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,560
 And while the cost varies depending on the situation,

125
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,120
 the reality is it's costly nonetheless.

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,040
 But what if it isn't just something physical?

127
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
 What if it's something spiritual?

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,960
 What if it's something that you didn't just lose money on

129
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,800
 that you bought?

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,840
 What if it's some part of yourself you lost

131
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,820
 because of someone you believed in?

132
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,580
 What if you placed your trust in that pastor,

133
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,920
 or that religious leader, or that parent,

134
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,880
 or that student leader from your childhood,

135
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,500
 or some spiritual seeker that was giving you guidance,

136
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,900
 and what you realized is though you had placed your trust

137
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,040
 in them, they did not deliver what you expected.

138
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,380
 They betrayed that trust.

139
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,700
 If that's you, then this night's for you.

140
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,300
 See, last week we shared that we're in the middle

141
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,220
 of a new series called Deconstructed,

142
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,600
 where we're trying to rebuild your reality,

143
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,700
 because the truth of the matter is,

144
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,420
 many of us have had our reality totally wrecked

145
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,100
 by somebody at some place at some point in the past.

146
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,580
 And often it's most tragically done

147
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,180
 by those that should have been building our reality,

148
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,180
 boosting our belief, constructing our faith, Christians.

149
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,100
 And what do we do when we find ourselves

150
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,940
 in the midst of something like that?

151
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,940
 Well, according to Pew Research, just last year,

152
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,500
 they found that many people choose to

153
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,300
 unaffiliate with religiosity entirely.

154
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,980
 In their study, they found that 28%,

155
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,300
 meaning over a quarter of Americans

156
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,780
 religiously identified as nones,

157
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,100
 not N-U-N-S, but N-O-N-E-S.

158
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,900
 They were religiously unaffiliated.

159
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,740
 And what's surprising, it actually made them

160
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,460
 the largest religious group in America today.

161
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,020
 Bigger even than Protestants or Catholics.

162
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,980
 When asked why people had become irreligious,

163
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,020
 their responses ranged between one of two things.

164
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,620
 Either they didn't like the religious organization,

165
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,580
 or they had a bad experience with that religious group

166
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,300
 at some point in the past,

167
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
 meaning that we no longer live in a post-Christian age.

168
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,860
 We actually live in an anti-Christian age,

169
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,220
 where people are no longer just indifferent to Christians.

170
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,540
 They're actually antagonistic towards Christians.

171
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,940
 They've had some experience with us at some point

172
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,780
 where they look and say,

173
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,220
 "Man, I just don't know that this is worth it."

174
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,500
 And oftentimes, they have good reason.

175
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,740
 Many people have tried Christianity,

176
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,740
 and they've found antiquated answers for modern problems,

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,580
 and yet whenever they pushed it up against the real world,

178
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,860
 they found those answers were lacking.

179
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,820
 Others found that the religion they were ascribing to,

180
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,140
 it demanded their obedience,

181
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,100
 and in the process, it distorted their personality,

182
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,940
 and it damaged their mental health forever,

183
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,660
 and they're still working to this day

184
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,380
 to pick up the pieces.

185
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,660
 Others, they know that,

186
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,380
 man, someone that they trusted,

187
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,580
 they ended up getting betrayed by

188
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,420
 because they played the part of the hypocrite.

189
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,660
 They hid something in secret.

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,980
 They did something egregious.

191
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,580
 They abused someone innocent,

192
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,820
 and at the sight of all of that, once exposed,

193
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,940
 they said, "I have to get out of this

194
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,260
 "because this does not seem like something

195
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,980
 "I want to be a part of."

196
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,780
 Others, they just look at Christianity,

197
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,840
 and they think it is synonymous with political idolatry.

198
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
 They think that it's the stuff

199
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,040
 of hysterical conspiracy theory.

200
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,420
 In 2021, there was a survey conducted

201
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,900
 that found one in four Christians

202
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,540
 agreed with this statement.

203
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,580
 "The government, media, and financial worlds in the US

204
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,180
 "are controlled by a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles

205
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,220
 "who run a global child sex trafficking operation."

206
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,420
 One in four Christians agreed with that statement.

207
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,400
 We hear stuff like that,

208
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,340
 and we don't know how to feel about it.

209
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,180
 Like, if that's what these people think,

210
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,140
 I don't know that I want to be a part of these people

211
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,080
 because it sounds like their way of thinking is too narrow.

212
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,020
 It's too violent.

213
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,180
 It's too imperialistic.

214
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,380
 It seems pretty toxic.

215
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,980
 It's probably homophobic.

216
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,260
 It's likely patriarchal in some sense,

217
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,860
 and I don't know that I actually find it believable.

218
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,540
 If that's you, and you're here tonight,

219
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,780
 and you've thought one of those things

220
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,220
 at some point in the past,

221
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,700
 and you would honestly identify

222
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,060
 that you're on the road to deconstruction

223
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,860
 at some level, maybe you're at the beginning,

224
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,900
 maybe you're in the middle,

225
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,780
 maybe you're at the final stop,

226
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,780
 what you need to know is you're in good company

227
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,140
 because nobody defended the religiously ridiculed

228
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,300
 and the spiritually traumatized like Jesus.

229
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,880
 You see, when you read the Gospels,

230
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,440
 what you find is Jesus, he stands up for those

231
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,260
 that the religious would beat down or push aside.

232
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,780
 He defends the woman caught in adultery

233
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,460
 as she's thrown at his feet.

234
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,140
 He kneels down beside her,

235
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,540
 and he tells the people to cast stones,

236
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,600
 yet none of them can because none of them are without sin.

237
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,420
 He defends her.

238
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,300
 We find that he protects the woman of the city

239
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,260
 as he's sitting at Simon the Pharisee's house.

240
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,100
 We know that the woman at the well,

241
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,820
 he takes time to actually listen to her story,

242
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,540
 which catches her so off guard

243
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,700
 because he's a religious leader,

244
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,620
 and typically her experience has proved

245
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,560
 that those people are harsh.

246
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,740
 Instead, we know that there was a series where,

247
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,980
 there was a scene where a man was brought to him

248
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,300
 and Jesus decided to heal him on the Sabbath,

249
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,780
 which violated one of the Old Testament observances,

250
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,780
 and yet Jesus raises the bar and actually identifies

251
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,900
 what that rule was always intended for.

252
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,540
 We see that he sits with sinners and tax collectors

253
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,260
 over dinner despite the fact

254
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,680
 that the religious ridiculed them,

255
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,100
 and what we know is Jesus himself

256
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,540
 was even religiously wounded by those

257
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,940
 that claimed to love the same God.

258
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,720
 He came to promote himself.

259
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,340
 Jesus knows a thing or two about church hurt,

260
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,740
 and so if you're here and that's your story,

261
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,140
 then you're in good company.

262
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,980
 I think he wants to meet you in yours.

263
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,420
 Like this is not a message of hype.

264
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,960
 This is not a series of hype.

265
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,180
 These are evenings of help.

266
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,700
 We just wanna read the scripture

267
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,140
 and we wanna see the heart of God

268
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,420
 and we wanna have him meet us in whatever it is

269
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,980
 we find ourselves in because many of us tonight,

270
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,660
 we are in the middle of church hurt,

271
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,420
 and my belief is that he wants to restore

272
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,620
 your relationship to the church.

273
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,400
 Like just because you've had bad doctors

274
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,260
 doesn't mean you give up

275
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,500
 on the idea of hospitals altogether,

276
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,580
 and yet before Jesus restores your relationship to the church

277
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,900
 he wants to restore your relationship to himself

278
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,260
 because he is the one that leads the church.

279
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,980
 He wants you to have a right relationship with the bride,

280
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,500
 but he wants to get a right relationship

281
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,760
 with the groom first and foremost,

282
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,620
 and to do it he's gonna talk to us

283
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,820
 through Matthew chapter 23.

284
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,340
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me to Matthew chapter 23.

285
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,040
 While you're turning there, we are catching up with Jesus

286
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,020
 on what's traditionally understood to be a Tuesday

287
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,460
 in the midst of the Holy Week.

288
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,220
 The Holy Week would have been the last week of his life,

289
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,120
 meaning that he's in the final two minute drill

290
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,180
 of his existence.

291
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,860
 Every play he makes, every conversation he has,

292
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,940
 everything he does, it matters a lot

293
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,060
 because there's still some work that needs to be done

294
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,900
 at this point in his life

295
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,420
 before he decides to die, rise,

296
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,260
 and ascend to the Father in heaven.

297
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,500
 And so we find him in the middle of a conversation

298
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,540
 with the religious leaders of his day.

299
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,260
 You've got issues with religious leaders in your day?

300
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,980
 Just wait till we read what we're gonna read tonight.

301
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,740
 Jesus takes a massive issue

302
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,460
 with the religious leaders of his day

303
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,060
 because in the conversation we find him,

304
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,820
 and he is going to confront all of them

305
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,640
 in the areas that they have failed miserably.

306
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,700
 And as we do, we're gonna see that he pronounces seven woes

307
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
 or seven judgments against them

308
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,280
 for the ways that they have misled the people,

309
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,980
 that they have taken the people farther

310
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,860
 from the heart of God

311
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,220
 and led them further into religiosity, empty religiosity.

312
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,740
 And as we do it, as we read these seven woes,

313
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,180
 here's what I think we're gonna try and pick up.

314
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
 I think we're going to find a series of warnings

315
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,780
 that we should pay attention to

316
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,780
 that will tell us what we should be on the lookout for,

317
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,140
 but not just warnings as well as ways

318
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,300
 that we should be looking for in ourself.

319
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,180
 So here's what it says, Matthew chapter 23,

320
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,220
 we're gonna take it verse by verse, starting in verse 13.

321
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,620
 It says, "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,

322
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,620
 "hypocrites, for you shut the kingdom of heaven

323
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,580
 "in people's faces, for you neither enter yourselves

324
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,560
 "nor allow those who would enter to go in."

325
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,540
 You see, the first thing that Jesus wants us to know

326
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,900
 is that we should beware of those

327
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,320
 who stress aptitude over attitude.

328
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,660
 We should beware of those

329
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,820
 who stress aptitude over attitude,

330
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,740
 which doesn't exactly raise any eyebrows

331
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,000
 until you realize who Jesus is speaking to in this moment.

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,740
 He is talking to the Pharisees and scribes.

333
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,580
 You see, what you need to know about the Pharisees

334
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,940
 and scribes is they are one of four religious sects

335
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,340
 in ancient Judaism that actually would have

336
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,780
 theologically aligned closest with Jesus,

337
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,760
 and most likely closest to all of us.

338
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,340
 They believe in things that we believe in,

339
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,700
 things that Jesus believes in.

340
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,500
 They believe in the resurrection from the dead,

341
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,260
 and they study the Old Testament scriptures,

342
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,360
 and they agree with the reality of a spiritual realm.

343
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,860
 They believe that God's gonna send a Messiah

344
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,340
 that's going to deliver the people of God,

345
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,660
 the nation of Israel, from their oppressors.

346
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,460
 They believe the same things we believe.

347
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,340
 They are theologically precise,

348
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,620
 so much so that they're the kind of friends

349
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,100
 you'd cheat off of in high school just to get a good grade.

350
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,220
 They knew better than you.

351
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,820
 They know better than all of us

352
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,660
 with respect to their religion,

353
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,420
 and yet what we know is that Jesus is judging them

354
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,780
 because they're shutting the door

355
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,740
 on the kingdom of heaven in people's faces.

356
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,820
 Why is he judging them?

357
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,160
 Because of that.

358
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,900
 Because while they know much about the study of God,

359
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,400
 they do not know much about the God of their study.

360
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,320
 While they know much about the doctrine of God,

361
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,820
 they don't know much about the God of their doctrine.

362
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,700
 Again, these are the spiritual leaders of the day.

363
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,020
 Like, these are the kind of people

364
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,620
 that you would've followed on social media.

365
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,960
 You would've gone to conferences to hear speak,

366
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,900
 reading their books at night.

367
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,740
 You would've tuned in to see

368
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,660
 what new insight they had to offer.

369
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,260
 You would've made sure to follow them on social media.

370
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,860
 Like, they had great things to say about who God is.

371
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,300
 They had great things to say about the word of God,

372
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,340
 and they had great things to say about the kingdom of God,

373
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,980
 and yet here's the thing we learn

374
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,500
 is though they knew who God was,

375
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,820
 they didn't recognize him when he stood face-to-face

376
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,520
 with them in the person of Christ.

377
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,440
 Though they studied the word carefully,

378
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
 they did not recognize the voice of God

379
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,160
 when he spoke to them from Jesus's own mouth.

380
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,800
 And though they anticipated the coming kingdom,

381
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,720
 they didn't receive it

382
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,340
 when Jesus actually came to bring it to them.

383
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,380
 They thought they knew so well,

384
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,340
 but what we realize is they didn't know anything at all.

385
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,180
 They had more of a relationship to religion

386
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,760
 than a relationship with God.

387
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,500
 And the consequence is they not only failed

388
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,820
 to enter the kingdom,

389
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,780
 but they kept others from entering the kingdom themselves.

390
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,220
 It's kind of like movie critics and famous films.

391
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,980
 You see, there are experts in the field of cinema

392
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,520
 that make great judgments on a variety of different options,

393
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,860
 and yet what you find is smattered

394
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,580
 throughout the history books are a variety of criticisms

395
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,720
 that are really pretty unjustified.

396
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,900
 You see, some famous critics,

397
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,100
 the experts in their industry,

398
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,820
 have looked at some of the most famous movies of all time,

399
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,740
 and they've given mixed reviews, if not scathing reviews.

400
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,740
 Movies like "Forrest Gump," "Star Wars, A New Hope,"

401
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,740
 "Casablanca," "The Wizard of Oz," and "The Sandlot."

402
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,860
 They look at these films

403
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,860
 and initially give really poor reviews upon their debut,

404
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,100
 and yet what we realize is the people

405
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,260
 that know everything about movies

406
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,280
 actually don't know anything

407
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,700
 about the most famous movies of all time.

408
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,900
 That's who the Pharisees are in this moment.

409
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,860
 You see, they misjudge Jesus completely.

410
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,980
 They write a scathing review.

411
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,560
 And sadly, because others listen to them,

412
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,260
 they cause them to miss out on the kingdom as well.

413
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,820
 Porch, it's not enough that church leaders,

414
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,040
 Christians in general, have theological proficiency.

415
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,180
 We want that, to be clear.

416
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,460
 We wanna be theologically precise.

417
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,340
 We wanna be accurate.

418
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,220
 We don't wanna have cheap grace in our services.

419
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,400
 We want to be theologically proficient,

420
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,940
 but that's just not enough.

421
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,580
 Theological proficiency is insufficient

422
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,240
 without relational proximity to God.

423
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,820
 It's one thing to love the teachings of God

424
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,380
 and the doctrine of God and the history of God

425
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,940
 and the study of God and the word of God,

426
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:22,160
 but not love the person of God himself in Jesus Christ.

427
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,100
 That makes no sense.

428
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,200
 But as Christians, we're called to look at the world

429
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,460
 and say, "Hey, I don't just have the appearance of religion.

430
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,800
 I actually demonstrate the reality of a relationship to God.

431
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,940
 You can look at me and you can see I've been marked.

432
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,780
 I've been changed.

433
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,420
 I've been transformed, not just informed,

434
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,800
 but transformed in my life."

435
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,740
 This is who Jesus is calling us to be.

436
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,840
 And yet so often Christians miss out on it.

437
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,300
 Dallas Willard said it like this

438
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,100
 in "Spirit of the Disciplines."

439
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,860
 He said, "How many people are radically and permanently

440
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,980
 repelled from the way by Christians

441
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,100
 who are unfeeling, stiff, unapproachable,

442
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,740
 boringly lifeless, obsessive, and dissatisfied?

443
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,340
 Yet such Christians are everywhere.

444
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,420
 And what they're missing is the wholesome liveliness

445
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,900
 that springs forth from a balanced vitality

446
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,600
 within the freedom of God's loving rule.

447
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,900
 Spirituality wrongly understood or pursued

448
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,220
 is a major source of human misery and rebellion against God.

449
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,060
 Some of you are miserable at the thought of God

450
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,300
 and rebelling against all his ways

451
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,340
 because you have been given a spirituality

452
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,460
 that is wrongly understood.

453
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,620
 So what does a spirituality

454
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,700
 that is rightly understood look like?"

455
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,500
 Well, Zachariah tells us.

456
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,340
 He says this.

457
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,100
 He says, "This is what the Lord of heaven's armies says.

458
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,340
 In those days, 10 men from different nations,"

459
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,880
 meaning people that do not know God,

460
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,060
 "they will clutch the sleeve of one Jew.

461
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,440
 And they will say, 'Please let us walk with you

462
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,380
 for we've heard that God is with you.'"

463
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,940
 Porch, let me ask you.

464
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,560
 Have people heard that God's with you?

465
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,100
 Or have they just heard about God from you?

466
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,020
 There's a massive difference in those two things.

467
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,340
 One is intellectually acquainted.

468
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,700
 One is intimately acquainted with Jesus.

469
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,020
 The world is wondering

470
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,420
 what is true of the Christian faith?

471
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,060
 What's characteristic of the church?

472
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,280
 And what they should see is not just knowledge,

473
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,300
 but genuine belief,

474
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,020
 not just learning, but life's meant to be lived.

475
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,180
 And thus give convincing.

476
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,060
 That's what they should see.

477
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,900
 Jesus tells us what to look out for.

478
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,480
 And then here in this moment, he's saying,

479
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,860
 "Hey, look, there's something you should look like.

480
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,380
 You should not merely look intellectually informed,

481
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,260
 but you should look intimately transformed."

482
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,900
 That's what should be true of my people.

483
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
 That's the first way that he intends us to look.

484
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,300
 The second is in verse 15.

485
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,500
 It says this, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,

486
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,980
 hypocrites, for you travel across sea and land

487
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,380
 to make a single proselyte.

488
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,540
 And when he becomes a proselyte,

489
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,940
 you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves."

490
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,980
 The second thing that Jesus warns us

491
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,380
 is that we should beware of those

492
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,740
 who convert to their cause before the kingdom.

493
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,220
 We should beware of those who convert to their cause

494
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,100
 before the kingdom, because according to Jesus,

495
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,680
 leaders can not only dissuade you

496
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,700
 from believing the right things,

497
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,620
 they can persuade you to believe the wrong things.

498
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,900
 That's what the Pharisees and scribes

499
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,100
 are doing in this moment.

500
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,340
 Like when Jesus says, when he uses the word proselyte,

501
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,140
 that's just another word for convert.

502
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,380
 It's to take somebody that believes one thing

503
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,640
 and lead them to believe something different.

504
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,060
 Instead, and this was actually a really important thing

505
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,780
 to the nation of Israel, because God had called them

506
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,580
 in the Old Testament to be a light to the nations.

507
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,060
 Like they were meant to present a convincing case

508
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,480
 to the watching world that God is true

509
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 and he is worthy of walking with.

510
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,140
 And so the Pharisees and scribes,

511
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,700
 they're living into this command.

512
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,380
 They know this is what's meant to be true of us.

513
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,980
 And yet they give a different kind of light

514
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,820
 than the light that God intends us to give.

515
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,340
 You see, the kind of light we should give to the world

516
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,280
 is sort of like a space heater.

517
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,360
 What's a space heater do?

518
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,500
 When you see it, you move out from the cold

519
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,980
 and into the warmth.

520
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,660
 And as you spend time in the presence of that space heater,

521
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,380
 near that light, you feel good.

522
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,980
 It takes away the chill.

523
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,980
 It dusts off the cold and it comforts you in its company.

524
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,740
 That's what the people of God are meant to be like.

525
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,820
 And yet the Pharisees and scribes,

526
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,540
 they're not really a space heater.

527
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,740
 They're more of a bug zapper.

528
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,180
 They have a magnetizing effect.

529
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,060
 They're drawing people in.

530
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,460
 And yet the closer you get,

531
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,300
 like you get, you get not life, you get death.

532
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,120
 Like you get electrocuted.

533
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,700
 Like you find out this is not actually going to lead

534
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,540
 to my flourishing.

535
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,260
 This is going to lead to my perishing.

536
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,540
 That's what we find with these Pharisees.

537
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,600
 They have a similar magnetizing effect.

538
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,100
 And yet their light leads to death,

539
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,740
 not life like God intended.

540
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,360
 That's what Jesus is getting at in this verse.

541
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,540
 He's telling the Pharisees that rather than convert people

542
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,260
 to the kingdom, what they have chosen to do

543
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,780
 is they have chosen to convert them to their cause.

544
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,180
 So what's the cause that he's converting them to?

545
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,380
 The cause of the Pharisees and scribes

546
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,500
 are trying to convert people to

547
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,660
 was a set of oral tradition.

548
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,580
 They had developed over 1500 commands

549
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,380
 known as fence laws that surrounded God's own mosaic law

550
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,880
 to protect people from actually doing

551
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,800
 what they shouldn't do.

552
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,360
 It was a preventative measure.

553
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,600
 And yet it was so cumbersome.

554
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,560
 Like while the idea seemed to make a lot of sense,

555
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,960
 what we realize is it actually perpetuated

556
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
 something really damaging.

557
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,260
 It led people to think that they could actually

558
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,720
 make themselves righteous through manmade legalism.

559
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,160
 And if not that, it would dissuade people

560
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,960
 from going all in with Jesus and following after God

561
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,200
 and instead indulging whatever it is they wanted

562
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,260
 in their selfishness.

563
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,940
 It had a repulsive effect.

564
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,620
 And it damaged people in ways it never meant to happen.

565
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,140
 You see, we may not adhere to the oral traditions

566
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,900
 of the Pharisees, but many Christians nonetheless

567
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,320
 advocate personal projects or social causes

568
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,580
 that are similarly damaging.

569
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,940
 And some of you have lived through that.

570
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,660
 Like whether it's seeing your church compel people

571
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,180
 to vote a certain way or watching a religious system

572
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
 perpetuate poverty and racism or sexual abuse

573
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,540
 or seeing Christians tolerate brokenness and sin

574
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,980
 out of a desire to love other people

575
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,180
 or advocating social reform at the expense

576
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,580
 of biblical truth, religious people and leaders

577
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,540
 most of all frequently convert people to their cause

578
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,300
 and not to Christ's kingdom.

579
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:00,140
 We're not called to convince people

580
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,460
 of the merits of our passion points.

581
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,140
 We're meant to convince people

582
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,500
 of the passionate pursuit of Christ for them.

583
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,260
 That's what we're called to do.

584
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,660
 So many people are disillusioned with what we believe

585
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,340
 as the people of God because we have given them

586
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,300
 poor reason to follow him and a reason that God

587
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,600
 never intended to be offered in the first place.

588
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,980
 No, everything the world is looking for,

589
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,060
 everything many of you are looking for,

590
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,260
 freedom and fullness and purpose and love

591
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,260
 and acceptance and community and a deep sense

592
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,260
 of abiding joy, all of that is actually found in God.

593
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,820
 It's not found anywhere else.

594
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,100
 It's not going to be achieved through some other cause.

595
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,300
 It's going to be found in Christ.

596
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,460
 And the amazing thing is while none of us

597
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,700
 could actually receive that on our own,

598
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,200
 he came to bring that and give it to you as a gift.

599
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,300
 If you'd step into relationship with him

600
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,820
 and walk with him today, tomorrow and the rest of your life,

601
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,920
 this is what's available.

602
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,460
 There's a beauty to the character of God

603
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,740
 that affords for us all the luxury we want in life.

604
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,820
 Not material luxury, but intrinsic luxury,

605
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,500
 a luxury that's characteristic of heaven and not earth.

606
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,140
 That's what he comes to give.

607
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:25,180
 And yet many of us, we look to some sort of earthly

608
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,900
 social cause to achieve that end instead.

609
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,640
 Jesus comes to rescue us from that.

610
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,540
 You see, the second way he intends his people to look

611
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,340
 is he intends for us to look as a people

612
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,220
 passionate for the kingdom

613
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,700
 and not just passionate for our causes.

614
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,540
 But he doesn't stop there.

615
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,360
 He keeps going.

616
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,980
 He says this in verse 16, he says,

617
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,720
 "Woe to you, blind guides who say

618
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,040
 "if anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing.

619
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,820
 "But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple,

620
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,740
 "he's bound by his oath.

621
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,860
 "You blind fools, like for which is greater,

622
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,200
 "the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?

623
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,740
 "And you say, if anyone swears by the altar, it's nothing.

624
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,580
 "But if anyone swears by the gift that's on the altar,

625
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,900
 "he's bound by his oath.

626
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,560
 "You blind men, for which is greater,

627
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,460
 "the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

628
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,240
 "So whoever swears by the altar,

629
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,180
 "swears by it and by everything on it.

630
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
 "And whoever swears by the temple,

631
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,020
 "swears by it and by him who dwells in it.

632
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
 "And whoever swears by heaven,

633
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,500
 "swears by the throne of God

634
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,700
 "and by him who sits upon it."

635
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,660
 The third thing that Jesus is warning us tonight

636
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,180
 is that we should beware of those

637
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,580
 who leverage authority to escape accountability.

638
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,580
 We should beware of those who leverage authority

639
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,500
 to escape accountability.

640
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,420
 Now at first, this woe can seem pretty confusing

641
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,200
 because things like swearing on the altar

642
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,820
 versus a swing on the gift on the altar,

643
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,700
 swearing on the temple versus

644
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
 swearing on the gold of the temple

645
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,940
 seems pretty irrelevant to our day and age.

646
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,540
 And yet it would have been totally commonplace

647
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,060
 for the people that Jesus is speaking to in this moment,

648
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,200
 not just the crowds,

649
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,240
 but particularly the Pharisees and the scribes.

650
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,540
 You see, what they would do

651
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,380
 is they would often make a binding oath.

652
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,780
 They would commit by way of their word,

653
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,420
 by swearing to something of special significance.

654
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,980
 It would intensify and legitimize the fact

655
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,220
 that they really meant what they were saying.

656
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,660
 We do this today in a similar modern equivalent

657
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,260
 when we're sworn in for testimony at court.

658
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,860
 What do you do?

659
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,740
 You place your hand on the Bible,

660
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,080
 something significant,

661
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,140
 and you swear to tell the whole truth

662
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,980
 or the truth, the whole truth,

663
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,820
 and nothing but the truth.

664
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,460
 So help you God, right?

665
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,900
 That's what we do today.

666
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,820
 We do something similar.

667
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,180
 We commit our way and we legitimize our word

668
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,940
 and our vow and our oath

669
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,820
 by swearing upon something significant.

670
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,700
 That's what they're doing.

671
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,980
 That's what Jesus is referencing in this moment.

672
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,060
 And yet what we realize is the Pharisees,

673
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,140
 they're not just giving their word.

674
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,380
 They're actually creating a loophole

675
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,620
 to get out of whatever their commitment may be.

676
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,360
 So the way it works is they would swear

677
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,980
 to something of significance.

678
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,140
 And yet if they decided that a better offer came

679
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,420
 or they wanted to get out of their binding oath,

680
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,180
 they would swear to something of even greater significance.

681
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,900
 And because it's more significant,

682
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,160
 this previous oath is invalidated.

683
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,940
 And now I have a new commitment.

684
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,260
 And yet Jesus is looking at him.

685
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,400
 He's saying, no, let your yes be yes.

686
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,140
 Let your no be no.

687
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,240
 Like God is faithful.

688
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,420
 And so we should be too.

689
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,980
 Like we don't have to base our integrity

690
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,260
 upon something of significance

691
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,580
 when all the significance we need is found

692
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,600
 in the fact that we're made in God's image.

693
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,020
 As he is, so we too should be.

694
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,620
 And yet what we know is just as the religious leaders

695
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,820
 of Jesus' day used their authority to escape accountability,

696
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,220
 Christians do this today.

697
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,820
 We've all seen it, particularly a lot in the last decade.

698
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,300
 Leaders covering up some kind of scandal,

699
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,220
 pushing away some sort of habitual sin,

700
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,280
 doing their best to control a narrative

701
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,140
 or blame shift some accusation

702
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,400
 that they don't have to take accountability for.

703
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,940
 And yet what we know is this is not the way of Jesus.

704
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,300
 Psalm 15, one, two, it says,

705
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,460
 oh Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent?

706
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,660
 Who shall dwell on your holy hill?

707
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,700
 Is he who walks blamelessly and does what is right

708
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,980
 and speaks truth in his heart.

709
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,180
 And then you jump to verse four,

710
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,740
 it says who swears to his own hurt and does not change,

711
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,540
 who gives his word, who gives her word.

712
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,220
 And even when the going gets tough

713
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,700
 and this becomes really inconvenient,

714
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,500
 they don't bend, they don't break, they don't flake.

715
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,480
 So I remember when I worked in college ministry,

716
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,800
 I would meet students all the time

717
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,300
 that were so excited to hop in

718
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,140
 with the things we were doing.

719
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,340
 Like they would learn about the ministry

720
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,460
 and the opportunities they're in,

721
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,620
 and they would apply and come to orientation

722
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,060
 and learn all of our expectations

723
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,820
 and be super geared up until a better offer would come.

724
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,900
 And then as they proceeded to try and flake out,

725
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,180
 there would be a series of conversations

726
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,140
 we would have with one another

727
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,420
 that always went one of two ways.

728
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,980
 They would come to me and they would say,

729
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,060
 Kylan, I've really been praying about it.

730
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,980
 And I just think God's calling me to this.

731
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,660
 Or they would come to me and say,

732
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,060
 Kylan, I've really been praying about it.

733
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,860
 I think God is telling me to do that.

734
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,860
 And I, with love in my heart and kindness in my eyes,

735
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,980
 would graciously tell them they're wrong.

736
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:42,540
 Because God will not say something now

737
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,660
 that disagrees with something he said then.

738
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,180
 He tells us when you make your commitment,

739
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,860
 you hold fast to it.

740
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,940
 When you say yes, you let it be yes.

741
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,580
 You keep your oath, even to your own hurt.

742
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,420
 We should be faithful, 'cause he's faithful.

743
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,820
 Like God has never not kept his word, has he?

744
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,100
 He's always kept his word.

745
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,500
 He's never covered up some kind of evil, has he?

746
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,660
 No, he exposes it.

747
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,340
 He's never kind of snuck out of a commitment

748
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,300
 that he had at some point in the past.

749
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,500
 No, he honors it, he keeps it.

750
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,980
 This is who our God is,

751
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,460
 and this is who the people of God should be.

752
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,700
 And yet so many of us, we become just disenchanted,

753
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,900
 disoriented, disappointed by the fact that,

754
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,220
 man, the Christians I know and the leaders

755
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,300
 of God's people don't look like this.

756
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,720
 They sneak around.

757
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,120
 They act more faithlessly than faithfully.

758
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,620
 They do what they know they should not,

759
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,340
 and yet they don't own up to it.

760
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,560
 They don't take accountability.

761
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,380
 Jesus is looking at us, he's saying,

762
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,040
 "Don't let this be true of you.

763
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,980
 "This is not the way of God, nor is it the way of my people."

764
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,180
 No, we're meant to walk in transparency.

765
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,700
 Like we don't hide aspects of who we are.

766
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,980
 We walk in the freedom that the gospel has afforded.

767
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,160
 Like we walk in transparency,

768
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,560
 but we also, we express authenticity.

769
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,140
 Like we say what we mean, and we mean what we say,

770
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,700
 but we don't just do that, we also embrace accountability.

771
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,500
 Like we bring people into our lives,

772
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 and we give them permission to hold us accountable,

773
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,580
 to keep us to task, to make sure we're honest,

774
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,820
 to help us remain reliable.

775
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,840
 Like this is what we do.

776
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,300
 We try to walk in transparency, express authenticity,

777
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,660
 embrace accountability,

778
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,780
 because this is what Jesus intends for his people.

779
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,160
 He wants us to be knowable, not hidden.

780
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:55,580
 The last thing that he warns us is found in verse 23.

781
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,260
 It says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,

782
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,380
 "hypocrites, for you tithe mint and dill and cumin,

783
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,200
 "and have neglected the weightier matters of the law,

784
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,140
 "justice and mercy and faithfulness.

785
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,460
 "These you ought to have done

786
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,900
 "without neglecting the others,

787
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,840
 "you blind guides, straining on a gnat,

788
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,220
 "and swallowing a camel."

789
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,940
 What the heck is he talking about?

790
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,140
 [congregation laughing]

791
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,580
 What's the last thing that he wants us to know?

792
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
 That we should be aware of those

793
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,980
 who emphasize small matters over big matters.

794
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,180
 Should be aware of those who emphasize small matters

795
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
 over big matters.

796
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,240
 You see, Jesus' criticism here is not

797
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,320
 that the Pharisees and scribes have tithe,

798
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,660
 dill, cumin, and mint.

799
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,300
 He's not getting onto them for doing that.

800
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,540
 He's not belittling their observance

801
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,300
 and obedience to the law.

802
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,860
 What he's doing is he's bemoaning the fact

803
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,860
 that they have honored the smallest of things,

804
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,580
 and yet they have dishonored the weightiest of things.

805
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,180
 They pay attention to the things

806
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:03,020
 that are so individually insignificant,

807
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,580
 and in light of doing that,

808
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,740
 they have missed out on what is

809
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,820
 eternally significant instead.

810
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,260
 He's not getting onto them because they're doing

811
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,660
 what the Old Testament requires.

812
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,740
 They're giving a tenth of what they have to God,

813
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,560
 even to the degree of measuring out

814
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,140
 the smallest garden crop possible.

815
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,300
 He's not getting onto them for that.

816
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,620
 He's getting onto them

817
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,820
 because they've forgotten the important things,

818
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,060
 things that today, here in our world,

819
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,380
 we too as Christians have forgotten ourselves.

820
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,180
 How much of our witness has the church lost

821
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,220
 because it's focused on immaterial,

822
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,180
 meaningless, and irrelevant matters

823
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,720
 while the world is burning around us?

824
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,020
 Like, I'm not trying to shame anybody here,

825
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,020
 and I am certainly not trying to make myself

826
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,820
 the moral example to follow.

827
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,300
 I have plenty of room to grow in this too,

828
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,320
 and yet it looks odd to the watching world

829
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,780
 when we disagree over doctrinal distinctions

830
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,620
 and denominational differences

831
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,240
 while there are refugee crises

832
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,120
 in places like Syria and Ukraine.

833
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,500
 It looks odd to the world when they watch us

834
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,500
 squabble over social causes of insignificant matter

835
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,940
 when they know we're called to love the widow

836
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,100
 and the orphan instead.

837
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:33,140
 It's odd to the world that we would follow God's allegiance

838
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,640
 less so than the allegiance we hold

839
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,000
 to some political party or social issue.

840
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,920
 It's confusing.

841
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,700
 It doesn't make sense.

842
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,000
 Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that we shouldn't wrestle

843
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,540
 for theological precision

844
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,480
 and advocate for objective morality in life

845
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,520
 or pursue kingdom values for our country.

846
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,320
 We should do all of those things, but here's the thing.

847
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,680
 When Christians lose their minds over small things,

848
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,060
 the world loses its faith over big things.

849
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,000
 When we lose our mind over small things,

850
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,520
 the world loses its faith over big things.

851
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,360
 Woe to us if we strain out the gnat

852
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,360
 and yet we swallow the camel.

853
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,240
 What's Jesus saying there?

854
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,120
 He's saying, "Woe to you, ugh,

855
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,800
 "if you choose to be clean in the smallest of matters

856
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,060
 "and yet you allow yourself to be unclean

857
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,280
 "in the areas of life that matter most,

858
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,080
 "which are justice, mercy, and faithfulness."

859
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,200
 The prophet Amos recounts it like this from God.

860
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,820
 It says, "I hate, I despise your feasts.

861
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,860
 "I can't stand the stench of your solemn assemblies.

862
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,360
 "Even if you offer me your burnt offerings

863
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,560
 "and grain offerings, I will not accept them.

864
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,760
 "I will have no regard for your fellowship offerings

865
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,420
 "of fattened cattle.

866
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,300
 "Take away from me the noise of your songs.

867
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,740
 "I will not listen to the music of your harps,

868
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,740
 "but let justice flow like water

869
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,960
 "and righteousness like an unfailing stream."

870
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,800
 What good is our religiosity

871
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,040
 if we forget God's priority porch?

872
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,760
 What good is it if we're so focused

873
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
 on the things that matter to us

874
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,600
 that we forget the things that matter most to God?

875
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,500
 What does God care most about?

876
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,600
 He cares most about people,

877
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,980
 that which will never perish,

878
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,080
 that which will go on for eternity.

879
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,960
 Everything in this room, all the material in your life,

880
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,840
 the things of this earth, they will fade and grow to dust,

881
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,580
 except for the people next to you.

882
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,840
 God cares about people.

883
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,720
 That's why he calls us to justice and mercy and faithfulness.

884
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,000
 Like he cares about justice,

885
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,160
 about righting the wrongs

886
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,080
 that have been afflicted against people.

887
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,960
 He cares about mercy,

888
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,040
 about lavishing love where those cry the loudest.

889
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,780
 He cares about faithfulness,

890
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,200
 about leading people to truth,

891
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,680
 that he wants a relationship with them

892
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,520
 so much so that he would have great compassion

893
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,200
 to race towards them wherever it is they are.

894
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,320
 This is what he cares about.

895
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,280
 And it's what we should care about too.

896
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,680
 We should be purposeful of what's important

897
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,060
 and not neglectful of it.

898
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,120
 The last thing that Jesus cares to see.

899
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,580
 You know, when Brooke and I were sitting

900
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,820
 in the middle of Belize,

901
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:44,640
 on the curbside, right next to Captain Tom

902
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
 in his suspect van,

903
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,420
 (congregation laughing)

904
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:56,080
 I was so convinced there was no way

905
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,000
 we were going on this ride.

906
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 I thought the whole thing was a farce.

907
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,300
 I felt totally betrayed by the fact

908
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,440
 that we were showing up for one thing,

909
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,480
 but we got something else entirely.

910
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,860
 And I was out.

911
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,120
 I was ready to walk away.

912
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,640
 I was ready to swim back to the ship

913
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,420
 if that's what it took for me to get as far away

914
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,840
 from this situation as possible.

915
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,960
 That is until a fellow traveler walked up.

916
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,360
 Someone that had a similar credential

917
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,660
 from the same cruise that we had come from.

918
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,200
 And he looked at us in the midst

919
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,100
 of our uncertain situation,

920
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,540
 in the face of the distrust we were feeling.

921
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,540
 And he assured us, hey, this may all look pretty odd.

922
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,760
 It may even feel untrustworthy,

923
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,100
 but what you need to know is the journey's worth it.

924
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,200
 The adventure ahead is everything you hope.

925
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,260
 And you don't have to go there alone.

926
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,600
 I've been there before.

927
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,000
 You can trust me, even if you don't trust this,

928
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,460
 and we can go there together.

929
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,920
 So we did.

930
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,540
 And we had an amazing time.

931
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,680
 It was an experience we speak about to this day.

932
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,040
 Not because the circumstances around

933
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,760
 or the situation itself seemed trustworthy,

934
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,120
 but because someone showed up who we could trust in

935
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,880
 that had been where we were

936
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,440
 and had gone where we were going.

937
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,000
 If you're here and

938
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,880
 you feel religiously ridiculed, spiritually traumatized,

939
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,240
 then what you need to know is

940
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880
 Jesus is not asking anything of you

941
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,480
 that he has not done so himself.

942
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,800
 You see, you may be here and you're like,

943
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,640
 man, I feel so betrayed.

944
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,720
 Like everyone I trusted,

945
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,960
 like they ruined everything for me.

946
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
 I thought this was one thing

947
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
 and it ended up being something else.

948
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,880
 And they showed up to be the most untrustworthy

949
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,140
 and unlikely of people.

950
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,560
 I feel betrayed and Jesus looks at you and goes,

951
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,400
 I get it.

952
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,760
 I was betrayed too.

953
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,800
 Not just by those I trusted,

954
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,660
 but by those who trusted in me.

955
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,200
 They were the ones that sold me out.

956
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,160
 They were the ones who changed my situation.

957
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,200
 They were the ones

958
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,780
 that left me broken.

959
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,840
 Some of you were here and you feel like,

960
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,180
 man, I'm so hurt.

961
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,840
 Like I was taken to places and brought to points

962
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,120
 that I never thought I would be at.

963
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,040
 And yet Jesus looks at you and goes,

964
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,400
 hey, I've been hurt too.

965
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,320
 I've been hurt by the religious,

966
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,840
 the spiritual, the leaders.

967
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,200
 I've been hurt, not just at some point in the past,

968
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,400
 I have been hurt even to the point of death.

969
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,920
 And some of you are here and all you see in your story

970
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,120
 are religious scars.

971
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,080
 And yet Jesus comes to you and he says,

972
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,440
 I have those too.

973
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,280
 For these scars,

974
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,840
 for the price of a people such as you.

975
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,160
 If you're here and you're religiously wounded,

976
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,960
 then know this,

977
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,760
 Jesus heals our religious wounds by his wounds himself.

978
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,160
 And he wants to do it with you tonight.

979
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,600
 So let me pray that he would.

980
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,680
 God, I'm grateful.

981
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,840
 When we've all but given up,

982
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,520
 when we feel totally betrayed and we're ready to walk away,

983
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,240
 you chase us down.

984
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,560
 When we feel hurt, you bring healing.

985
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,680
 When we feel wronged, you come to make it right.

986
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,040
 This is your heart, God.

987
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,000
 And it's a heart that God, we want to be reacquainted with

988
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,360
 if we have grown distant from it at any time in the past.

989
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,200
 So God, I pray that you would do it here tonight.

990
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,680
 I pray that you would do it right now in this moment.

991
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,360
 I thank God about the opportunity for healing in this place.

992
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,920
 And I'm asking you, God, please, would you do that?

993
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,000
 Would you provide a healing balm

994
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,120
 to the broken parts of our lives?

995
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,840
 Would you lead us, God, back to a place

996
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,840
 where we have restored relationship in you

997
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,000
 and a restored relationship to your people?

998
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,240
 We love you, God.

999
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,640
 And we want to deal with you now.

1000
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,320
 It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

1001
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,560
 Hey, porch, let's stand to our feet real fast.

1002
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,480
 Hey, one thing that I realized

1003
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,280
 as I was making my way through that sermon

1004
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,600
 is there was no way we were gonna get through

1005
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,960
 all seven woes, and so we took four tonight.

1006
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,480
 We'll clean up the last three

1007
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,160
 the next time we are all together.

1008
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,320
 I think this is a topic

1009
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,520
 that deserves a little bit more time anyways.

1010
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,400
 Some of you are really wrestling

1011
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,800
 with some of the ideas we've spoken about tonight,

1012
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,480
 some things that resonated with you,

1013
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,120
 and yet you're not real sure how to process them.

1014
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,960
 What we wanna encourage you to do is,

1015
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,760
 is to wrestle well,

1016
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,840
 which often means you don't wrestle alone.

1017
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,120
 Maybe a conversation, an internal dialogue

1018
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,560
 has stirred up within that you need to get out.

1019
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
 We've got a team down here to the front,

1020
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,480
 my right and my left, that would love to process with you.

1021
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,840
 You will not tell us something that we haven't heard before.

1022
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,680
 You will not tell us anything that we haven't heard.

1023
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,440
 Anything that catches us off guard.

1024
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,600
 But this is an opportunity for healing,

1025
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,400
 and so we wanna give you a place

1026
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,480
 where you can do that at whatever pace

1027
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,400
 feels most helpful as we sing together.

1028
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,920
 So let's do that together now.

1029
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:58,920
