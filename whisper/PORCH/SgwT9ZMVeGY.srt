1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:20,320
 - All right, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,160
 Welcome to my friends tuning in online

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,500
 at our Porch Live locations.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
 We have tonight Porch Live, Des Moines, Porch, Boise, Idaho,

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,800
 and Porch H-Town, Houston, Texas.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,160
 And of course my friends in the room in Dallas tonight,

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,300
 welcome to the Porch.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,720
 We are taking a break from any series tonight

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,940
 and you guys got me in a one-off message.

12
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,440
 But before we get to that, if y'all don't know,

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,160
 when I teach, David usually takes the night off

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,680
 to be with his family and his kids.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,640
 He's up here every Tuesday.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
 And so he takes that time or tonight,

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,600
 like tonight, he's speaking at a youth camp

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
 and he always, every single time,

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
 and he loves the Porch so much,

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,280
 he gets up on Wednesday and he watches the message.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,080
 And so he's listening right now

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,920
 and he's probably surprised

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,400
 that I'm talking about him right now.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
 And I'm talking behind his back

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,360
 because he would never ask me to do this,

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,080
 but I wanna celebrate DMARF tonight

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,820
 and I wanna honor that man because, wait, wait,

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,360
 we have a few things to celebrate.

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,960
 Number one, I don't know if you know this,

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,800
 but tonight, and if you don't know,

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,000
 David Marvin is the director here at the Porch, okay?

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,440
 I'm like the second at bat and he's the home run, okay?

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,760
 And so David has been leading and serving here

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,280
 at the Porch for 12 years today.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 (congregation cheering)

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,400
 And so, I mean, David, thank you.

37
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,520
 Thank you for neglecting hobbies and family

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,440
 and so many different things.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,280
 I mean, you love your family,

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,280
 but sometimes you need to be here and different things.

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,320
 So you can pour into the young adults of this generation

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,720
 and we take that serious and we have so much gratitude.

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,160
 The second thing I want to bring to your attention

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,460
 is our fearless leader, David Marvin,

45
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,200
 is about to be an author.

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,200
 And he is releasing his first book called, drum roll,

47
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,640
 "We're All Freaking Out and Why We Don't Need To."

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
 And this book is all about the topic of anxiety

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
 and mental health and depression

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
 and how it has just plagued our generation

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
 and how we as Christians are meant to be called

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,440
 to have a life marked by peace.

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,460
 And he takes this book

54
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,720
 and he gives us practical wisdom principles

55
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,280
 founded in God's word of how we can fight anxiety,

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,560
 fight depression.

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,240
 And so tonight, and for those listening exclusively,

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,320
 you get a special thing where you get to,

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,920
 next slide, please.

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,400

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,640

 and make sure that you claim yours.

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,720
 And guys, David, I'm telling you,

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,400
 we believe in this resource.

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,520
 He spent hours and hours writing this book

66
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,920
 because he believes in you guys.

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,480
 And so we believe in it.

68
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,160
 So pre-order, can all of you get it?

69
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
 Is it reaching up there?

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
 Good, it's up there, you good?

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,480
 Balcony, I love the balcony.

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
 You guys don't get enough love up there.

73
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,640
 You guys rock.

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,660
 So use that.

75
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
 I want to keep it up long enough.

76
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,000
 I think we're good.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,520
 But pre-order, it'll also be up on his Instagram,

78
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,440
 I'm pretty sure.

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
 But pre-order, we're all freaking out today.

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,560
 DMARV, we love you, we honor you, and we're so thankful.

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,200
 Can y'all give it up for David one more time?

82
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,680
 (audience cheering)

83
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,560
 I'm so excited to watch how this book

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
 just impacts people all over the world.

85
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,000
 And where that book is the perfect setup

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,700
 because where that book is all about the battle of the mind,

87
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,880
 tonight, when David allows me to do this one-off messages,

88
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,720
 he pretty much just says,

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,560
 "Hey, what has God just been putting on your heart recently?

90
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
 "Like, what are you excited about?

91
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,100
 "What just pours out of you?

92
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,880
 "What makes you come alive?"

93
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,400
 And tonight, I'm talking about not just the battle

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,120
 of the mind, but the battle that you and I

95
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,520
 and every single one of us are in.

96
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,160
 I want to talk about something I'm very passionate about,

97
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,800
 and it's the topic of spiritual warfare.

98
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,080
 Spiritual warfare.

99
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
 And some of you might not know what that means.

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,240
 Spiritual warfare, basically, if you look in books

101
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,380
 in the Bible, like Ezekiel and Isaiah and Revelation,

102
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,200
 in those books, we learn kind of like

103
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,640
 in the beginning of the world,

104
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,960
 God created the heavens and the earth,

105
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,640
 and he filled the heavens with angels

106
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,120
 that were supposed to bring him glory.

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,080
 But there was one angel that was known as Lucifer.

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
 We now know him as Satan.

109
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,960
 He was actually described as the most beautiful

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
 of all the angels.

111
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,280
 And because of that, he let his pride get to him.

112
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,320
 And he wanted to elevate himself over God.

113
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,160
 He wanted to be like God.

114
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,360
 And so because of that, God said, "I had enough."

115
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,240
 He casted him down.

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,700
 And there was about a third of the angels

117
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,200
 that who we now call Satan took with him.

118
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,840
 And they're what we refer to as demons.

119
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,960
 And the Bible talks about,

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,240
 whether you're aware of this or not,

121
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,200
 that you and I, every single day, are in a war.

122
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,760
 We are in a battle that we call spiritual warfare,

123
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,120
 that there is this spiritual realm all around us

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,880
 that if right now I could ask God, please don't, God,

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,940
 but to reveal to us the war going on,

126
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,240
 I mean, we would just head running for the hills.

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,420
 Because the reality is, is there is an enemy.

128
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,560
 And his name is Satan.

129
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,780
 And every single day, he has a mission.

130
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,200
 And I am passionate about my friends and my generation

131
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,440
 knowing about what he's setting out to accomplish.

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,360
 And I'm even more passionate about them knowing

133
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,360
 what God wants to accomplish through them in light of that.

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,920
 And so that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.

135
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
 And we're gonna do that by looking at

136
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,340
 the book of Ephesians chapter six,

137
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,760
 if you wanna turn there.

138
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,600
 I'm gonna read the entire passage.

139
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,120
 I'm gonna pray for us.

140
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,400
 And we're gonna get started and see what Paul has to say

141
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,520
 about this topic of spiritual warfare,

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,680
 writing to the church of Ephesus as he is imprisoned,

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
 shackled in chains to a Roman soldier in Rome.

144
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
 It's powerful stuff.

145
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,000
 And I wanna say this right now.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,840
 Satan hates this message.

147
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,560
 He doesn't want this message to take place tonight

148
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,360
 because his greatest weapon

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,200
 is your lack of awareness that he exists.

150
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,000
 There's a quote, as I was studying from John Nicola

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,440
 that says, "The devil's greatest asset

152
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,160
 is the doubt people have about his existence."

153
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,120
 The devil's greatest asset is the doubt

154
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,040
 that people have about his existence.

155
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,440
 And so he will do anything in this moment

156
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,600
 to distract you, to have someone text you,

157
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,080
 to have thoughts from your day,

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,560
 that crazy hectic day you had crossed your mind.

159
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,920
 He wants to do anything he can in this moment

160
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,720
 to keep you from hearing this message tonight.

161
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,000
 And so I ask you to pay attention

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
 and let's learn from Paul in Ephesians chapter six.

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,280
 So here we go, verse 10.

164
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
 "Finally, be strong in the Lord

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,040
 and in the strength of his might,

166
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,360
 put on the whole armor of God

167
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,280
 that you may be able to stand

168
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,480
 against the schemes of the devil.

169
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,900
 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,

170
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,620
 but against the rulers, against the authorities,

171
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,320
 against the cosmic powers over the present darkness,

172
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,880
 against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.

173
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,960
 Therefore, take up the whole armor of God

174
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,240
 that you may be able to withstand in the evil day.

175
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,240
 And having done all to stand firm,

176
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,640
 stand therefore having fastened on the belt of truth

177
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,080
 and having put on the breastplate of righteousness

178
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
 and as shoes for your feet,

179
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,880
 having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace,

180
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,200
 in all circumstances, take up the shield of faith

181
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,680
 with which you can extinguish

182
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,040
 all the flaming darts of the evil one.

183
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,760
 And take the helmet of salvation

184
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,220
 and the sword of the spirit,

185
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,640
 which is the word of God,

186
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,940
 praying at all times in the spirit.

187
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,360
 With all prayer and supplication to that end,

188
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,640
 keep alert with all perseverance,

189
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,960
 making supplication for all the saints.

190
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,320
 Tonight, I'm gonna call this message,

191
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,920
 "This is How We Fight Our Battles"

192
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,960
 with this scripture right here, but let me pray first.

193
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
 Father, I ask right now in the name of Jesus,

194
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,780
 in his mighty and matchless name,

195
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,880
 that you would push out any force of evil

196
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,840
 that would wanna hinder this message.

197
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,200
 I pray right now, Jesus,

198
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,080
 that you would come and you would move in our hearts.

199
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,440
 Holy Spirit, would you come and have your way

200
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
 on your sons and daughters?

201
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
 I pray that there are scales covering eyes tonight

202
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
 that they would fall off right now.

203
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
 If there are things plugging the ears

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,200
 to keep people from hearing of your love and goodness,

205
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,000
 would you remove it?

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,780
 If there's any distractions, would you take it away?

207
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,720
 We invite you, Holy Spirit, and in your power

208
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,840
 and in your authority to come and speak.

209
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,880
 If there's anything that's not of you tonight,

210
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,780
 would you get rid of it?

211
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,000
 Would you be glorified?

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,280
 It's your name that I pray, amen.

213
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,280
 I remember I was in sixth grade

214
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,120
 and my dad took me and some guys to this ranch out in,

215
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,200
 what's it called?

216
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,720
 Talco, Texas, the middle of nowhere.

217
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,880
 I don't even know where it's at in the map, honestly.

218
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,600
 And we are in these woods and he took me hunting.

219
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,440
 We went hunting.

220
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,540
 Normally when you go hunting in the evening,

221
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,080
 you hunt until literally you can't see anything.

222
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
 And then in the dark of the night,

223
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
 it's just absolutely terrifying,

224
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,840
 especially when you're like sixth grade,

225
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,820
 you walk back to your truck.

226
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,560
 And so as normal, I've been hunting a few times with my dad

227
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,120
 but I'd never been hunting in this place, Talco, Texas.

228
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,760
 I'd never been hunting on this ranch.

229
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,800
 And so I wasn't really aware of my surroundings.

230
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,860
 I didn't really know what's going on,

231
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,960
 but I just know that my dad knew the way to the truck.

232
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
 So I'm trusting him and I'm walking

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,760
 and I'm stepping on leaves and I'm being all loud.

234
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,840
 I'm not caring about anything.

235
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,840
 And eventually I hear out of nowhere, this piercing,

236
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,960
 I'm talking piercing,

237
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,760
 what sounds like a scream from a woman near me.

238
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,780
 And I'm like, "Oh."

239
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,680
 And like, you know, like Shaggy,

240
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,480
 when he jumps in like Scooby-Doo's arms,

241
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,920
 that's what I did to my dad.

242
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,240
 And I'm like, "What was that?"

243
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,080
 And I'm thinking like,

244
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
 he's gonna tell me some lady or whatever.

245
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
 And he looks at me and he tells me,

246
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,040
 "I don't wanna freak you out,

247
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,920
 but on this property,

248
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,160
 they have told us that there are mountain lions

249
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,560
 and they scream."

250
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,200
 And I'm like, "We got screaming mountain lions in this mug?

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 Like, what are you talking about?"

252
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,720
 And I was like, "They climbed trees.

253
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,200
 They got night vision."

254
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,720
 And suddenly, boom,

255
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
 everything about my pursuit to the truck changed.

256
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,200
 I was walking faster.

257
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
 I was more aware.

258
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
 I was more alert.

259
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
 You got my 20?

260
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
 I'm like looking around,

261
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
 like, I mean, I am looking everywhere, searching.

262
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,440
 And I start there because once my dad made me aware

263
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,740
 that there was a prowling enemy around,

264
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,160
 everything changed about my journey.

265
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,840
 I'm talking, I became more alert.

266
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,640
 I start looking for him.

267
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,640
 My awareness changed my journey in radical ways.

268
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,440
 And I start there because like I said earlier,

269
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,560
 I think so many of us go about our day today

270
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,980
 and we are unaware that we are in a war.

271
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,940
 We don't really care that we are on the battlefield.

272
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,320
 We don't really even know about our enemy.

273
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,740
 And because of that, we are susceptible to his attacks.

274
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,320
 We are susceptible to when he lies to us.

275
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,040
 And you've been searching and longing

276
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
 and looking and desperate,

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,140
 and you haven't found life

278
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,580
 and you have experienced true life

279
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,400
 because you haven't even known

280
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,040
 that someone's taking it from you.

281
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,480
 And so tonight, we're gonna just start off in this text.

282
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,520
 And Paul's gonna tell us,

283
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,080
 "Hey, if you're gonna win the war in spiritual warfare,

284
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 you have to understand, learn, and know your enemy

285
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,240
 because he has taken time to learn and know you."

286
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,400
 And here's how he says to do that.

287
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,560
 Just look at the text.

288
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,680
 "In knowing your enemy,"

289
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,680
 he says that we have to put on the whole armor of God

290
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,420
 that you may be able to stand

291
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,760
 against the schemes of the devil.

292
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,060
 Most wars are lost

293
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,960
 because the enemy outwitted their opponent.

294
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,680
 Like think about the Trojan horse.

295
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,280
 They're like marching in.

296
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,200
 They're like, "Oh, look, a great gift of a big horse."

297
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,920
 And then kicks down the walls and charge,

298
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,280
 and everyone dies

299
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,440
 because they weren't aware of what was taking place.

300
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,640
 They weren't aware of what the enemy was doing.

301
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,280
 And most wars are lost

302
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,840
 because the enemy in some way outwitted,

303
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,240
 outsmarted their opponent.

304
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,140
 I was talking to a friend yesterday

305
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,400
 and he was like, "What are you talking about?"

306
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,040
 And I was telling him about this idea of how Satan,

307
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,520
 we see, and you're gonna see here in a soon,

308
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,080
 the scriptures, we see that Satan studies us

309
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,720
 and he does whatever he can to attack

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,560
 when we're most vulnerable.

311
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,040
 And so how we as Christians have to know him,

312
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,080
 we have to search God's word and study him

313
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,540
 so that we can get on the offense,

314
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,160
 we can get ahead of him.

315
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,080
 And he's a quarterback.

316
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,120
 And he looked at me and he was like, "JD,

317
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,100
 that's like my entire job."

318
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,240
 Like, sure, yeah, I'm on the offense on Saturday

319
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,060
 when I'm in the game.

320
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,480
 It's like 10% of my job though.

321
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
 Monday through Friday, I am watching film.

322
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 I am studying my opponent.

323
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,840
 I have no chance of winning this game

324
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,200
 if I don't study my opponent.

325
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
 And they make him go and study every single down

326
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
 and watch every different play

327
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,200
 and every different formation.

328
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
 And they had to even get into the personal details

329
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
 of their life.

330
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,920
 They have to learn about who they're dating.

331
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,980
 They have to learn about what they don't like,

332
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,240
 who they voted for, Trump or Biden.

333
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,600
 I mean, they had to learn all these different things

334
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,560
 so they can mess with them

335
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,800
 and use it against them in the game.

336
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,240
 I mean, it is absolutely insane.

337
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,680
 He was just talking to me about,

338
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,600
 the reason why I have to do that

339
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,280
 is 'cause they're doing it against me.

340
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,480
 They're coming to attack me in the game.

341
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,940
 And I have no chance of winning

342
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,720
 if I don't understand my opponent's tactics.

343
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,960
 That's the same for you and I.

344
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,800
 Paul is saying here,

345
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
 if you don't take time to wake up

346
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,960
 and realize that you have an enemy

347
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,360
 and learn him and know him and get ahead of him,

348
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,200
 you are gonna be susceptible to him every single time

349
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,840
 and you will lose the war.

350
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
 You'll lose the daily battle.

351
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,560
 You'll lose the fight against him.

352
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
 And so he says here,

353
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,120
 and the first thing that you do

354
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,440
 is that you put on the armor of God

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,980
 so that you can stand against the schemes of the devil,

356
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,240
 the schemes of the devil.

357
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,080
 We see that since the beginning of the Bible,

358
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,240
 in Genesis three,

359
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,680
 when God created man and woman

360
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
 and wanted them to dwell with him and gave them everything,

361
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
 we see that Satan was very crafty.

362
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,600
 It says in Genesis three,

363
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,620
 that that beast, that the serpent, Satan,

364
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,440
 was more crafty than any other animals

365
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,600
 that the Lord God had made.

366
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,960
 And he comes down and he just uses his craftiness

367
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
 to twist the words of God.

368
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,320
 You've heard the story before,

369
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,360
 where he tells them, did God really say?

370
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,860
 And the reason why I say that he's crafty and not creative

371
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,960
 is because Satan has had the same play

372
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,320
 since the very beginning.

373
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,280
 He wants the same thing for you and I

374
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
 that he wanted for Adam and Eve.

375
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,280
 He's not very creative.

376
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,840
 He has one goal,

377
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,880
 to get you to doubt God's goodness.

378
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,360
 He doesn't want you to trust that God is actually for you.

379
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,260
 That's his play.

380
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,600
 Everything that you do in your life

381
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
 that you choose other than God

382
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
 is because something in you

383
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,320
 did not believe in that moment that God was actually good

384
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,840
 or God was actually worth it.

385
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,280
 In that moment, your sins seem more appetizing than God

386
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,240
 because Satan tricked you.

387
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,360
 He's crafty.

388
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,240
 He's not creative.

389
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,100
 However, he's crafty.

390
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,640
 He schemes.

391
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,800
 He looks for the right opportunity.

392
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,280
 He learns you.

393
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,800
 He studies us.

394
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,600
 He waits for when you're most susceptible to attack.

395
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,720
 And I want you to realize

396
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,800
 that when you think about the craftiness of Satan,

397
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,600
 I'm not talking about the person that's out here

398
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,280
 like murdering people.

399
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,800
 I'm not talking about the person that's out here just like,

400
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,520
 I mean, I can't help but think about the little Nas video

401
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,120
 with like, you know what I'm talking about

402
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,760
 if you've seen it, don't watch it.

403
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,960
 But we laugh and joke.

404
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,500
 And like, basically in this video,

405
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,680
 he just talks about how he has given himself over to Satan.

406
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,800
 And he like, you know, he likes hell, hell's fun.

407
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,920
 And there's so many people that are like,

408
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,800
 man, I guess I'm gonna be in hell with Satan.

409
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
 I might as well smoke a blunt now.

410
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
 And first off to you, I'd say you better watch yourself

411
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,640
 'cause that's not hell.

412
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,280
 Hell is a place of torment

413
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,320
 and you won't be smoking a blunt in hell.

414
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,760
 But, that wasn't in my notes.

415
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,160
 Porch Twitter tonight's like,

416
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
 and you won't be smoking a blunt in hell, @JDRodgers.

417
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,960
 But, think about this.

418
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,360
 Satan is so crafty that why would he go over

419
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,120
 and like worry and give his time and attention

420
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,480
 to someone who's living for him?

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
 He doesn't need to.

422
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,080
 And I think we think, oh, Satan's clearly on that person.

423
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,960
 Look at how bad they're living.

424
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
 No, he's after you.

425
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,600
 He comes after the good.

426
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,440
 He hates that you're here right now.

427
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,260
 He hates that you're hearing this.

428
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,880
 He's coming after you.

429
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,040
 And it's not often in the ways that you think.

430
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,360
 He's coming in the secret.

431
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,080
 He's coming into quiet.

432
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,200
 And it's a slow fade that he draws you

433
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,480
 out of that intimate relationship with God.

434
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,080
 And he gets you comfortable.

435
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,760
 And he has you settle

436
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,760
 in what was once a thriving intimate relationship.

437
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,960
 Like, think about your relationship with God right now.

438
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
 Do you thirst for time with him?

439
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,960
 Like, do you talk to him?

440
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,840
 Are you comfortable?

441
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,280
 When's the last time you shared your faith?

442
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,440
 When's the last time you felt on mission for God?

443
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,720
 The purpose, the sense of wonder

444
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,120
 that he would call you his son and his daughter.

445
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,160
 Satan comes for the Christian.

446
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,320
 He comes to the person who's interested.

447
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,520
 So you and I are here because you're curious

448
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,680
 and you found yourself in a bad place.

449
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,240
 And he's gonna do whatever he can to keep you there.

450
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,280
 'Cause that's what he does.

451
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,560
 But he's gonna do it in the most craftiest way.

452
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
 So be alert.

453
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,240
 Watch film.

454
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,040
 Study your opponent.

455
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,320
 A way that we study our opponent

456
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,040
 is we read the word of God.

457
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,520
 And as I read about Satan

458
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,720
 and as I learn about spiritual warfare,

459
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,440
 here's some obvious things I see that Satan does

460
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,080
 to make sure that we do not know that he is attacking us.

461
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,600
 First, we see here in verse 12,

462
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,920
 "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,

463
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,800
 but against the rulers, against the authorities,

464
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,440
 against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,

465
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,240
 against the spiritual forces of evil

466
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,920
 in the heavenly places."

467
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,040
 We don't wrestle against flesh and blood,

468
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,640
 but we wrestle and we fight and wage war

469
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,480
 against a spiritual realm.

470
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,240
 That means that Satan is supernaturally

471
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,640
 in your superficial problem,

472
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,920
 but he makes it superficial.

473
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,440
 He makes it flesh and blood.

474
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,080
 He's a master illusionist.

475
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,160
 He's a magician.

476
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,560
 Everyone knows that a good magician,

477
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,320
 after the end of their trick at the grand finale,

478
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
 everyone stands on their feet and they're like,

479
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
 "How did he do it?

480
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
 I was watching the whole thing.

481
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,680
 I was right there.

482
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,520
 I touched it.

483
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
 How did that happen?"

484
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,680
 And everyone knows that the best illusionists

485
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,760
 are the people that can get you to focus

486
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,240
 all your energy here,

487
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
 because if you focus all your energy here,

488
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,040
 you are not seeing a sleight of hand here.

489
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,640
 And if he can get you to focus

490
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,480
 and make you think that that person's your problem,

491
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,520
 that that situation's your problem,

492
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,000
 that that sin is your problem,

493
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
 that that relationship is your problem,

494
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,680
 that that church hurt is your problem.

495
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,520
 If he can get you to focus on that social media post

496
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,440
 or whatever it is and divide you

497
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,120
 and create chaos in your life,

498
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
 he's winning.

499
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,080
 And the whole time he's just masterfully

500
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,600
 hiding himself back here.

501
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,040
 He's a master illusionist.

502
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,560
 The division we see today in our culture

503
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,500
 is because people don't believe this verse.

504
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,760
 The division we see across churches today

505
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,840
 and why churches don't feel safe for a lot of people

506
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,200
 is because churches stopped believing in this verse.

507
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,760
 The reason why racism exists today

508
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,560
 is because people stopped believing in this verse.

509
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,600
 There is an enemy who is seeking to divide man

510
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,780
 because he knows that when we are most unified,

511
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,120
 God is most glorified.

512
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,040
 Therefore he makes it his mission to divide us.

513
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,480
 And he's good at it.

514
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,160
 Who in your life is he pulling you from?

515
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,000
 What roommate situation?

516
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,960
 I mean, for me, it's like the dishes.

517
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,120
 And like, you couldn't have just, you know, and.

518
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,240
 And then suddenly that person walks in,

519
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
 they've had a great day.

520
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,680
 And they're like, what's up, man?

521
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,520
 Hey.

522
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,760
 And then suddenly they do the next thing

523
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,440
 and the next thing and the next thing.

524
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,040
 And then meanwhile, they're just living their life

525
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,420
 and you're over here bitter and upset

526
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,680
 and you're missing out on all the fun.

527
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,840
 Because Satan has deceived you.

528
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,000
 He's planted those thoughts in your head.

529
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,400
 He's planted those lies in your head.

530
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,340
 He's kept you from resolving that conflict

531
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,720
 because he wants you alone.

532
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,560
 He wants you isolated because when he can go

533
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,240
 like the lion he is, 1 Peter 5, 8 says,

534
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,720
 "Be watchful, be sober-minded, be aware, be alert

535
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,880
 because your enemy, the devil, prowls around

536
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,000
 like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour."

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,920
 And we know that lions go after the sick.

538
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,620
 Lions go after the weak.

539
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,720
 Lions go after the separated or the baby,

540
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,920
 the one away from the herd.

541
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,400
 And so the reason why he's passionate about dividing

542
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,560
 is because if he can get you isolated and alone,

543
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,420
 you are susceptible, you are vulnerable.

544
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,120
 And that is when he attacks.

545
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,740
 And so do whatever it takes to be unified.

546
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,240
 Do whatever it takes to resolve conflict,

547
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,840
 keep short accounts, run to your brother and sister.

548
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,720
 Don't run from them.

549
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,280
 Talk it out, hug it out, love it out.

550
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,360
 Good.

551
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,220
 (congregation laughing)

552
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,060
 Tonight.

553
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,060
 Something you need to get on the phone tonight

554
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,460
 and call someone and say, "I'm sorry for blank."

555
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:13,680
 Another way that scripture says that he attacks

556
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,040
 is he disguises.

557
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,940
 He's a master of disguise.

558
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,960
 He makes you believe that he is giving you something

559
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,580
 that is life filled and really it only leads to death.

560
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,420
 Second Corinthians 11, 14 says,

561
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,220
 "For even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."

562
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,380
 He makes you think that it's beautiful,

563
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,340
 that this is a good thing, that this is helping you.

564
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,500
 He's masterful at it.

565
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,280
 And really it's hurting you.

566
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,380
 That bad relationship that all your friends have told you,

567
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,420
 "I don't know if I go back to that."

568
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,380
 Oh, but they don't know him.

569
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,460
 They don't know him like I do.

570
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,300
 Like he has this sweet, sensitive side

571
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,540
 that only he shows me, it's like really cute.

572
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,060
 And you know, like you know he doesn't love God.

573
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:01,540
 And Satan's like, "Hey, but you could like help him

574
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,660
 with that, you could pull him closer to God."

575
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,220
 And he like convinces you of like,

576
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,580
 "Man, like when y'all are together, it's a good thing.

577
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,340
 Yeah, it produces a lot of hurt.

578
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,820
 And yeah, y'all are like crossing boundaries

579
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,660
 like you said you wouldn't."

580
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,900
 And all these different things that have caused

581
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,920
 like emotional damage and harm and all this stuff.

582
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,740
 But I mean, come on, this is a good thing.

583
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,540
 And he disguises bad things as life-filling things

584
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,180
 because he's a master disguiser.

585
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,860
 And he disguises himself as an angel of light.

586
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,340
 He deceives, he takes truth and he twists them into lies.

587
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,100
 He knows that if you will believe lies about people,

588
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,380
 about yourself, about God, he has you where he wants you.

589
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,260
 John 8, 44 says this,

590
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,380
 "Satan was a murderer from the beginning.

591
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,300
 He has always hated the truth

592
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,120
 because there is no truth in him.

593
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,020
 When he lies, it is consistent with his character

594
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,820
 for he is a liar and the father of lies."

595
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,020
 He will tell you things like,

596
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,600
 "Hey, like you don't need to go to church.

597
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,380
 Like God is your church.

598
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,820
 Like at home, like set up the screen

599
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,860
 and like you can watch online.

600
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,120
 Like you don't need people."

601
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,500
 Isolation, attack.

602
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,740
 He'll tell you, "Hey, you don't need to like talk

603
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,180
 to people about that problem or that sin.

604
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,260
 Like go to your room and like just talk to God about it."

605
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,220
 And like, 'cause if you tell people,

606
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,720
 like what will they think?

607
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,100
 And they'll like, they don't wanna be around you.

608
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,900
 That's too gross.

609
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,520
 And he knows that if you were to tell them,

610
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,300
 all they have is a loving embrace like your father does.

611
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,540
 And he doesn't wanna experience

612
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,820
 your father's love through them.

613
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,580
 So he tells you, "Keep that.

614
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,700
 Don't tell that part.

615
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,220
 Don't you, don't tell that."

616
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,220
 And he tells you that lie.

617
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,380
 Well, we know that the Bible says,

618
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,900
 "The truth will set you free."

619
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,460
 He wants to keep you bound,

620
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,100
 hidden, dark, isolated.

621
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,840
 He's a deceiver.

622
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,380
 So check yourself, ask yourself, "Where am I life?"

623
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,640
 Hey, it's just a little insert.

624
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,980
 It's just every now and then,

625
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,040
 it's not that big of a problem.

626
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,420
 I don't have to, hey, everyone chill out.

627
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,180
 I don't have to tell anyone.

628
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,620
 Like it's just like once every two months.

629
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,300
 And if you give Satan an inch, he will take a mile.

630
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,020
 And those things are controlling your life,

631
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,360
 whether you like it or not.

632
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
 And so come into the light,

633
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,200
 be truthful and don't believe the deceiver's lies.

634
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,320
 The last way we see is that he destroys.

635
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,760
 He takes a life that is meant for fullness

636
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,240
 and does everything he can to destroy it.

637
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,480
 John 10, 10 says, "The thief comes only to steal

638
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,800
 and kill and destroy.

639
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,020
 But I have come," Jesus says,

640
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,680
 "that you may have life and life to the full."

641
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,560
 I believe that I meet so many people

642
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,920
 who call themselves Christians.

643
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,100
 I fall into this and I see them and I'm like, "Really?

644
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,320
 Is this all Christianity is?"

645
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,020
 Because I don't feel any different.

646
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,280
 And if you've met Christ and you call yourself a Christian

647
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,500
 and your life looks no different,

648
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,420
 I would ask you, have you actually met Christ?

649
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,680
 Because when I read the Bible,

650
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,800
 I see that when you get Christ, you get a new spirit.

651
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,440
 The old dies and the new comes, you're born again.

652
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,980
 And because of that, you begin to die to your flesh

653
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,880
 and live for Christ.

654
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,680
 And out of that comes all of this abundance

655
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,240
 and fruit and life and adventure and joy and peace

656
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,800
 and patience and kindness and all these different things

657
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,080
 begin to mark your life.

658
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,680
 And suddenly all these other things that once defined you

659
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,600
 no longer define you.

660
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,120
 It's just the blood of Jesus that defines you,

661
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,880
 which gives you freedom to be confident all in Jesus.

662
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,840
 But Satan will do anything to take the fullness

663
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,840
 that Jesus offers and destroy you.

664
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,040
 Why?

665
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,760
 Because he knows the end of the story.

666
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,460
 He knows that though we're in a battle today

667
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,280
 and he's been given a little bit of authority on earth,

668
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,580
 he knows how the war ends.

669
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,420
 And he knows that one day Jesus is gonna return

670
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,060
 and damn him to hell forever.

671
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,240
 And he wants to bring down everyone he can.

672
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,060
 No one likes being miserable alone, not even Satan.

673
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,380
 And his mission, it says here, John 10, 10,

674
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,380
 "The thief comes only, only to steal and kill and destroy

675
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,780
 "and steal and kill and destroy."

676
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,020
 What does only mean?

677
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,040
 Only, that's what it means.

678
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,540
 It's like this, imagine this.

679
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,060
 God be with me.

680
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,880
 Imagine, imagine.

681
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,180
 (congregation cheering)

682
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,100
 Yeah, yeah.

683
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,820
 One time I learned this because I was doing some skit

684
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,020
 and they were like, "You need to be able to juggle."

685
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,220
 And I'm like, "What the?"

686
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,500
 I go around the back, I learn it.

687
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,460
 And then I'm like juggling now every now and then.

688
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,500
 And so, okay.

689
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,380
 (congregation laughing)

690
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,700
 The reason why I dropped those balls

691
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,300
 is because I'm not a juggler, okay?

692
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,460
 I got other things to do.

693
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,100
 I got things to live for, okay?

694
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,380
 But imagine if my only point of existence was to juggle.

695
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,100
 Like imagine I was like, you know, born,

696
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,140
 my parents bring me home.

697
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,700
 They like put these tennis balls in my crib.

698
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,140
 They're like, "You, you're gonna change the world.

699
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,180
 "Like you're gonna be the best circus act in all of the,

700
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
 "you're gonna be worldwide, Mr. Worldwide,

701
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,540
 "going around juggling."

702
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,340
 Like, and if that was my mission

703
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,660
 and my only sense of purpose for all of my life

704
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,820
 from the age of like, I don't know,

705
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,940
 when can you start, five?

706
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,940
 Five to like 27, I'd be up here with chainsaws.

707
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,540
 I'd be up here with a fire.

708
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,060
 I'd be up here like hitting cartwheels

709
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,700
 and backhand springs while juggling.

710
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,140
 I'd be able to do all of this stuff

711
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,460
 because it was my only purpose in life.

712
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,900
 But I dropped the balls and all that

713
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,580
 because I have a lot of other stuff to do.

714
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,960
 You, you don't have just one thing that you're called to do.

715
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,560
 Your attention is divided in so many different ways.

716
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,560
 But Satan, since the beginning of time,

717
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,980
 since Genesis, since before that,

718
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,260
 when God kicked him out of heaven,

719
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,420
 his only job has been to steal and take

720
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,580
 and destroy mankind's life.

721
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,480
 Imagine how good he is at it.

722
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,580
 Imagine how masterful he is at knowing

723
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,900
 when that heartbreak anniversary hits for you.

724
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,660
 Imagine when he knows when the death of that family member

725
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,660
 and that day comes.

726
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,640
 I know August 5th is coming for me.

727
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,220
 My dad died, it's gonna be six years.

728
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,540
 And I know that day I have to get ready for battle

729
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,500
 because Satan's coming for me.

730
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,440
 Because on that day, something's in my mind,

731
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,860
 no matter how much I read, how much I know,

732
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,040
 something in me is gonna tell me that God isn't good

733
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,300
 because my dad died of cancer.

734
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,540
 And that's Satan.

735
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,540
 And you know yours.

736
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,420
 You know when you're most susceptible.

737
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,380
 He's masterful.

738
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,220
 He knows when to attack.

739
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,980
 He knows when you're gonna drive home

740
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,660
 and you know you shouldn't go home alone.

741
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,980
 You know you shouldn't be in the room alone

742
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,820
 with that laptop or that technology device.

743
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,540
 He knows it.

744
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,620
 And he watches you do it.

745
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
 And right when you get in that room, boom,

746
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,460
 a wave of temptation to look at that thing you said

747
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,760
 you'd never look at again.

748
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,680
 He is a master at destroying lives.

749
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,260
 And he's coming for you.

750
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,160
 And Paul is saying,

751
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,200
 you have to know that you have an enemy.

752
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
 You have to know how he is coming for you

753
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,860
 so that way you can come for him.

754
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:27,320
 I am desperate for my friends to know

755
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,040
 that you're not just meandering through life,

756
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,920
 that God has a purpose for you.

757
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,640
 It kills me to think that there are people

758
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,400
 in this room tonight that don't believe they have a purpose.

759
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,740
 God loves you.

760
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,480
 And he has a purpose for your life.

761
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,640
 And I know, I know it might be hard to see that,

762
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,040
 but you're being deceived.

763
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,440
 He's disguising himself.

764
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,200
 And he's trying to destroy your life

765
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,160
 in any way that he can.

766
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,700
 And so we, Christian, have to fight.

767
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,440
 We have to ready ourselves for battle.

768
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,880
 This is how we fight our battles.

769
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,080
 We know our enemy.

770
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,400
 We get proactive, not reactive.

771
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,360
 We go on the offense 'cause we got Jesus.

772
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,720
 We fight with truth because we have God's word.

773
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,760
 We get up and we pray before we post on Instagram.

774
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,120
 We as Christians, we get up and we turn to the word

775
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,260
 before we go to work.

776
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,320
 So many people will spend hours and hours

777
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,840
 working their life away and spend five minutes in a Devo,

778
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,080
 wondering why they can't fight off the enemy.

779
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,800
 We turn to our father for guidance and decisions

780
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,440
 before we turn to our friends

781
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,740
 because he loves to guide us and his children.

782
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,240
 We have weapons, but we have to use them

783
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,360
 and we have to know there's an enemy.

784
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,560
 I'm gonna ask y'all to do this.

785
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,640
 I did this right before during worship.

786
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,520
 I just set my alarm clocks.

787
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
 I got three, three alarm clocks

788
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,680
 and they all three say, "Armor up."

789
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,840
 And I just ask you tonight, like, let's remind one another.

790
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,900
 Like go on your alarm clock and just remind yourself,

791
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,620
 say, "Pray, armor up, put your armor on."

792
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,860
 Or just say, "You're in a battle," or "Fight your battles,"

793
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,700
 or whatever you have to write.

794
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,120
 I mean, I'm talking like, let's screenshot that thing,

795
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,020
 share it, whatever you gotta do to remind each other,

796
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,900
 "Hey, don't forget you're in a battle.

797
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,560
 There's an enemy coming for you.

798
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,420
 He's coming to destroy your life."

799
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,540
 And so Paul says, "Since he's coming for you,

800
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,180
 we have to prepare."

801
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,940
 And here's how we prepare.

802
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,540
 In Ephesians 6, continuing in verse 13,

803
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,040
 "Therefore take up the whole armor of God

804
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,720
 that you may be able to withstand in the evil day.

805
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,400
 And having done all to stand firm."

806
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,640
 A soldier without armor,

807
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,620
 he's using this armor illustration,

808
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,940
 going on with the war zone.

809
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,020
 He is saying a soldier without armor

810
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,700
 is vulnerable to attack.

811
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,920
 You've gotta put on your armor.

812
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,400
 You've gotta get ready for battle.

813
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,200
 That tells me, and it communicates to me

814
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,820
 that there is a responsibility on the Christian

815
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,920
 to ready themselves for battle.

816
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,920
 That you have to proactively get up and make a choice today,

817
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,220
 flesh in Satan or life in Jesus.

818
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,820
 He gives us a choice.

819
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,220
 And every day you have to decide

820
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,040
 which one you're gonna choose.

821
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,880
 And I love that he emphasizes

822
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,880
 that you have to put on the whole armor of God.

823
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,160
 He's like, "Hey, just in case you're wondering,

824
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
 there's no good to like put your helmet on

825
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,560
 and then just be like, charge.

826
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,940
 Like you're gonna get shot everywhere else.

827
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,960
 Like you gotta put it all on."

828
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,400
 And that means that it's very important

829
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,260
 that you and I, I'm about to just walk us through each piece.

830
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,940
 And he's saying, "Hey, each piece is so important

831
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,300
 for the Christian life if you choose to follow God."

832
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,500
 Like each piece is so important to protect yourself fully

833
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,360
 from the schemes of the enemy.

834
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,500
 And so take heed.

835
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,420
 I think so many of us one day wanna pick like,

836
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,960
 "Well, here's truth today, maybe.

837
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,660
 And then I'll put on like this, the shoes today

838
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,960
 'cause they look good.

839
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,540
 You know, like I'll put on this piece or this piece

840
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,520
 and I don't wanna do all of that.

841
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,360
 That's like radical Christian stuff."

842
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,980
 And I would tell you to be cautious

843
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,800
 because there is no room for a part-time Christian

844
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,400
 when you have a full-time enemy.

845
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,220
 He is full-time.

846
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,900
 He does not sleep.

847
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,860
 He does not stop working.

848
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,700
 He is working around the clock,

849
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,780
 365 days, seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

850
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,800
 And he's coming for you.

851
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,640
 And so are you ready?

852
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,320
 Paul would say, "This is how you get ready."

853
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,280
 So let's get ready.

854
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
 He's writing this chapter in this book.

855
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,960
 As I said earlier, he was chained to a Roman soldier.

856
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,760
 And so like, I guess the inspiration,

857
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,600
 everyone back then knew about Rome,

858
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
 it's a very powerful empire.

859
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,720
 And so he's using this like metaphor

860
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,800
 of a soldier's outfit, the armor.

861
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,640
 And it's just so funny.

862
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,200
 I picture that moment of him like chained,

863
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,080
 like what if like his good hand was chained

864
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,400
 and like the church in Ephesus was like,

865
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,160
 "Man, his handwriting is just really bad."

866
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,200
 Like, you know, he's just writing with what he's got.

867
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,040
 I picture the soldier like seeing him like,

868
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,920
 "You checking me out?"

869
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
 Like, and he's just like working up and down his armor.

870
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,080
 It's weird, that's how I think.

871
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,600
 But he's looking at this Roman soldier

872
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,120
 and he's describing these elements

873
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,080
 in the way in which they put on their armor.

874
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,320
 And I believe that what he describes here

875
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,780
 is exactly what you and I should wake up with every day

876
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,760
 and put on as we prepare ourself for battle.

877
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,260
 So the first one, he says,

878
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:37,040
 "Having fastened on the belt of truth."

879
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,960
 The belt of truth.

880
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,420
 I mean, you guys know what a belt is.

881
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,420
 A belt's purpose is to hold everything together.

882
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,880
 They actually say that the smartest like commanders

883
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,640
 of this time would tell people to go in the night

884
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,720
 and cut the belts of the enemy.

885
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,600
 That way, when they attacked,

886
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,640
 they were spending all their time

887
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,560
 trying to hold up their trousers and couldn't fight

888
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,800
 and they were vulnerable.

889
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,160
 Because if you don't have your belt, you can't fight.

890
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,120
 The same way, Paul is saying, if you don't have truth,

891
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,200
 you're gonna fall to lies every single day.

892
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,240
 The Satan, like Satan loves to send lies.

893
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,360
 He loves to tell you that you're not worthy,

894
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,720
 that your past is too messed up,

895
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,600
 that he just loves to give shame and guilt

896
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,320
 and remind you of your decisions.

897
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,160
 And he feeds you lies.

898
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,140
 Those people don't like you.

899
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,040
 You would have been invited to that thing.

900
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,480
 Or maybe if you looked a certain way,

901
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,040
 you'd have more followers and you'd be more influential

902
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,740
 and you could start that business.

903
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,640
 Well, hey, maybe if you worked harder,

904
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,480
 you could be more successful

905
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,560
 and you get that atta boy from dad.

906
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,420
 And he feeds you lies and lies and lies.

907
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,100
 And I have watched our generation

908
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,460
 and generations under us,

909
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,300
 following and being deceived by Satan for far too long

910
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,400
 because we don't know truth.

911
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,940
 The world and culture tells you

912
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,600
 that you get to form your own truth,

913
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,420
 that there is no absolute truth.

914
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,100
 If that's your lived experience, if that's what you think,

915
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,220
 if that's your opinion, then that is your truth.

916
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,620
 And don't let anyone tell you different.

917
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,820
 That's what the world tells you.

918
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,320
 And that is baloney.

919
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,260
 That is a lie from Satan.

920
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,380
 There is truth.

921
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,240
 And if you call yourself a Christian,

922
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,060
 then you have agreed to follow the truth

923
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,160
 founded in God's word.

924
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,660
 It is everything you need for decisions,

925
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,100
 for guidance, for how you live.

926
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,320
 The problem is we want to pick our truth

927
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,620
 because we don't like the parts of the Bible

928
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,920
 that contradict our life.

929
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,820
 And you want to tell the Bible what you're going to do.

930
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,600
 You don't want the Bible to tell you what to do.

931
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,700
 You don't want God to tell you what to do.

932
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,300
 And you're vulnerable.

933
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,380
 And you're getting attacked because you don't know truth.

934
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:03,440
 Truth, that belt, it also holds up the next piece of armor,

935
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,980
 the breastplate of righteousness.

936
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,460
 Righteousness is a word that like,

937
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,820
 people don't talk about a lot.

938
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,980
 It's, righteousness basically just means

939
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,660
 right living for God, like living rightly for God.

940
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,380
 It's the same idea as holiness.

941
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,620
 And people like, it's not fun of the young adult ministry

942
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,800
 to talk about righteousness.

943
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,180
 It's not very sexy.

944
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,100
 Like, hey, like do the things the Bible says,

945
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,380
 like live right.

946
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,060
 And that's so sad.

947
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,260
 Because when I choose to not want to live rightly

948
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,140
 according to God's word and what he says is best for me,

949
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,920
 there's something in me that doesn't believe

950
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,580
 that he wants what's best for me.

951
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,620
 And righteous living, living rightly for God,

952
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,860
 it infiltrates every other part of your being.

953
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,140
 The breastplate in these times would go from the neck

954
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,200
 to the knees and also the back.

955
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,660
 That means that it would cover the major organs of the body.

956
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,060
 It would also cover the most important organ of the body,

957
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,180
 the heart, and the heart pumps blood

958
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,740
 into the rest of the body.

959
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,420
 And so Satan knows if I can get them to live disobedient,

960
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,980
 disobedient to God's word,

961
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,580
 then I have them right where I want them.

962
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,020
 If I can get them to live wrongly

963
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,340
 and not trust that God's way is the best way,

964
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,200
 I have them right where I want them.

965
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,060
 If I can have them convinced that they can go out

966
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,580
 and get drunk and be hung over at church the next day

967
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,060
 and get their God fix for the week,

968
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,500
 I have them right where I want them.

969
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,940
 And what he does is he creates this watered down version

970
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,700
 of Christianity where you get to have God and your sin.

971
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,180
 Like you get to have God's way and your way.

972
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,980
 And you get to kind of like come back and forth.

973
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,500
 And it's like a balance beam where like,

974
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,580
 you get to like, today I'm gonna like be my way.

975
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,420
 And then I'm gonna go be like, oh God, I'm so sorry.

976
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,940
 And then like, I'm gonna do for you for two days

977
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,420
 and then, oh, go out and do my way.

978
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,300
 And then, oh, and this is this exchange back and forth,

979
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,140
 back and forth.

980
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,340
 And he has you right where he wants you.

981
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,660
 That's not righteousness.

982
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,060
 God says the best way to live,

983
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,660
 where you get to experience full life

984
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,700
 is by right living according to my word.

985
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,740
 And what it has for you,

986
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,360
 the problem is, is we don't like that.

987
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,400
 That's not fun.

988
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,800
 It doesn't always feel good.

989
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,260
 And you're susceptible to getting attacked

990
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,620
 by the enemy because of it.

991
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,060
 The next few, I'll kind of go through quick.

992
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,340
 He says, "As shoes to your feet,

993
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,880
 having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace."

994
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,920
 The shoes at this time would have little spikes on them,

995
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,760
 like cleats.

996
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,360
 And I love that he says that these were,

997
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,520
 they've put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.

998
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,840
 What he's saying there is,

999
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,260
 these soldiers were ready for battle because they had grip,

1000
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,760
 because they could stand firm.

1001
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,120
 They didn't slip, they didn't slide.

1002
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,420
 They could run and proactively chase down their enemy

1003
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,840
 because of the grips on their shoes.

1004
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,700
 And the grips was given to them by the gospel of peace.

1005
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,400
 This tells me that Paul is telling us

1006
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,120
 that if you believe that Jesus Christ left heaven

1007
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,600
 and came to earth and died for your sins

1008
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,000
 and was buried and rose again,

1009
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,160
 conquering sin and shame once and for all,

1010
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,600
 and if you believe in that,

1011
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,800
 you now, your life can be marked by peace

1012
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,660
 and you can run against any battle.

1013
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,340
 You can run towards any enemy

1014
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,240
 because you have a firm foundation on your life

1015
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,160
 that is the gospel of Jesus Christ.

1016
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,600
 If you're slipping and sliding through life,

1017
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,440
 if you're sinking in quicksand,

1018
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,320
 if you don't know how if you can take another step forward,

1019
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,680
 it's probably 'cause you haven't preached the gospel

1020
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,240
 to yourself in a long time,

1021
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,120
 or you've never received it before in your life.

1022
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,080
 The gospel is the only grip that we can have

1023
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,460
 that can give us the confidence to run into the battle.

1024
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,620
 And the result is peace every time.

1025
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,640
 The next thing in the armor is in all circumstances,

1026
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,300
 take up the shield of faith

1027
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,560
 with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts

1028
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,260
 of the evil one.

1029
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,200
 I find this so interesting that Paul gives the caveat,

1030
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,360
 in all circumstances, you need the shield of faith.

1031
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,440
 Why does he say that?

1032
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,360
 Like I said earlier,

1033
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,600
 Satan knows that you are most susceptible

1034
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,940
 and he sends his weapons that are the fiery arrows

1035
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,800
 that Paul describes into your life,

1036
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,900
 the temptations, the lies, the hard things in your life.

1037
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,220
 He brings them upon you

1038
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,220
 when you're going through really hard storms,

1039
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,560
 when you're going through really hard circumstances,

1040
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,200
 that is when he aims and fires.

1041
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,440
 And so the way that you fight that weapon

1042
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,880
 and do not fall back into fear is that you stand in faith

1043
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,400
 because you have the shield of faith

1044
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,020
 knowing that God is with you.

1045
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,760
 You have faith in him, not in your circumstance.

1046
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,560
 That's what the shield of faith does.

1047
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,060
 That's what faith in God does,

1048
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,700
 is it defends off the attacks of the enemy on your life

1049
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,060
 in every circumstance.

1050
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,420
 If your life is marked by just a roller coaster,

1051
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,860
 that when life is good, you're good,

1052
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,660
 but when it's bad, man, you're bad,

1053
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,900
 I would ask yourself, does faith in Christ mark your life?

1054
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,460
 Do you have a shield to protect you from those arrows?

1055
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,900
 And he says, take the helmet of salvation.

1056
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,540
 We know that a helmet protected the brain,

1057
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,140
 it protected the head.

1058
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,880
 You were in a lot of trouble if you took a blow to the head.

1059
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,360
 If anything messed with your brain,

1060
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,200
 the brain, it deals with your mind

1061
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,000
 and Satan loves to attack the mind.

1062
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,800
 Assurance and salvation that you are saved

1063
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,300
 from the attacks of the enemy.

1064
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,420
 That helmet is where it protects you in the everyday battle.

1065
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,760
 And then lastly, our offensive weapon that he gives us.

1066
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,440
 You cannot go to battle without a weapon.

1067
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,600
 And he says, the sword of the spirit,

1068
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,880
 which is the word of God.

1069
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,360
 The word of God is the sword of the spirit that we fight

1070
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,360
 and we attack the enemy.

1071
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,780
 I think so many people, when the enemy attacks us,

1072
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,320
 we're like, oh my, what was me?

1073
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,040
 I can't, I'm such a dark cave, I don't know what to do.

1074
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,120
 And we forget the power that we have

1075
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,040
 through the Holy Spirit.

1076
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,940
 We forget that what Christ offered us

1077
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,960
 through his blood shed on the cross.

1078
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,680
 And now when I say the word of God is a sword,

1079
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,840
 I'm not talking about like, I'm God, like with your Bibles.

1080
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,000
 That's not what I'm talking about.

1081
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,080
 But I'm talking about this right here is a weapon.

1082
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,280
 How do we fight our battles?

1083
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,560
 The word of God, the Holy Spirit speaks through us.

1084
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,280
 And when Satan comes and offers us nothing but lies

1085
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,160
 and deceptive things and all those different things

1086
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,640
 that he tries to do to attack us,

1087
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,680
 we get to stand upon the word of God that does not change.

1088
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,680
 And the reason why you change, the reason why we fall,

1089
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,960
 the reason why we lay prey to his attacks

1090
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,000
 is because we don't know the word.

1091
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,720
 We'd rather read some self-care book

1092
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,280
 before reading the book.

1093
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,720
 We'd rather watch a one minute sermon to get our fix

1094
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,380
 than going and reading and studying

1095
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,740
 the characteristics of our God.

1096
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,240
 No wonder you don't trust him, you don't know him.

1097
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,120
 You can't trust someone you don't know.

1098
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,120
 This is how we know our God.

1099
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,640
 This is how we see his love for us.

1100
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,240
 This is just one big masterful love book.

1101
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,080
 Sure, Satan is masterful and he's crafty,

1102
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,560
 but God is beautiful.

1103
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,740
 He's the master.

1104
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,880
 And when you read this,

1105
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,880
 you see that he has such a plan for you.

1106
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,840
 And suddenly when Satan comes and he tells you

1107
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,360
 you're not worthy or that no one wants you,

1108
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,640
 you get to speak the word of God and it acts as a weapon

1109
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,400
 and it pierces the lies of the enemy.

1110
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,260
 There's power in the spirit of God inside of you.

1111
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:38,260
 And if you felt weaponless, if you felt defenseless,

1112
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,940
 and if you felt like you have been hit

1113
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,300
 and dragged down by the enemy, I would ask yourself,

1114
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,160
 do you have the spirit of God in you?

1115
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,460
 Do you have a relationship with Jesus?

1116
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,340
 Tonight, everything can change for you.

1117
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,420
 You can get on the offense,

1118
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,700
 you can get up and you can charge the enemy

1119
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,880
 and you can have a sword in your hand.

1120
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,700
 That can be free for you tonight if you receive it.

1121
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,540
 Everything can change about your battle.

1122
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,700
 I started off this talking about that story with my dad.

1123
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,620
 And when I heard that scream

1124
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,220
 and I realized that there was an enemy in the woods,

1125
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,940
 everything changed.

1126
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,580
 I told you about my awareness,

1127
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,500
 but that wasn't the only thing that changed.

1128
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,660
 I looked down and I realized if a mountain lion attacks me,

1129
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,860
 I don't got a gun.

1130
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,660
 And I looked at my dad and I was like,

1131
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,020
 that's the bad man with the gun.

1132
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,220
 And so what did I do?

1133
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,220
 I no longer just walked behind my dad.

1134
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,180
 I got right in the smack as close as I could

1135
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,260
 in front of my dad.

1136
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,700
 And he's behind me holding this gun.

1137
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,040
 I remember looking back and being like, okay, yeah,

1138
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,180
 come on, mountain lion.

1139
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,860
 I still dare you to try.

1140
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,280
 Got my dad back here.

1141
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,840
 And the reason why I went there,

1142
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:59,660
 and when I look at this verse and it says,

1143
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,700
 "The sword of the spirit, which is the word of God."

1144
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,420
 I want you to think back,

1145
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,500
 like it could be really easy to read these verses

1146
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,540
 and go, oh my gosh, like this is a lot JD.

1147
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,140
 Like tomorrow, like I'm gonna wake up

1148
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,420
 and what if I forget to like,

1149
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,660
 what if I believe a lie and like arrow?

1150
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,300
 Or like, what if I do something wrong?

1151
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,860
 Like, should I have like reminders every 30 minutes?

1152
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,260
 Like, how do I do all of this?

1153
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,740
 And we have to rest in the beauty

1154
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,500
 of the first verse of this passage.

1155
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:40,940
 Verse 10 says, "Finally, be strong in the Lord

1156
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:45,780
 and in the strength of his might."

1157
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,560
 Paul was genius to list out these articles of the armor

1158
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,820
 because all of these articles point to Jesus,

1159
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,020
 the belt of truth.

1160
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,800
 Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth and the life."

1161
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,020
 The breastplate of righteousness,

1162
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,740
 Jesus who knew no sin became sin

1163
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,780
 so that we could become the righteousness of God.

1164
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,720
 The shoes of peace, Romans 5 says,

1165
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,720
 "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

1166
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,080
 The shield of faith, Ephesians 2 says,

1167
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,540
 "It's not by works that we receive salvation,

1168
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,820
 but it's by grace through faith that we are saved."

1169
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,400
 The helmet of salvation, John chapter three says,

1170
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,440
 "For God did not send his son Jesus into the world

1171
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,940
 to condemn the world, but to save the world."

1172
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,460
 It's through Jesus that we have salvation.

1173
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,700
 The sword of the spirit, because of Jesus's death

1174
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,100
 and burial and resurrection, all who believe in him

1175
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,340
 no longer have to live according to their flesh,

1176
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,780
 but according to the spirit,

1177
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,220
 because the spirit of God now can come inside of us

1178
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,420
 and he's the one who fights.

1179
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,820
 It's Jesus who fights on our behalf.

1180
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,540
 And so when you're putting on the armor of God,

1181
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,700
 you are putting on Jesus and it's him.

1182
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,020
 It's his responsibility.

1183
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,900
 It's his delight to fight for you.

1184
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,720
 Everything changed about my confidence

1185
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,760
 and the way that I pursued my life

1186
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,160
 when I knew that my dad was behind me with a weapon,

1187
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,060
 ready to attack the enemy for me.

1188
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,180
 Nothing feared.

1189
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,180
 I was fully confident walking forward in the same way.

1190
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,000
 We have an opportunity to have confidence

1191
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,220
 in the spirit of God inside of us,

1192
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,840
 that it's him who fights on our behalf.

1193
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,620
 And my fear is that so many of us wake up

1194
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,740
 and we don't live like this is true.

1195
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,720
 We don't access the power that we have

1196
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,520
 through the word of God.

1197
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,500
 We don't access the faith that's possible

1198
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,540
 in the midst of the storm.

1199
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,720
 And we miss it.

1200
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,700
 We miss all that we have because we're being deceived,

1201
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,360
 because he's disguising himself a little too well,

1202
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,280
 because he's doing everything he can to destroy our lives.

1203
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,960
 But when you put on the armor of God,

1204
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,060
 when you wake up and you say,

1205
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,780
 I will not live for Satan and his schemes today.

1206
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,320
 I am living for the son of God and I'm letting him fight.

1207
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,600
 Everything changes.

1208
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,720
 But how?

1209
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,440
 Every day, making the choice.

1210
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,380
 You're believing that we know, if you're a Christian,

1211
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,620
 you know the end of the story, just like Satan knows.

1212
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,100
 You know that the war ends with Jesus, the victor.

1213
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,400
 The Bible says that he is gonna come back,

1214
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,320
 riding triumphantly on that white horse, sword in hand.

1215
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,820
 And he's gonna claim us, the church, once and for all,

1216
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,500
 and Satan and sin and the demons will run.

1217
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,900
 And he will banish them to hell forever.

1218
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,340
 And sin and its hold on the world

1219
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:46,860
 will be no more at the name of Jesus.

1220
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,380
 But though we know the war is conquered by Jesus,

1221
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,900
 it doesn't mean the battle isn't real today.

1222
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,400
 It doesn't mean that we don't have a part to play.

1223
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,540
 And so Paul ends, everyone says

1224
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,220
 there's six pieces of armor.

1225
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,120
 I'd actually argue that there's seven.

1226
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,440
 He ends with 18, praying at all times in the spirit,

1227
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,960
 with all prayer and supplication.

1228
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,400
 Supplication just means prayers.

1229
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,520
 To that end, keep alert with all perseverance,

1230
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,900
 making supplication for all the saints.

1231
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,900
 Prayer is how we access the spirit of God

1232
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,580
 to come and fight our battles.

1233
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,940
 That's how we fight our battles.

1234
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,800
 We pray.

1235
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,140
 Prayer postures our heart.

1236
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,620
 It humbles us.

1237
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,220
 It causes us to open up our hands and say,

1238
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:44,300
 God, I need you to fight the battle today.

1239
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,980
 I'm putting on the armor of God,

1240
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,820
 trusting that I am putting on you, Jesus,

1241
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,620
 to fight on my behalf.

1242
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:54,180
 I can't do it on my own, but you can.

1243
00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:00,780
 Second Chronicles 7.14, I'll end with this, says,

1244
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,860
 "If my people who are called by my name

1245
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:08,800
 will humble themselves and pray and seek my face

1246
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,360
 and turn from their wicked ways,

1247
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,020
 then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin

1248
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,700
 and I will heal their land."

1249
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,660
 Our land is in desperate need of healing.

1250
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,660
 Our generation is searching and longing.

1251
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,040
 And God just says, if you would trust me.

1252
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:34,180
 When Satan sees Christians who are willing

1253
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,340
 to get on their knees and pray,

1254
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,420
 he has no choice but to flee

1255
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,060
 because he knows he stands no chance

1256
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,860
 against the spirit of God.

1257
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,900
 That's how we fight our battles.

1258
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,740
 And so right now, what we're gonna do

1259
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,240
 is I just wanna take some time to pray

1260
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,860
 and ask God to come and protect us,

1261
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,120
 to protect this church, to protect this ministry,

1262
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,220
 to protect our hearts, to help us live righteously.

1263
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,200
 I want us to ask God that he would give us

1264
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,460
 the desires of his heart, to live on mission for him,

1265
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:10,160
 to no longer be deceived by the enemy,

1266
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,140
 but to want to live for his spirit.

1267
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,940
 And so I know that for some of you,

1268
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,420
 I wouldn't expect you to walk up to me right now

1269
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,980
 if we didn't have a relationship and like hug me

1270
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,580
 and talk to me like we've been best friends forever.

1271
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,420
 And some of you don't have a relationship with God.

1272
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:22,580
 And I get that praying, especially next to people,

1273
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,340
 might be a really weird and uncomfortable thing.

1274
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,380
 And so it might just start, simply start and start simply.

1275
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,740
 Just start by opening up your hands and saying tonight,

1276
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,820
 God, will you help me?

1277
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,300
 For some of you, you've been comfortable

1278
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,140
 and you've been deceived by the enemy for too long

1279
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,580
 and you need him.

1280
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,780
 You need God to wake you up and revive your soul

1281
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,060
 and to bring you back to your first love.

1282
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:43,900
 Pray for it.

1283
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:48,580
 And so whether you want to stand up,

1284
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,140
 whether you want to lift your hands,

1285
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,580
 whether you want to get on your knees,

1286
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,780
 whether you want to open up your hands,

1287
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,460
 if you just want to sit there,

1288
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,580
 I'm just going to give us a chance to stop and pray

1289
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,620
 and practice and believe God and take him at his word

1290
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,860
 that he says, if my people would call my name and pray,

1291
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,920
 I will hear them.

1292
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,180
 I will heal their land.

1293
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,340
 I'll forgive them of their sins.

1294
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,320
 God, we need you.

1295
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,620
 Take a moment to pray now.

1296
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,200
 (gentle music)

1297
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,780
 (gentle music)

1298
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,360
 (gentle music)

1299
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,940
 (gentle music)

1300
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,520
 (gentle music)

1301
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:33,260
 (gentle music)

1302
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:39,780
 (gentle music)

1303
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:46,220
 (gentle music)

1304
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,800
 (gentle music)

1305
00:54:48,800 --> 00:55:06,660
 Almighty God,

1306
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,020
 the protector of our souls,

1307
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,840
 our shield, our sword,

1308
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,200
 our conqueror,

1309
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,260
 we need you.

1310
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,760
 Would you reveal to us where we have believed the lies

1311
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,720
 of the enemy for far too long?

1312
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,280
 Would you wake us up?

1313
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,120
 Would you make us more aware of his schemes?

1314
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:39,700
 I pray that tonight people would not receive this message

1315
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,260
 and it strike fear and scare them,

1316
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,020
 but you'd use it to prepare them,

1317
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,540
 that you'd make them more aware

1318
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,240
 so that way they can prepare for battle and fight

1319
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,620
 the good fights.

1320
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:56,220
 We know that greater is he who is in us

1321
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,900
 than he who is in the world.

1322
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,460
 And so you are the one we trust in God.

1323
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,660
 You are the one that we live for.

1324
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,860
 May it start here in Dallas, Texas.

1325
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,220
 May you use the people in this room

1326
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:12,200
 to say it ends here.

1327
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,120
 The generational sin ends here.

1328
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,500
 The anti-Jesus culture ends here.

1329
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,180
 We will use our platforms to declare of his name.

1330
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,420
 We will use our workplaces to declare of his name.

1331
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,280
 We will use our stories to proclaim of his name.

1332
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,520
 Because God, you are the one we live for.

1333
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,580
 And if there's anything that we have believed

1334
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,340
 that has taken us from you,

1335
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,900
 would you open our eyes to it tonight?

1336
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,900
 If there's a person who doesn't have a relationship with you

1337
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,300
 and they've been following the world

1338
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,820
 and not the word and not you,

1339
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,340
 not your son and his blood,

1340
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,140
 would you speak to them right now?

1341
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:00,460
 God, we come fully confident in you,

1342
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,820
 in the blood of Jesus,

1343
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,180
 understanding that it's through you

1344
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,340
 and it's through your spirit.

1345
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,840
 That is how we fight our battles.

1346
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:13,560
 The darkness has to flee at the name of Jesus.

1347
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,400
 So we ask right now that would be done

1348
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,040
 as we worship and respond.

1349
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,840
 It's your name that we pray, amen.

1350
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,340
 Amen.
