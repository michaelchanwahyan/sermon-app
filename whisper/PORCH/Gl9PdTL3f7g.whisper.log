[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   [ Singing ]
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   [ Singing ]
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   [ Singing ]
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   [ Singing ]
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   [ Singing ]
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   >> Guys, what did they say though?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   They said Jesus, we're too thankful for words.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   A lot of times.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Jesus, we're too thankful for words.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Words are important though.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Those are friends of ours, Portugalers just like you.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I recognize some of them as they walk off the stage,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   friends who stumbled into this place.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Some of them came from Christian backgrounds.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Some of them were raised in the church.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Others of them couldn't stop getting high.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Others of them couldn't stop sleeping with their boyfriends.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And all of them came to this place and heard a call to get on a plane
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   and go overseas, specifically Ethiopia.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And they did so.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And the Lord used the trip to grab their hearts and put a song in their hearts.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's what the scripture says Jesus does is he put a song in our hearts.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And so they shared that song with you.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I'd love to just start by talking about -- they started that way because we're
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   talking about reaching the ends of the earth tonight with the gospel as we move
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   through the series and wrap up tonight in our Unashamed series.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so I'll start with just some kind of strange pictures.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   This first one is particularly strange.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I'll have to explain.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   This is a pink dolphin of the Amazon.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And we got to swim with the pink dolphins.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   They are pink because the water is so dark there.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And they're freshwater dolphin.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And it was just fun to get in the water with them and get to hang out there on
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   the Amazon River near Manaus, Brazil.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And so this next one, this is a leopard skin.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yes, a leopard skin.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Also in Brazil.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Someone had just killed it a couple weeks before we got there and wanted to
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   share that with us.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Actually offered us its skull.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   What a prize.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   They said, "Here, go home.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Go back with this leopard skull."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I was like, I remember talking to Tim, like, "How are we going to get this
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   thing on the plane?"
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And I think it's illegal.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And then this next one, this is an alligator that we caught on an alligator
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   hunt with one of the missionaries there in Brazil.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   He took us out and we were looking for crocodiles of the Amazon.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And we didn't want to catch his father, but we did catch him.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And then now jumping continents, this is Africa.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Here, this is the Maasai warriors, the Maasai Mara near an area of Kenya in
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   the African jungle.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You always hear about the African Bushmen.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   What happens to the African Bushmen who never hears the gospel?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   This is the African Bushmen right here with his piercings.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And that's an earring.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's quite an earring, actually.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   That is indeed a Maasai warrior.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And then here, that was his lion club that he had made, and I traded him a
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Swiss army knife for it.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And he made the trade, and I brought that back.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I still have it today, keeping me safe.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   This is a mass grave there in Rwanda.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   When over a million people died or nearly a million people died in the
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   genocide, the government built this mass grave for them.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And as we visited that, that was one of the things that we saw.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And then we also saw this.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   This is the king of the jungle.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   There is no fence between me and him.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   This guy was just out roaming around hunting.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Probably that.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   That's an elephant.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Four to be precise.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And now again, jumping continents now to an island nation of Haiti, one of the
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   most beautiful beaches I've ever seen in the world there on the island nation of
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Haiti.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Also the most beautiful sunsets at our partner, Mission of Hope.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   We got to see that sunset every single night.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And then there's the Haitian waterfall with me and my port shirt, praising God
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and the glory of his creation on the island nation of Haiti.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And here's why I show you all of that.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Because I believe with all my heart that I can compel you tonight to get on a
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   plane and to go overseas.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And I believe with all my heart on the way back, you will thank me that I did
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   so.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You will be very, very glad that you used a week's vacation to do so.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But I do not want you to get on a plane to see a pink dolphin, a waterfall, a
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   sunset, a very beautiful beach, a Maasai warrior, a lion, or anything of the
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   like.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   In fact, the most amazing things of all of those trips, if I didn't see any of
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   those things, the most beautiful, incredible things of all of those trips
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   that I went on were the people and we intentionally left them out apart from
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   the Maasai warrior.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But the most amazing thing, and you must believe me because I would not lie to
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   you right up top of the message, the most memorable experiences I had, be it in
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   the Amazon, be it in Africa, be it in Haiti or anywhere else I've ever been,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   were the people, God's creation, those he made in his image.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And the most amazing experience that I had in all of those places, we get to
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   tell them this amazing news that they don't have to go to hell.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   That they can be with God forever in his kingdom.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That God loved them so much that he took all the crazy stuff, the genocide, the
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   fact that you killed your brother's wife.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Jesus died for that and you don't have to go to hell, you can be with him
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   forever.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's good news.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And to get to sit on a soccer field after playing a soccer game with a bunch of
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   kids and ask them with an EvangelCube, "Do you want to trust in this Jesus?"
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "For your salvation?"
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And for them to say in their broken English or through an interpreter, "Yes, I
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   do."
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   "Can I do that now?"
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   And to know that those people today as we gather in this room, maybe they're
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   sleeping, maybe they're not, maybe they're playing soccer, maybe they're eating
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   dinner or breakfast.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But to know that we will be with them again.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   That one day we will be in the fullness of the presence of God and his glory.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Face to face with them again.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Remember when we played soccer?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Remember when you prayed to trust in Jesus?
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Man, that was awesome.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Now the pink dolphins, that was cool too.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But when you prayed, when you understood the hope that you have in Christ, man,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   it was amazing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And what I can't do, or I'm sorry, what I hope God does in spite of me tonight,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   is not to give you an excitement about jaguars, dolphins, elephants, lions,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   tigers and bears, oh my.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But to give you a heart for his people all over the world.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   People that if you don't go and see, and if you don't go and share, we won't get
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   to see them again.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Because there are so many people on this planet right now as we gather in this
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   room who have not heard the name of Jesus and have not had the opportunity to
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   trust him.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I'm not talking about unsaved people.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I'm talking about unreached people.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And there's a difference.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   An unsaved person is someone who has heard the gospel and rejected it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   An unreached person is someone who won't or who hasn't had the opportunity to
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   hear the gospel.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Do those people exist today?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Indeed they do.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   There's 4,083 unreached people groups in the world.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   This is groups of people who have not had the opportunity to hear the gospel,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   nor do they have the Bible maybe in their language or available to them.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   There are 2,998,119,000 unreached people living today, alive today, destined for
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   hell, having not heard the saving message of Jesus Christ under the condemnation
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   of their sin.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   2,670 people groups, or roughly 204 million individuals in the world, have no
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   scriptures or audio recordings available in their primary language.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   339 of the 550 people groups in China do not even have Bible portions available
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   in their primary language.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   35 of the 78 people groups in Afghanistan do not even have Bible portions
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   available in their primary language.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   And I talk a lot about our generation.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Some have told me that I'm hard on our generation, millennials, Generation Y,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   those born between 1980 and 2000.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   I talk a lot about how it is very, very possible that our nation is lost due to
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   us not taking our faith seriously.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But I want you to know there is really good news in the midst of that, that there
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   is a purification of Christianity happening.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   There are people who are nominal believers who are falling off, but there are
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   people who are real believers, those indwelled by the Holy Spirit who are
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   taking that message and leveraging their life like the apostles did for the sake
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   of the spreading of the gospel and the building of his kingdom.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And plainly put, in layman's terms, those who will live their lives for the sake
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   of telling others the story of Jesus Christ so that they can be with him
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   forever.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And that's happening in your generation.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   It is very, very possible that in your generation the entire world is reached
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   for the sake of the gospel.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It was not possible prior to today, but due to the world wide web, a literal
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   string of wires that stretches and bonds every single continent on the planet,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and due to satellite imaging, for the first time we can see any place on the
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   planet.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Not only can you see it, but it sits in your pocket on your phone.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I can call someone halfway around the world right now and see them.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   For the first time in history, it is very possible that we all see the return of
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Christ at once, and moreover, we can pave a way for him coming by preaching the
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   gospel to every nation, as Matthew 24 says, must happen before he returns.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And so that is what we can do, and that is what I hope we will do, and I hope the
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Lord uses the rest of our evening tonight.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   As we talk about to the ends of the earth, taking this light to the ends of the
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   earth, we're in a series called Unashamed.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Week one, we talked about our Jerusalem.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   These are the places that you go on an everyday basis.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Your Jerusalem is your Starbucks, your grocery store, the place where you work,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   your school, your neighborhood, your apartment community.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   This is your Jerusalem.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   What is your responsibility to your Jerusalem?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   It is to be a light there, that wherever you are, the Holy Spirit indwells you.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   If you are a Christian, that is, if you've trusted in Jesus Christ, death and
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins, then you have the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   you're going to be with God forever, and your responsibility is to be a light
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   wherever you are, to push back darkness wherever you go.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Okay?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Then week two, we talked about our Judea and Samaria.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   This is Dallas, Fort Worth.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   This is DFW, the area that is entrusted to us, that there are those in need around
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   us that we should go to and shine a light there.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   There are those who do not have food today, that do not have money today,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   that do not have a place to live today, and moreover, all of those things do not
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   have the saving good news of Jesus Christ today in our area that we are
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   responsible for, and so we take it to them, and we shine a light in those places.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Week three, tonight, we're talking about taking the gospel to the ends of the
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   earth, specifically the path that we'll walk down is the method of salvation,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   why it's necessary to share it, and then before you leave here this evening,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   how we measure success in missions, how we measure our success as we take this
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   saving message to the ends of the earth.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We're going to be in Paul's letter to the church in Rome, chapter 10, Romans
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   chapter 10, so you have the gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the New
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Testament, the second half of your Bible.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Then you have Acts, then you have Romans, if you would turn there, turn to chapter
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   10, I'll start in verse 8.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Paul writes, "What does it say?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The word is near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is the message,"
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   so what is the word?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   "The message concerning faith that we proclaim.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You might be here, and you might say, "Hey, how am I saved?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Saved from what?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Saved from sin, the consequences of sin, saved from hell, saved to God, saved to
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   heaven.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   How does it happen?"
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It says right here, plainly in Romans 10, 9, "If you declare with your mouth that
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Jesus Christ is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   then you will be saved, not you might be saved, not you'll probably be saved, you
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   will be saved.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   For it is with your mouth that you believe and are justified, and it is with your
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   your faith and are saved."
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   The word "justified" there just means to be declared righteous.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Here's why that's important, because if you're here and you're a Christian, every
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   now and then someone will say, "How did you become a Christian?"
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   They'll say, "Well, I've always been a Christian."
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   That's not a true statement.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   You have not always been a Christian.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   There was a point of justification.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   There was one moment in your life when you were headed toward hell, and then there
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   was another moment where you've trusted in Christ, his finished work on the cross
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   for the forgiveness of your sins, and you were in that moment declared righteous,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   meaning that God is no longer counting your sins against you.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   You don't have to pay for them.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Jesus paid for them, and you trusted that.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Therefore, you are justified or declared righteous.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   As Scripture says, "Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame, for there
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   is no difference between Jew and Gentile.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   The same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   For everyone who calls in the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "Call" there means to pray in faith for salvation.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Simply put, I need someone to save me.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I need a Savior.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   God provided a Savior in Jesus Christ.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   There's a moment in your life where you realize you are drowning in your sin, and you need
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   someone to save you from your sin.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   That Savior, that lifeguard, if you will, is Christ Jesus.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   That is the gospel.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   My first point this evening is the method of our salvation is a message.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   This is important.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   The method of our salvation is a message.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   How is someone saved?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   How does someone cross over from death to life, hell to heaven?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   It doesn't just happen.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It's a message.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   The power comes through words that are shared.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   A message.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   This is very simple.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Let me explain it like this.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Growing up, we wouldn't ever really travel overseas.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I'd never been on an airplane until the eighth grade.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Our vacations looked like tubing the river.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   There was this one particular time we went and tubed the river in this area in far east Texas.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   It wasn't green.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Maybe that's what you know of, tubing the river.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Maybe you've been on green with an inner tube and a bud light.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   That's not what I'm talking about here.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   This is a different kind of tubing the river.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   This is one with Mom and Dad present, and I was eight.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   We're there, and the guy is telling us, "Maybe you've went whitewater rafting."
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   You can picture this.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   We're about to tube the river, and the guy is very concerned about this fork in the river where he says,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   "If you go left, there is a drop-off."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   He keeps telling us, "You do not want to go left.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   You do not want to go left.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   You will see signs that tell you not to go left.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Make sure you stay to the right."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   As we were tubing the river, we began to pass those signs.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "Hey, the fork in the river is coming.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Make sure you stay to the left."
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Or, "Make sure you stay to the right."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   "Make sure you stay to the right."
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Then we got to this one big sign that simply said, "If you go left, you will die," which I appreciated.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I appreciated that.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   We went right, and we were safe, and we enjoyed our river tubing trip.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   But that is what you are.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Friends, you are simply a sign carrying a message that if you continue in your ways,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   you will die.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   But I have good news.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   You do not have to die, for there is one who died on your behalf.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   His name is Jesus Christ.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   If you believe that he died on your behalf, if you believe that he paid the price for your sins,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   then you will live with God forever.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   That is indeed the gospel, which simply translates "good news."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   You are a sign.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   You are a fork in the road.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   In fact, Jim Elliott said it like this.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   This was his prayer.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Jim Elliott was a missionary.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   He prayed, "Father, make me a crisis man.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Bring those I contact to a decision.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Let me not be a milepost on a single road.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Make me a fork that men must turn one way or another on facing Christ in me."
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Lord, make me a fork that when someone comes to me, and they come in contact with Christ in me,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   they have to go right or left, but they cannot continue in their ways.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   They have to deliberately choose to reject your message or to accept your message and be with you forever.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But make me a fork.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   We have a message.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   God uses messengers to carry it forward.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Who are the messengers?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It is simply, guys, those who have believed upon the message.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Anyone who has believed upon the saving good news of the gospel, that they have trusted Christ,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   and they then carry that selflessly forward.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Why? Because it was selflessly shared with them.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And that is how Christianity works.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It is the last part of the gospel.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   The last part of the gospel is not simply the resurrected Jesus.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   In fact, the last thing the resurrected Jesus said was to go and to share this good news to all the ends of the earth.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   That you would take it forward.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Christianity is like the largest multi-level marketing program the world has ever seen.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   If you are not familiar with the term, maybe you have heard it called network marketing,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   or maybe you have heard it called pyramid scheme.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It has a negative connotation in many circles.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Think Amway, if you are familiar with that, or something else that you are involved in,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   or your cousin or aunt are involved in.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   The simple way that this works is you buy their product,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and then you become a seller of their product, who then gets the product at a discount.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   But some people, they join up with that just so they can simply consume the product.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   That is not Christianity.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   We benefit from the product, if you will, and then we share the product with others.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Why? Because we believe upon it.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   The best network marketers are always those who believe in the product.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   And if you do not believe in the product, you will not share it.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And it is that simple.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Why does not someone share it? They do not believe in the product.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   That is it.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   There is only one reason.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   You either hate people or you do not believe it.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   The only thing necessary to share the gospel is to believe the gospel.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   I am not sure why we do not. I know there is an enemy.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   David reminded me of this story this week.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   We were in Mexico once.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   We were there on vacation, but wherever we are, we are also on mission,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   because we are Christians and that is what Christians do.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   They are always on mission, regardless of their business, pleasure or mission.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   We are there on mission.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   We were eating dinner and the server came forward.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   The waitress came up and we had engaged with her.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Remember, engage, share, invite.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   We had engaged with her.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   "Hey, how long have you been here? How long have you lived here?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   How long have you worked here?"
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   We were talking. "Can we share some good news with you?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Can we share this truth with you about Jesus Christ?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   What do you think you have to do to get into heaven?"
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   She said, "You have to believe in God and you have to do these things."
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I said, "Do you think that is what the Bible teaches?"
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   She said, "I do not know."
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   I said, "Let me show you what the Bible teaches."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Ephesians 2.8.9, 1 John 5, 11-13.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   We walked through the scriptures.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   I said, "Did you know that Jesus Christ did everything on your behalf?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   That what your job is, your part is, you believe.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Right now, you can go and you can believe upon this truth and be with God forever."
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   This was her response. I want you to listen closely.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   This is what she said.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   "Wow. That is good news."
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That is what she said.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   The reason that she said it was good news is because it is unbelievably good news.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   I am not sure when we, porch goers, Christian friends, stopped believing that it was good news.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   People do not have to go to hell. They can be with God forever.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It is great news, man.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   It is amazing news.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Everyone that you share it with one day will realize that in sharing it with them, you were loving them.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Many of them will thank you in the kingdom.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Some of them will wish they had listened.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Everyone will be glad that you shared that truth with them.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   As the scripture says, "Apart from Christ, man is under condemnation of God."
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   That is Romans 5.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   "Apart from Christ, man is a slave to sin and in the snare of the devil."
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   That is John 8, verse 34.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   2 Timothy 2, verse 26.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   "Apart from Christ, we are object of God's wrath."
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Ephesians 2, verse 3.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   "Apart from Christ, man is cut off."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Colossians 1, verse 21.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   "Destined to die forever in the fires of hell."
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Mark 9.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   "In torment forever."
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Luke 16.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   "Ongoing destruction."
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   2 Thessalonians 1.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   "The smoke of sinners' torment goes up forever and ever without rest."
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Revelation 14.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   So how would we not share it?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Verse 14, he says,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   "How then can they call on the one they have not believed in?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And how can anyone preach unless they are sent as it is written,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the good news!'"
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   My second point is a simple one.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   They won't hear it unless you share it.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   They will not hear it unless you share it.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I've heard it asked many times when we wrestle with Christianity and theological truths.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   "What about those who never hear the gospel?"
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I've heard many pastors and myself have before.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   We go to Romans 1 and we say, "Hey, we show how the world declares God and awareness of God,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   and everyone knows their God, and if they see God, if they truly see God, they will find Him."
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And we go to all of these places.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   I don't anymore.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Somebody says, "What about those who have never heard the gospel?"
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I simply say, "What about those who have and don't share it with those who haven't?"
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   What does that mean?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   How does that happen?
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   How do we sit under this umbrella of question, "Well, what about those who never hear?"
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Well, what about the thousands, hundreds of thousands, billions who have heard
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   and feel no burden whatsoever to go share it with the two billion who haven't heard?
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Well, what about--that's a better question.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   What about those people?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Christianity is like a good infection.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   A disease, if you will, a good disease, if you will.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   How do you know if someone has a disease?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   You see the symptoms of that disease pouring from their life.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Whether it's a fever or boils or whatever, the symptoms of that disease,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   as you clearly see, they have it because they have the physical symptoms of it.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Just like Christianity, when someone becomes a Christianity,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   the good infection of Christianity, the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   that which indwells them, a disease, you have something in you working that is showing symptoms.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Likewise, Christianity, you have something in you, holy and good and perfect,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   that is working to show symptoms.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   The fruit of the Spirit bleed from your life.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control bleed from your life.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Oh, you got that disease. But also, like a disease, Christianity is contagious.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Like a contagious infection.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   How do you know if someone has a contagious infection?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Simply put, it spreads.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   How do you know if someone has the good infection of Christianity?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Simply put, it spreads.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   It is very, very, very contagious.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   If you are contagious, in fact, by being near a Christian, you will catch it.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   And this is where the metaphor breaks down, because I believe the church has begun to treat it like a disease.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   In fact, we're like, "Oh, man, he caught that Christianity thing."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Make sure we quarantine them in the church.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Now, bring them in the church, make them park cars and get in a community group and pray in the corner
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and read their Bibles over here, but don't let them out there.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   They might do something crazy.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Might start telling everyone about Jesus.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Keep them here in the church. Quarantine them nice and close here.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   May it never be, man.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   May it never be.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Speaking of diseases, I heard that some are afraid to go overseas with Ebola breakout
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and ISIS.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   My friends, these are reasons we go, not reasons we stay.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   These are reasons we go.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   This is what Christians have done since day one.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I will tell you that to do, I've heard it said, to do death-defying mission work,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   you must believe in the sovereignty of God, that is, that He's in control
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   and that you will not die one moment before the Lord has ordained.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And I will simply tell you that until God is done with you, you are immortal.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And if you're going to die, which I hate to break it to you, you are.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   What better way to die than in obedience?
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And answering a call to Him, I was with our senior pastor the other day,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and this is what pastors talk about when they're at lunch.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   He said, "What would you do if ISIS captured you and put a knife to your throat
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and said, 'We're going to cut off your head.'"
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   And the rest of us stopped and thought for a second.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   My pastor responded like he had thought about it and said,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "I would take off my shirt and I would hand it to them."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And I said, "You need to take this before it gets bloody,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   for the winter is coming and the nights are cold here.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   In the name of Jesus, this is yours."
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And I heard that and I'm like, "I think that's what Jesus would do."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   I think you've got the question right.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And I was thinking jujitsu in my mind, but you win.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Jim Elliot said this, "When it comes time to die,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   make sure all you have to do is die."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Maybe you don't know who Jim Elliot is.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   In his 20s, he had heard of a tribe, the Wahodani tribe in Ecuador,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   who were an unreached people group.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And he began to use all of his brain power and all of his gifts
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   and all of his talents to make his life mission to be sure
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   that the Wahodani tribe heard about Jesus before he died.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And he studied here and then eventually got on a boat,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   traveled to Ecuador, lived in an area for a year
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   as he learned the language, then moved to a tribe closer
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   to where he learned some specific phrases of the Wahodani tribe.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Just to tell you a little bit about this tribe,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   they were a very interesting group.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   There was an oil rig near there.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   They had killed all the oil workers and so the oil well was abandoned.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   There was another tribe around them that had trusted in Christ
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   and began to share the gospel with them.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   They killed every single one of them.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Anyone who came into their territory, they speared to death.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   And so Jim Elliot and four of his friends made it their life mission
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   to make sure they heard about Jesus.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And so they got a plane and they figured out how to lower gifts
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   down to the Wahodani people.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And so they would lower food down to them in this bucket from this plane.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And they were very successful.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   In fact, eventually the Wahodani began to give them gifts back in the bucket.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And when they did that, they thought, "Okay, it's time. We can go."
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And so they found a place to land the plane near the Wahodani people on a beach.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And they got there and the plane went and told the tribal people
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   that they were there, "Please go see them."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   A man and two women went and saw them.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   They had dinner together. It went very well.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   They were very excited that this tribe was going to hear about Jesus.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Three days later, they saw two other women on the shore.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   They quickly went to them.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   As they got closer, they realized that the women were not friendly.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   In fact, when they turned around, they saw that they were surrounded
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   by Wahodani warriors holding spears in the air.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Jim Elliot had a revolver on him.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   He went to reach for it and then realizing that they had committed
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   not to kill anyone who had not heard about Jesus.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   For they were sure where they would go, but they had not heard about Christ.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Jim Elliot was unsuccessful.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   He died in that moment by spear with four of his friends.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   His wife, Elizabeth Elliot, waited for the call that weekend.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Never got it. Weeks went by.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   They got concerned. It became a nationwide issue.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   The United States of America sent people to recover their bodies.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   They buried their bodies on the beach there.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Elizabeth Elliot then studied here for a year, got on a plane,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and returned to the Wahodani people.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   In the name of Jesus Christ, she told them that they had killed her husband
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   and that she was here to make sure they knew about Jesus.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   The entire tribe converted.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   It's one of the greatest missionary stories ever known to man.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Apart from the apostle Paul, Jim Elliot is potentially one of the greatest missionaries
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   apart from the apostles.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Thousands have been spurred on by his story.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Thousands tonight are spurred on by his story.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   More than 50 years later, some of you are like, "Yeah, but he died."
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   No, Jim Elliot lived more than any of us ever will.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   He lived out his mission. He lived out his calling on his life.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   God's calling on his life.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It's important to say now, just to make sure your theology is accurate,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   that the Lord does not need you.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   No, God can make the rocks cry out indeed.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   He does not need you, but if he made the rocks cry out,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   it would only be because of our disobedience.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   It would only be because of our apathy.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   It would only be because we were not faithful.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   In fact, there are 4,083 unreached people groups as a result of our unfaithfulness,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and as a result of our disobedience.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Verse 16, "But not all the Israelites accepted the good news,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   and the message is heard through the word about Christ."
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Literally, the message concerning Christ in the Greek.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   "But I ask, did they not hear?"
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Of course they did.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   "Their voice has gone out into all the earth,
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   their words to the ends of the world."
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   What's happening here is Paul is addressing an objection
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   that the Israelites, or God's people, the Jews, have not heard the gospel.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Paul is saying, "No, they have heard it because we shared it."
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   They have heard it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   "We were a fork in the road.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Those who have rejected it have rejected it upon hearing it,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   but they have heard it."
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   My third and final point this evening is simply that success in missions
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   is measured by sharing.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Success in missions is measured by sharing.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Success in missions is measured by sharing,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   not converting, but sharing,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   that you would share the gospel.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   See, God is in charge of who accepts it.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   You're in charge of sharing it.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   God's in charge of saving.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   In fact, I'll illustrate it like this.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   If there were two mission trips, two international--
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   we call them short-term discipleship trips because everything we do is missions.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   If there were two trips, people go overseas,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   the first trip, they share the gospel 50 times and 40 trust in Christ,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   we would celebrate that.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   If in the second trip they shared the gospel 400 times
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   and four trusted in Christ,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I'm telling you that the second trip was more successful
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   because our responsibility is sharing the gospel.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   God is in charge of saving people.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Your responsibility is sharing.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   God's responsibility is saving,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   and he's really, really, really good at it.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   He's really, really good at doing his part,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   and this means that you cannot get frustrated
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   at your unbelieving father or your unbelieving boss,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   that instead of frustrations, you pray,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   you pray like their eternity depended on it because it does.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But tonight is not just about sharing the gospel
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   but about taking it to people who haven't heard it,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   all the ends of the earth.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   The gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   the first books of the New Testament,
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   are written about Jesus' life.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   That's why we call them the gospels,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and they all end the same way,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   not with the resurrected Christ,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   but with the resurrected Christ calling the people closest to him
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   who have believed upon him to go and share this story to the ends of the earth.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   That's how the gospels end.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   In fact, in Matthew 28, we see what's called the great commission,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and I love that we use the word mission
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   like we're soldiers on a mission,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   like this is the mission, and not just the mission,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   but the commission that someone else is going with us,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   our captain, God Almighty, he goes with us,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   he's with us, this is what the great commission says.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   "Then the 11 disciples went to Galilee,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   "to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   "When they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   "Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   "'has been given to me.'"
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   What an amazing statement.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   "and surely I am with you always,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   "to the very end of the age that God goes with you.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   "As you share his truth, he is with you.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   "Giving you the words, he is with you.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   "You always choose your last words carefully.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   "Jesus is no exception.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   "He used his last words to send the disciples out into the world
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   "on the greatest mission this world has ever known.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   "And because of their obedience, you sit here tonight."
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Christianity has exploded and spread throughout the world,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   spreading west, eventually reaching the Americas.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   It's this infectious disease that has reached itself
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   to your ears tonight.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Maybe you're hearing it for the first time this evening,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   but this is what has happened as a result of these 12 guys,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   11 of which died horrific deaths,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   one of which was tortured before he died,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   all for the sake that you might know who Christ is.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   This is our example that we might go and do the same.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   The gospel has spread.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And let me say this.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Let me speak to my nominal believers in the room,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   those of you that simply attend church on Sunday,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   or maybe you don't,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   or maybe even the non-believers in the room,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   those that have yet to trust in Christ,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   If you don't know my story,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   if we're meeting each other for the first time this evening,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   I've not always been a Christian,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   though I was raised in the church.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   College was rebellious for me,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   and I will tell you,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   from experience, the sin robs you of creativity.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   It was like the same thing over and over and over.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Every weekend, every Monday, I would live for Thursday,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   so that I would get drunk on Thursday,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   cruise Thursday night into Friday,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   get extremely drunk on Friday.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   That would carry me through Saturday,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   so that I might wake up on Sunday
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   with a hangover beside some stranger, typically.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And the greatest trip, the greatest journey,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   as a non-Christian, it came every year,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   was to Sal Padre on spring break.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   That we would go down to Sal Padre,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   we would sit next to some muddy water,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   kind of called a beach,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   and we would drink a lot of beer out of a funnel
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   next to a bunch of coeds around our age.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And that was what life was.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   I thought it was awesome.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   I thought that was the epitome
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   of pleasure and satisfaction, sin of life.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Sin robs you of creativity, like what a joke.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Nearly two years after becoming Christian,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   I found myself not in Sal Padre, but South Africa.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Sitting with a Maasai warrior,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   as he showed me his house,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   and I told him about Jesus.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   And what I'm telling you, frankly,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   non-believing friends, is you're getting ripped off.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   You have not yet found life.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   And I'm telling you that boldly,
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   as someone who's snorted lines from a mirror,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and bonged beers, or whatever you think life is,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   you are getting ripped off.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   'Cause you haven't found it yet.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And I'd love to share it with you tonight.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   If you have not heard it yet,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   if it has not hit your heart yet, let's talk.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Jesus is clearly, as clearly as he can,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   telling us to go, and to find the people
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   who do not know him, and tell him.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   And I'm asking you, can you think of a greater mission?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Our question tonight is, why haven't we gone?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Why haven't we gone?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   There's gonna be some opportunities for you
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   as soon as the message wraps up.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   I know Fort Worth, Garrett's gonna circle you up
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   and talk to you about an opportunity in Haiti
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   at Mission of Hope, and here in Dallas,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   there in the loft, we're gonna talk about Ethiopia and Haiti.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   If you have any interest in even gaining information,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   I would urge you to go there.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   There's a simple application tonight,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I wanna make sure everyone hears it.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   It is to get on a plane and go somewhere,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   and if for any reason you can't,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   it is to give to those who can.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   That's it, that you would go somewhere
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   and share the gospel with someone who needs to hear it.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Okay, certainly, asterisk,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   certainly with your neighbor first.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Okay, and as you're faithful,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   sharing the gospel with your neighbor,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   and in your supermarket, and in your Starbucks,
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   and at work, that you would get on a plane
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   and you would go somewhere,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   and you would share it with someone who hasn't heard it.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   And if you hear that and you're like,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   I don't have vacation days,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   or I can't do that for some reason,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   or for whatever it is,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   that you would give to those who can
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   and make it possible for them to do that.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And we're not taking up an offering,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   that's not us, man, that's for you to find the need
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   and for you to meet the need on your own.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Okay, that's the simple application this evening.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Have you guys seen,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   there's this thing that's been repeated in movies.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   It's, like, I think, "Act of Valor."
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Have you seen "Act of Valor?"
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Does that connect with anyone?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   The SEAL Team Six has just kind of been, like,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   thwarted in the cinema lately, right?
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   And so, we see these Navy SEALs.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   You've seen this scene,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   whether you've seen "Act of Valor" or not.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   It looks like this.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   There's these soldiers and they're on a base,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and they're kind of doing ordinary things.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   What I mean by that is they're jogging in sweats,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   or they're working out, or they're playing chess,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   or they're giving each other a hard time
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   about each other's girlfriends,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and they're just kind of talking smack,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   and they're just doing ordinary things, right?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   That's one scene.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You see the soldiers, they're in sweats,
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   they're just kind of doing ordinary things.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Scene two, the captain brings everyone together in a room,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   and there's a whiteboard, typically,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   or some sort of slide or projector or something,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   and he begins to give the mission.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   "Okay, guys, hey, you ready?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   "This is what we've been training for.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   "We're gonna go now.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   "I found the bad guy.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   "We're gonna go get the bad guy.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   "You ready on mission?"
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And then scene three, usually it cuts to this scene
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   where these same superhuman, almost, dudes
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   are walking around in camo, carrying AR-15s with helmets,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   and their face shield is down,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   and they're usually crawling up the back of some helicopter,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   ready to do work.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   You seen it?
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   You guys nod your heads if you've seen this,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   or if you fell asleep, like, elbow your neighbor or something.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   You guys seen this?
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You guys seen it?
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Can you imagine with me for just one moment?
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Okay, same scene, dudes in sweats,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   running, jogging, playing chess, hanging out.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Captain says, "Hey, come together.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   "Hey, we're gonna go get the bad guy.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   "We're gonna go on mission."
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Scene three, back in sweats, jogging, hanging out,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   playing chess.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Captain comes, "Hey, what are we doing?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   "Did you not hear the mission?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   "Did you not hear what we're going to do?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   "Did you not hear?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   "This is what we've been training for."
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   "Cool, Captain, I'm good, man.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   "Go work on my bench press, okay, I'm good.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   "Like, y'all have fun."
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   "And this is what we've done."
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Jesus said, "Gather soldiers,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   "for there is a mission."
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Simply put, it is I want you to go into the world
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   and teaching them the very things that I've taught you,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   baptizing them in the name of the Father
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   and lo, I will be with you always to the very end of the age.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   You guys ready?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   Ready, break.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Get suited up, grab your AR-15s, and let's do work.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Ah, Jesus, we're good.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   We're good, man.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   I'm just gonna wait for your return.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Somebody else will do that.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Man, I'm gonna be in Dallas,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   I'm gonna be in Fort Worth or Houston
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   or somewhere else around America,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   just getting comfortable,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   building my kingdom, but we're good, Jesus.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   No, I'll read my Bible every now and then, I'll pray,
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   even go to church on Sunday, we're good.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Just leave me alone, don't ask much of me.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   That ain't the gospel, friends.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   That ain't the gospel.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Let me pray specifically that we would hear
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   and understand the gospel.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Father, we cannot without you.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Lord, we come to you in the name of Jesus.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Yeshua, Isa, Jezis,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Yeshu, Disas, Jezus, Jesus,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Isas, Jezus, Isus, Disus,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Isa, Lisao, Sai,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   Father, may his name be preached in every language,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   in every tongue, to every nation.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Would you use this group in that way, God?
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Help us to reach them.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Amen.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It's our time.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   We must rise up and no longer disparage.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   It's our time, church, to honor our heritage.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   We have a Savior. He gave it all on the cross.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   We stand beside martyrs who counted nothing as loss.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   They took God's mysteries, opened them up for us.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Stephen, John the Baptist, Bonhoeffer, Jan Hus.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Surrounded by a cloud of witnesses above,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   it's now our turn to model his unending love.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Our mission is one we cannot confuse,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   nor muddy up with some trite excuse.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   You say you're not well-versed, ready, or able.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   I think Moses even tried to use that fable.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   The time we have, it's now more urgent.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   If we should hear, "Well done, faithful servant."
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Yeah, church, it's our time.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   It's our time to confess the ways we're mangled,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   the sins and selfishness that have us entangled.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Lust, greed, and pride, their path leads to the grave.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Yet we return to our sins as if we're a slave.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Can we survive in this putrid, dead sea?
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   I quote Paul, "May it never be."
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   So let's cast aside our individual leprosy
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   and begin to leave a biblical legacy.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   There's a glorious prize awaiting to be won,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   and the way to win is to start to run.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Let's lace them up and fight the good fight,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   become to the world both salt and light.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Our life on earth is merely a vapor.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Our chapter must move from pen to paper.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   So church, let's get to writing because it's our time.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It's our time, church.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   We have what it takes to help the world from its slumber awake.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   To Jesus we are his beautiful bride.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Whom shall we fear with him on our side?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   We have each other. We are not alone.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   It's iron to iron in the combat zone.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   There's a promise of life full of adventure.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   As long as we give both talents and treasure,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   the workers are few, the harvest is plenty,
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   with so many lives running on empty.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Scores of people trying to cope.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   They've come to the end of their proverbial rope.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Young eyes are wandering, looking for direction.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Make sure we point them to his resurrection.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   The clock's ticking. We're on our dime.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Hey, church, rise up!
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   It's our time!
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   It's our time.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   To Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to all the ends of the earth,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   I just need you to get it.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   All right?
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   The only people who share it are those who believe it,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   and those who believe it share it. They can't not.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   It's infectious.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   It's infectious.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   It's infectious.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
