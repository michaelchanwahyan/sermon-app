[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.240]   - All right, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.040]   friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.720]   Northwest Arkansas, Tulsa, Houston,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720]   wherever you are tuning in
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.120]   and joining from all over.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.280]   We are continuing the series, God Save the Queen,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.440]   as we explore the Old Testament book of the Bible
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.040]   on the life of Esther, named Esther, the queen,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340]   and the crazy story that is around her life.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.400]   Let me start by asking this,
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.280]   who is the greatest villain in any movie of all time?
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.680]   Joker?
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.060]   Darth Vader?
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.760]   Venom?
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.000]   In any great story, any great story has with it,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900]   man, you guys are really extra on this whole villain thing.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.540]   In any great story has a, The Bachelor, well, wow.
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.240]   In any great story has a villain involved in it,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.600]   and tonight we're gonna be introduced,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.560]   but here's some of the ones that I think
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.160]   are the most iconic villains of all time.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.200]   You got the Joker, of course,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.560]   then you got Bane, Darth Vader,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.260]   maybe the most classic, then Thanos,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.660]   then Scar, of course, and then Dr. Evil.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.360]   Of course, I've never seen, 'cause I'm a Christian, and.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.320]   But every great story has a villain involved in it,
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.560]   it has a hero, it has a villain,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.160]   it has a great storyline and great plot,
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.400]   and the story of Esther is no different,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.920]   and tonight we're gonna be introduced
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.160]   to the villain in this story,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   but unlike those other stories, this is a true story.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.640]   Let me catch you up in case you missed last week,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.080]   and it'll give us a little direction
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.920]   for where the evening will be.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.280]   The book of Esther is a story of a young girl
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.360]   who goes from a peasant to a princess, if you will.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.880]   It's a rags to riches story.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.920]   Last week, we looked at the first two chapters,
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.640]   where Esther, we're told, was this orphan girl
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.480]   that was adopted by her uncle,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.560]   and she ended up marrying King Xerxes,
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.080]   and King Xerxes was the ruler of the empire,
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.160]   the Persian Empire,
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.180]   greatest empire the world had ever seen,
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.440]   so we had these three characters,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.000]   Xerxes, Mordecai, and Esther,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.360]   so for Xerxes, think Jake Gyllenhaal, we said.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   There he is, still looking good.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.240]   Then you have Esther, I'm mixing it up this week,
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.440]   'cause nobody knew who Bella Hadid was,
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280]   and going with still Bella Hadid,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.740]   Gal Gadot, is that how you say that?
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.560]   Wonder Woman, however you say her name, Wonder Woman,
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.120]   and then, of course, Uncle Mordecai,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.440]   the most famous uncle of all time would be?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.320]   Uncle Jesse, keeping it real,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.720]   and tonight, we're gonna be introduced
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.000]   to our villain, whose name is Haman,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200]   and for that, I have selected Jafar.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.800]   One, because look at that guy,
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   number two, because it really fits,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   like Jafar was this prime minister, if you will,
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.960]   who kinda had the emperor or the sultan under his thumb.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.280]   Haman is no different,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.840]   and you'll understand what I mean by that,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.800]   but here's what's going on,
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.640]   so this all took place in the Persian Empire,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.900]   it's a true story, it's a real story,
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.580]   and the Persian Empire was ruled by King Xerxes.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.240]   He was a pagan, he didn't know God,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.220]   didn't worship God, he thought he was God, not a great guy.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.760]   He holds a beauty pageant and says,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.360]   "I'm gonna look for the most beautiful woman
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.580]   "in 127 states, anywhere from Egypt all the way to India,
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.180]   "I wanna find the most beautiful woman,"
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.400]   and Esther, this incredibly beautiful woman,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.800]   wins the beauty pageant and becomes
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   the queen of the entire empire,
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.320]   and this kinda takes place,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.600]   and she all of a sudden finds herself
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.320]   in the midst of the empire
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.780]   and set up for whatever God's gonna do,
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.800]   and the whole story showcases
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.680]   that even when you can't exactly see what God is doing,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.400]   you can rest assured he is at work.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.760]   So today, even though we're introduced to the villain here,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   it only is a part of God's plan
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.080]   and what God's gonna bring about
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.600]   despite the evil that is introduced in this story,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.660]   just like God's at work despite any evil
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.260]   that's introduced in any story.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.200]   So with that said, we're gonna be in Esther chapter three.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.000]   If last week was the Bachelor Persia edition,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.720]   this would be the making of a murderer,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.480]   if you will, if you saw that Netflix show,
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.060]   and we're gonna just see kinda how Haman became this guy
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.420]   who at one point wants to inflict genocide
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.200]   on all of the Jewish people.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.320]   Again, this is about 480 years before Jesus
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.000]   in what is modern day Iran.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.800]   Story continues.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.880]   Esther chapter three, verse one.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.880]   Now, sometime later, King Xerxes promoted Haman,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   the son of Hemathada, the Agagite,
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.760]   over all the other nobles,
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.580]   making him the most powerful official in the empire.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.000]   All the king's officials would bow down
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.240]   or lay prostrate to Haman to show him respect
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.760]   whenever he passed by, for the king had commanded.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   But Mordecai, who's Uncle Jesse, who's Esther's uncle,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.680]   who works at the king's gate,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.760]   refused to bow down or to show him respect.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.440]   The reason why, we're told in a few verses later,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.600]   is that he says, "I won't, out of my faith,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.940]   "bow down and worship any human person.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.880]   "So I don't care who you are, I'm not gonna do it."
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.680]   So every time that Haman would show up at work
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.120]   and he'd go to the front of the palace,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.140]   think about he's like entering the palace gates.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.000]   There's all the prison guards,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.120]   or there's all the guards, if you will, all the staff.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.600]   Everybody lays down and bows down
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.520]   except for one guy every single time, that's Mordecai.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.240]   Now, when Haman, verse five,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.000]   saw that Mordecai would not bow down or show him respect,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.220]   he was filled with rage, and he learned that Mordecai,
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.000]   he learned of his nationality, that he was Jewish.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.920]   So he decided it was not enough
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.480]   to lay hands on Mordecai alone.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.980]   Instead, he would look for a way to destroy all the Jews
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.300]   throughout the entire empire of Xerxes.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.760]   So he goes from, "I'm not just gonna take this guy out.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.700]   "The fact that his Jewish faith won't let him bow down,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.280]   "I'm gonna take all of them out."
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.160]   Long before Hitler was ever around,
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.520]   this is the first person,
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.440]   or at least one of the first people
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.460]   that wanted to completely annihilate
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.060]   the Jewish race and Jewish people.
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.360]   Throughout history, there's been a lot of times
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.900]   people have done this, quickly side note.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.780]   And part of the reason is because there's a satanic
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.460]   or an evil force out there.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.820]   So people over and over have tried
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.300]   to annihilate the Jewish people
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.420]   because God promised that through the Jewish people
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.940]   would come a Messiah to save the world.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.220]   So if you could take out the Jewish people,
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.800]   you would take out the Jewish Messiah that was to come.
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.180]   So that was what was driving or behind Haman's actions.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.540]   That he wants a full genocide on these guys.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.500]   So he comes in the month of April
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.780]   during the 12th year of King Xerxes reign.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.960]   Lots were cast in Haman's presence.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.360]   And the lots were called perem.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.480]   We're gonna come back to that in a second.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.840]   To determine the best day and month to take action.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.920]   And the day selected was March 7th, nearly a year later.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.720]   So kind of random side note, but basically he's like,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.080]   "Dude, we're gonna take all these guys out.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.040]   "I'm prime minister.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   "I'm gonna put together a plan."
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.260]   But he did something that was common then.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.460]   It's not really common now where he's like,
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.360]   "How do I decide which day on the calendar?
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.580]   "Let's roll the dice."
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.800]   And so they rolled the dice and the dice came out
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.340]   with a day, the dice being called perem,
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.780]   and a day that was almost a year later in March.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.860]   And we're told that he marks the calendar.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.100]   This is gonna be the day.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.260]   Now he gets his plan, goes to the king.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.140]   Says, "I got the day picked.
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.580]   "Now I gotta go convince the king
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.740]   "to let me kill this people."
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.900]   Here's what happens.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.580]   Then Haman approached King Xerxes.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.860]   He said, "There is a race of people
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.800]   "scattered all throughout the provinces of your empire,
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.100]   "all throughout the states,
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.140]   "and they keep themselves separate from everyone else.
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.420]   "Their laws are different from those of many other people.
[00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.240]   "They refuse to obey the laws of the king,
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.580]   "as in to worship me.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.860]   "So it's not in the king's interest to let them live.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.580]   "If it pleases the king,"
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.640]   again, this is why I say he's Jafar,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.820]   "let him issue a decree that they be destroyed,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.620]   "and I will give you 10,000 large sacks of silver
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.320]   "to the government administrators
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.500]   "to be deposited in the royal treasury."
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   That 10,000 large sacks of silver
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.880]   would be today equivalent to $280 billion.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.620]   The entire GDP of the empire at that time was 15,000.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.620]   I mean, it's a huge empire.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.620]   And he says, "Look, hey, we're gonna basically almost double.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.920]   "That's what I'm gonna guarantee to you."
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.020]   So the king, who, if you know anything about history,
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.620]   at this point in time, Xerxes, movie 300,
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.100]   he just lost Thermopylae.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.380]   He just lost those 300 dudes
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.820]   who'd been doing a lot of crossfit.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.660]   He lost those guys, and he's like,
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.540]   "Man, I need some more cash and some people."
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.180]   And so, of course, he's like, "Yeah, let's do it.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.320]   "If you can give me that much money,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.400]   "I don't care who they are,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.100]   "and it sounds like you got a good plan."
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.980]   So the king sent dispatches all over the country
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.020]   who were sent by swift messengers
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.500]   into all of the provinces of the empire,
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.660]   giving the order that all Jews, both young and old,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.940]   including women and children, must be killed,
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.020]   slaughtered, and annihilated on a single day.
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.140]   This was scheduled to happen
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.980]   on March 7th of the next year.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.800]   The property of the Jews would be given
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.840]   to whoever kills them.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.980]   It's crazy.
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.140]   It's terrible.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.260]   No matter their age, I want you to spread
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.540]   in everywhere, in every state,
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.660]   in all the different languages the empire represented.
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.340]   They would have people and messengers that went in,
[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.540]   and whatever language you spoke,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.140]   they nailed on the telephone poles of that day.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.060]   Here's the edict, and here's what's gonna happen.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.080]   On this day in March, every person who is Jewish
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.900]   is to be killed, and you can take any of their stuff.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.060]   It's like a twisted, old-school version
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.460]   of the Purge or something.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.660]   So all the Jews throughout the land
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.960]   are, of course, terrified.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.780]   When Mordecai learned, because Mordecai's Jewish
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.500]   just like Esther is, when he learned
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.780]   about all that had been done, he tore his clothes.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.540]   He put on burlap and ashes, and he went out into the city
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.300]   crying with a loud and bitter wail.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.420]   So Mordecai's going around.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.240]   He's crying.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.080]   He's weeping.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.460]   We're told the Jewish people are going around crying
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.740]   and weeping, that they know, like, man, this is,
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.540]   basically, I need to arrange a funeral
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.180]   for me and my whole family, and the whole empire,
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.340]   and especially the city of Susa,
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.580]   we're told, is thrown into confusion.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.580]   When Esther, Queen Esther's maids and eunuchs
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.180]   came and told her, your Uncle Mordecai is weeping,
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.380]   and he's wearing burlap, which is not a good look
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.780]   for anybody, and crying all throughout the city,
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.640]   and she doesn't know what's going on at this point.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.240]   Remember, she had hidden her Jewish identity.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.580]   The king didn't know she was Jewish.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.580]   Very few people did, but she hears, like,
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.800]   hey, your uncle is just, like, wailing and weeping
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.340]   all around the city, and so she decides.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.120]   She was deeply distressed, so she sent clothing to him
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.840]   to replace the burlap.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.880]   I love that.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.080]   This is a classic lady move.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.880]   Girl's voice sad.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.120]   I know it cheers me up.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.040]   I'm gonna send him some new, fresh outfit,
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.600]   some new clothes, some retail therapy.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.260]   Here's a gift card of Neiman's, whatever you have back then,
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.900]   and we're told Mordecai refuses it.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.380]   So then he sends word of the queen,
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.660]   and basically he's like, hey, don't you know
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.500]   what's happened?
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.240]   And he sends a copy, we're told, of the edict.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.700]   Like, takes one off the telephone pole.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.220]   Hey, send this, and gets a servant,
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.500]   and he sends it over to Queen Esther,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.900]   and she sees what's happening, and he says,
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.420]   go in and plead for the life of your people.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.980]   Go to the king and plead for the life of your people.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.020]   And she says, you don't know what you're asking me to do.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.900]   You realize that would be a death wish.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.220]   At that point in time, you could not just approach the king,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.260]   even if he's your husband.
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.000]   You could not go in unless you invited to see the king.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.660]   Anyone who did so, who didn't get the royal scepter
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.780]   extended, would lose their life.
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.200]   It says this.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.260]   Then Esther told Hathak, who's the servant,
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.720]   kinda going back and forth between them,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.260]   go back and relay this message to Mordecai.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.900]   All the king's officials, and even the people
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.500]   in the provinces know anyone who appears before the king
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.660]   in his inner court without being invited is doomed to die,
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.940]   unless the king holds out the golden scepter.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.740]   I can't just go in there and plead, Mordecai.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.040]   It'd be a death sentence.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.740]   And the king has not called for me in 30 days.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.780]   As in, we know this king had hundreds of women in a harem.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.620]   He's not sleeping alone at night, and he's gone 30 days
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.380]   since he called his wife in the last time.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.740]   She's basically going, I'm not sure this is a great time
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.660]   for me to approach him, if you will.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.560]   We're not exactly jiving right now.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.100]   So she sends that message back to Mordecai,
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.100]   and Mordecai responds with this message.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.700]   Mordecai sent this reply to Esther.
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.740]   "Don't think for a moment that because you're in the palace,
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.140]   "you will escape when all the other Jews are killed.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.980]   "If you keep quiet, at a time like this,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.300]   "deliverance and relief will come from the Jews,
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   "come for the Jews, and it will arise from some other place,
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.280]   "but you and your relatives will die," Mordecai says.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.940]   If you keep quiet, you're either gonna die
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.760]   because the king doesn't extend the scepter,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.680]   or you're gonna die because of this edict,
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.500]   but God's gonna save his people,
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.220]   even if it doesn't involve you.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.100]   Who knows, one of the most iconic verses in the book,
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.100]   verse 14, "Who knows if perhaps you were made queen
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.520]   "for such a time as this?"
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.160]   Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.260]   "Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.920]   "and fast for me.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.580]   "Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.900]   "My maids and I will do the same.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.400]   "And then though it is against the law,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.480]   "I will go in to see the king,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.440]   "and if I must die, I must die."
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.400]   So Mordecai went away, and he did everything
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.540]   that Esther had ordered him.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.500]   We're gonna hit pause and continue the story
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.460]   of exactly what happens next next week.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.860]   But I really wanna camp out on these last few verses
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.700]   because we see an exchange and an interaction
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.100]   that is related to Mordecai seeing and saying,
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.400]   "You've gotta connect the dots, Esther.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.780]   "All the things that seem so random,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.840]   "and how'd you go from the present to the princess,
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.980]   "or a peasant to the princess in just a moment or a day,
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.080]   "in such a short time period,
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.360]   "it was clearly God was always at work.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.880]   "Can't you see?
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   "Could it be that you've been put where you are
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.200]   "for such a time as this?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.000]   "Don't miss out on fulfilling the purpose
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.660]   "for which you're in that palace."
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.400]   And I wanna look and observe really three things
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.040]   as it relates to this idea of purpose
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.520]   that we learn from Esther's story and this interaction
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.600]   and really her life and her actions here.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.660]   Because all of us came to the room,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.220]   and one thing, that somewhere in your heart of hearts,
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.280]   whether or not you'd even admit it,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.840]   there's part of you that deeply desires
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.400]   to live a life that's full of purpose.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.580]   In other words, no matter how successful any of us become,
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.220]   no matter how well we do in our jobs,
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.600]   no matter how well we do in our careers,
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.200]   no matter what type of car you drove,
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.520]   or what type of house you have someday,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.480]   or how many kids you have,
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.360]   no matter whatever you define as success,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.200]   if it doesn't involve a life of significance,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.760]   like, "Dude, my life mattered,"
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.520]   we're a waste.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.560]   And the good news is God is deeply concerned
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   about you experiencing your purpose
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   and the reason that he has you on this planet.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.000]   And so there's three things that we learn
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.360]   from the interaction that they have here
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.280]   as it relates to you realizing your purpose.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.120]   'Cause some of the stuff that was true for her is very true,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.800]   or these three truths are not just true for her,
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.160]   they're true for you and true for me.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.920]   The first one, as it relates to purpose,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.240]   if you're taking notes,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.500]   is this idea that you and your life
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.120]   has been shaped on purpose.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.480]   Like, he's looking at the queen and he's going,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.580]   "Hey, could it be, Esther?
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.560]   "I mean, think about it.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.880]   "You're the queen in the palace.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.060]   "God has shaped your life.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.440]   "This is your moment.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.040]   "You're not there for some random reason
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.960]   "or to build your palace or just to have access
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.220]   "to whatever the king's clothes
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.480]   "and whatever lifestyle is there.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.520]   "You're there on purpose, don't miss it.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.620]   "Your life has been shaped on purpose."
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.040]   How was Esther's life shaped?
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.560]   Like, God shaped, he was involved in the details
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.200]   and who she was and forming her story
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.640]   and the way that she looked.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.400]   He was over all of that.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.200]   We're told that she was a woman of incredible beauty.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   That wasn't something that she chose or got to decide.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.920]   It was because God was involved in shaping her story.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.840]   And one of the ways that he shaped her
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.280]   was that he gave her incredible beauty.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.280]   We're told in Esther chapter two, verse seven,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.040]   it says the same thing two different times.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.320]   Or it highlights, it goes out of the way
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.080]   in a way that I don't know of another place in scripture
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.720]   where it says both of the things it says.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.040]   This young woman, Esther, had a lovely
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.120]   or really good figure and was beautiful,
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.220]   or your translation may say beautiful to look at.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.280]   The author goes out of the way and be like,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.080]   "Dude, this girl had a good body
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.400]   "and she had a really pretty face.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.120]   "She was thick with two Cs
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.840]   "and that's the type of girl this was."
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.280]   And God was over that.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.580]   That God had formed and shaped and he really put together.
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.920]   You can't take responsibility for that.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.680]   You're the most beautiful woman in 127 provinces.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.600]   Think about that.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.640]   You can't take responsibility.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.880]   You think that's just random?
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.000]   All of that was because God was shaping you
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.800]   on purpose for a purpose.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.320]   In fact, even her story in the same verse,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.760]   it says that Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.520]   when her father and mother had died.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.880]   A tragic moment where she buries both of her parents
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.280]   and she goes to live with her uncle
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.860]   in the city of Susa, the king.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.200]   And God was over all that
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.880]   and he was shaping and bringing about.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.280]   And all of a sudden he places the most beautiful woman,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.240]   maybe the king or anyone at that point had ever seen.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.260]   And he puts her in the city next to the king.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.360]   God was over all of it.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.880]   Can't you see, Esther,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.040]   your life has been shaped on purpose.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.000]   Your life.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.060]   Those listening right now and everybody in the room,
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.120]   your life has been shaped on purpose.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.320]   I don't know that you're actually gonna believe
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.240]   when I say that, like your story, how you look,
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.640]   the gifts that you have, your personality,
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.960]   the talents, the way that you think.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.080]   All of it maybe has been touched and impacted by sin
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.240]   as sin always does.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.300]   But God was intimately involved in shaping
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.820]   and is shaping your story.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.300]   You have been shaped on purpose for a purpose.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.840]   My daughter, I have a one and a half year old daughter
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.320]   named Monroe.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.160]   And I think there's a picture of her.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.940]   There she is, just cardigan and all, three dolls deep.
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.120]   She's ready for church.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.880]   And she loves this game that's like this shapes game.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.120]   It looks like this game, this is just what you do
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.480]   whenever you have kids, one year olds and kids.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.880]   You sit around, you do these shapes.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.960]   What's the point of the game?
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   Take that little star right there.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.400]   And there's a little star hole.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.360]   It's a pretty simple game.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.000]   I can't believe I'm explaining this right now.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.280]   But you take it and then you put it in this star hole.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.120]   It's not as simple as you would think for a one year old.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.200]   Shockingly, she doesn't conceptually get it.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.320]   So she just thinks any of those are kind of generic
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.760]   and I'll put them wherever I want.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.440]   And if not, and she is like, she's like an Enneagram eight.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.240]   So she gets like very, very lit when things
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.200]   don't go her way.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.280]   And she's throwing the thing up against the wall
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.120]   because she just wants the circle to fit in the star
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.680]   and vice, and she doesn't conceptually understand
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.520]   the point of the game.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.380]   You take the shape that most resembles the hole
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.680]   that it can plug into and you put it in there.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.400]   That's really what as Christians, we believe God
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.800]   has called us to in life.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.000]   You take the shape of your life, who you are,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.440]   how God has made you, how he's formed you,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   the gifts he's given you, and you plug into the holes
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.080]   of the problems in the world around us.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.400]   You plug into the holes of the needs of the body of Christ.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.200]   You take the shape, which is who you are.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.160]   That's a star, like how God has formed you.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.480]   And you look for ways to take the way that he's wired you,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.240]   who you are, what you bring to the table.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.600]   And I'm gonna be a part of meeting and bringing solutions
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   to problems in our world, to meeting and bringing solutions
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.960]   to problems at the church.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.600]   And by shape, what do I mean by that?
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.160]   There's an acronym that actually lays out,
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.000]   'cause people ask all the time,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.360]   like what am I supposed to do with my life?
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.820]   How do I know what God's calling me to do?
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.040]   I wanna give you a handhold, five letters.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.560]   It actually spells out the word shape
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.420]   because you have been shaped by God.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.080]   Each one of these reflects just a different way
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.640]   that you've been wired on purpose, for a purpose.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.640]   That'll give you some indication,
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.200]   man, maybe this is what I'm supposed to do.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.240]   The first one is S, stands for your spiritual gifts.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.800]   God has given, if you're a Christian,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.480]   speaking specifically to Christians,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.840]   in a way that I don't have time to go into,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.440]   when you trust in Jesus, the Holy Spirit comes in your life
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.660]   and it's like they begin to flame up
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.240]   or magnify different gifts
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.760]   that may have been there all along,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.300]   but he just pours gasoline on it and the fire gets bigger.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.880]   So there's spiritual gifts that God has brought about
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.720]   inside of your life.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.800]   Romans chapter 12 says this in verse four through eight.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.280]   "For each of us has one body with many members.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.160]   "And these members do not all have the same function."
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.760]   So it's like I got a body, I got hands, feet,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.360]   everybody has one of those, that's what he's saying.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.280]   So in Christ, we, though many, as Christians,
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.000]   form one body.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.800]   Each member belongs to all the others.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.960]   We have different gifts,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.880]   according to the grace given to each of us.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.220]   And then he lifts out some of them,
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.400]   it's not an exhaustive list, but he basically says,
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.840]   hey, if your gift is this, then do it.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.960]   If your gift is this, do it.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.760]   If your gift is prophesying or speaking
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.200]   a word of encouragement,
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.860]   then prophecy in accordance with your faith.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.940]   If it's serving, then serve.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.280]   If it's teaching, then teach.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.500]   If it's encouragement, then encourage.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.860]   If it's giving, then give generously.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.360]   If it's to lead, do it diligently.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.940]   If it's to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.340]   The first thing, how do I know what God's calling me to?
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.620]   You need to know your spiritual gift.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.500]   Like what is the thing that, man, I'm just like, why?
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.180]   This gives me life.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.900]   People in my life affirm it.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.980]   I think it adds value to the body of Christ
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.900]   'cause that's the point of the gifts that are there.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.540]   If you're interested in finding what yours are
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.080]   and you've never taken either some assessment,
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.980]   then they help you.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.180]   You can go to watermark.org/porchspiritualgifts.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.460]   Watermark.org, there it is,
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.140]   forward slash porch spiritual gifts, the first one.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.380]   So how do I know my shape?
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.500]   How have I been shaped on purpose?
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.340]   What's God calling me to?
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.220]   The second one is a heart.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.040]   So S-H, what are you passionate about?
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.500]   Like each of us has different passions
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.260]   and sometimes that gives us an indication that,
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.780]   hey, maybe that's a way that God is calling me
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.100]   to further use my time, my energy.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.860]   Like I just, I lose sleep over that
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.480]   and I get so excited about being a part of that.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.800]   Maybe you have a heart for sex trafficking.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.780]   Dallas is one of the most sex trafficked cities
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.380]   in the country and you could join some of our friends
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.600]   that serve here at the porch
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.960]   that started a ministry called Reclaimed.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.760]   That's all about fighting sex trafficking in the city.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.220]   Maybe you have a heart for just international ministry
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.520]   and it looks like you joining us on an international trip
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.080]   where you go and get to be a part of our trips
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.320]   to Ethiopia or El Salvador and different places that we go
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.640]   and try to bring the message of Jesus.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.080]   Maybe you have just a heart for inner city
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.760]   and man, there's so many different things
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.300]   that different partnerships and ministries
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.620]   where God has given us an opportunity to be a part.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.920]   Dallas has one of the highest
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.200]   and so many of the cities listening
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.160]   have some of the highest poverty rates in the country.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.280]   And as the body of Christ,
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.720]   we think that is our responsibility.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.540]   We're gonna push back darkness anywhere that it's found.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.720]   We're gonna fight for children who don't have parents
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.960]   to fight for them.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.400]   And we wanna be a part of bringing life and health
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.200]   to the place in which we live.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.280]   I don't know what breaks your heart
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.480]   or what gets you passionate.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.840]   You're like, dude, I would just go all day about that.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.680]   But that's a question.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.840]   So what is your spiritual gifts?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.200]   What are you passionate about?
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.480]   What abilities has God given you?
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.420]   That's the A, shape.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.080]   What abilities, what talents has God given you?
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.200]   Some of you, you're gifted in construction
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.040]   and you need to think through,
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.720]   like man, how can I use the construction?
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.560]   This is what I do.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.520]   I do nine to five.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.600]   I make a great living.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.000]   And how can I use the gifts that God has given me
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.120]   to be a part of bringing about transformation
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.760]   for the sake of Christ in the city in which I live?
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.920]   'Cause you can do all kinds of things
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.180]   and there's ways you can serve,
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.700]   but there may be unique ways
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.240]   that you could use construction gifts
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.800]   if that's the industry that you're in.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.300]   You could join our friends in Second Saturday,
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.160]   where every second Saturday here in this city,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.120]   they go and they help rebuild homes
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.920]   in high poverty areas of the city,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.320]   not for gain or financial gain,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.680]   but to be about transformation
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.160]   and giving people a second chance
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.400]   and getting them off their feet.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.680]   Maybe you're like, dude, I don't know.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.920]   I'm not very good at construction.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.360]   I don't know what I bring to the table.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.200]   I'm an accountant.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.320]   I'm just good at math.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.140]   You could be a part of mentoring kids through Mercy Street,
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.000]   which is a partnership ministry that's in South Dallas
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.120]   where tons of kids need tutoring.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.420]   And furthermore, you get a chance
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.560]   to be a reparenting mechanism,
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.640]   a source of love, encouragement,
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.480]   somebody who changes the trajectory of someone's life.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.600]   And the gifts that you have,
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.760]   whatever they are, God has given you
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.480]   so that you would be a part of living on purpose
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.920]   'cause you've been shaped on purpose.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.280]   P, personality.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.280]   What is your wiring?
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.600]   So God, you need to evaluate,
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.800]   and what are my spiritual gifts?
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.640]   What's my heart?
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.460]   What am I passionate about?
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.300]   What abilities?
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.960]   Like what is talents and stuff do I bring to the table?
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.240]   And what's my personality?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.160]   Like God, how you were made has been woven intentionally.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.560]   God is not surprised by the fact that you're introverted
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.400]   or you're extroverted,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   and you need to begin to go, man, how could I best serve?
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.960]   Or what would make sense for me to serve
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.680]   and best do kingdom work?
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.480]   How can I be most effective for advancing the message
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.360]   and hope of Jesus to our world?
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.800]   In light of my wiring.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.560]   Like you may be extroverted,
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.280]   and for you, man, there's places where you could go
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.660]   and you're like, dude, crowds don't scare me.
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.120]   I'll get up there and I'd love to get the mic
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.280]   and be in front of the children,
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.320]   and I'll be out rallying and just crowds, it's galore,
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.980]   and I wanna be with the Pilar.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.440]   And that is a part of your personality.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.040]   And you should look for opportunities
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   where those things align or for you to serve
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.880]   and for you to do that.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.200]   And if you're introverted, there's no hope for you.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.040]   And so I'm sorry.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.760]   No, if that is it, dude, everybody,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.080]   everyone's all across the board.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.120]   And so for you, you may be like,
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.680]   hey, I don't wanna be with massive crowds,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.000]   but I wanna be in small groups.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.920]   I love having more intentional conversations
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.400]   in a smaller environment,
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.460]   whether that's a small group or a one-on-one.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.280]   If you're like, no, I can't talk to anybody, coronavirus.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.020]   We've even got a notes writing ministry.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.840]   You can write notes from home.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.800]   If you're that, and hopefully you're gonna work
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.400]   on being able to talk to people,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.640]   'cause that's pretty important,
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.160]   but whatever your personality is,
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.000]   God has shaped you that way.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.240]   And so leaning and asking the question,
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.120]   how can I be most effective?
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.600]   And then finally, your experience.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.720]   This is a big one.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.260]   Your experience and your story is a part
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.020]   of how God is shaping you for purpose.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.960]   Even the things that were not according to his will,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.880]   maybe things that were done a part of you
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.040]   that clearly weren't a part of his will.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.120]   Maybe it's sexual abuse.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.680]   Maybe it was an abortion decision that you were a part of.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.440]   None of those things are hindrances or problems for God
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.160]   to use and maximize and advance his kingdom through you.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.480]   They can be platforms.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.560]   Some of the best ministries we have around here
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.640]   are men and women who've experienced those things.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.540]   They're a part of our story,
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.520]   where sexual abuse was a part of their past,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   and now they're leading ministries
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.860]   and caring for other people who have that same thing.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.280]   Same thing with abortion.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   Someone made a decision at some point,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   and so if you're in the room and you're like,
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.360]   man, I can never tell someone about this.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.480]   Some of the most effective ministers of the gospel I know
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.100]   have that a part of their story.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.520]   Whatever your experience is, where you lived,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.480]   all of that, God has shaped and is a part
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.320]   of shaping you on purpose to have an impact for him.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.940]   Second thing we see from Esther,
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.600]   just like she was shaped in her story
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.520]   and involved being an orphan and being beautiful
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.920]   and brought about, is that she wasn't just shaped
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.440]   on purpose, she was placed on purpose, just like you are.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.200]   That God placed her in the palace.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.760]   He takes this woman and he plucks her
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.480]   out of wherever she was, out of her family's home,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.380]   he puts her in the capital city,
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.720]   and then he does a beauty contest
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.280]   and he places her on purpose in the palace,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.120]   and I love this, 'cause Mordecai sees
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   what so often we don't see.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.640]   Mordecai sees and he responds and he goes,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.080]   can't you see, Esther?
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.800]   What if it's not random?
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.280]   What if all the moments in your life
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.520]   that you felt like, well, this is just so crazy?
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.880]   I'm now standing with 400 other women,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.840]   I'm in a beauty contest, I'm told I can wear
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.200]   whatever I want and it's for a year,
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.560]   and now I'm in the palace, I didn't even think
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.100]   I'd ever get to go see the palace,
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.120]   now I'm living in one of the rooms in the palace
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.920]   waiting to meet the king,
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.620]   and then you win the beauty contest?
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.960]   Could it be?
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.840]   None of it was random, Esther.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.600]   Maybe God has made you queen for just such a time as this.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.640]   Don't miss your opportunity by failing to connect the dots
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   that he's put and placed you here on purpose.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.520]   And that purpose is not for you to just be in the palace
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.280]   to advance Xerxes' kingdom.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.800]   You're in the palace to advance God's kingdom.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.340]   And he connects the dots in a way that so many of us
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.280]   fail to actually connect the dots.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.440]   If I'm Esther in that moment,
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.320]   I don't know that I really think that it's clearly like,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.280]   oh, this is clearly God, I think what you and I
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.740]   probably generally think, I think it's kind of random.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.480]   Most of us, whenever we look at our job
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.340]   or we look where we live in our apartment complex,
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.300]   the family that we're a part of,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.480]   we don't always understand and really connect the dots.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.680]   No, you're there on purpose.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.040]   And you think, no, I'm not.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.680]   I'm on the second floor of the apartment building.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.000]   I tried to get on the first floor.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.600]   I'm still trying to get on the first floor
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.360]   and it's definitely not on purpose.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.600]   If anything, it's the devil
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.400]   who has put me on the second floor.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.920]   And you don't understand that God would say,
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.640]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.760]   You've been placed, you think it's random.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.920]   You think that that other person,
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.000]   you were supposed to have a first floor
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.920]   and all of a sudden they moved it away
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.460]   and they ended up putting you next to that
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:19.100]   single widowed mom who lives across from you.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.200]   You think it's random.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.000]   It's not random.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.780]   And could it be you're in the job where you are,
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.220]   today where you went to work,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.680]   the people that you live next to,
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.260]   even the family members you have,
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.500]   all of it, God has placed you there on purpose.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.940]   Don't fail to connect the dots.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.340]   In Matthew chapter five,
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.980]   Jesus says one of the most profound,
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.720]   well-known statements from Jesus that we have.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.500]   And he speaks to this audience of his followers
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.300]   and he says, "As my people,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.120]   "you are the light of the world.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.040]   "A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.780]   "No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.140]   "A lamp is placed on a stand where it gives light
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.820]   "to everyone in the house in the same way
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.580]   "let your good deeds shine out for all to see
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.260]   "so that everyone will praise your heavenly father."
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.900]   Dude, I love Jesus, brilliant.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.220]   Here's what he just said.
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.820]   In this day and age, there would be like one light.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.220]   There wasn't electricity, shocker.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.540]   And so at that time, if you wanna have a light on,
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.540]   lights were really valuable, oil was really expensive.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.980]   So typically every home had just one light.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:31.020]   And whenever you would light that,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.140]   you'd put it very strategically inside of the house
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.920]   in the middle or in the most strategic place
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.900]   to get the most light to light up the room.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.640]   'Cause that was the source of any ability
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.140]   to see at nighttime.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.780]   And he uses a comical example where he's saying like,
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.100]   hey, just like when you light something,
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.420]   you put it very intentionally someplace like nobody.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.780]   And then he does something that his audience
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.780]   would have been like chuckling like, Jesus jokes.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.020]   And he says, "No one would light a lamp
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.560]   "and then come over and light it
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.140]   "and then put a basket on top of it."
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.420]   His audience would be like, yeah, that's crazy.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.520]   Of course he wouldn't.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.820]   God doesn't light lamps and put them
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.500]   in random purposeless places and you're God's lamp.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.900]   He doesn't just put it in places
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.780]   where he doesn't want it to shine on purpose.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.740]   He's put you where he has,
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.820]   he's put you in the job you have,
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.940]   he's put you in the place that you live,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.620]   he's put you in everything about your life.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.860]   It's all purposeful and he's placed you where you are
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.340]   so that you would not make a paycheck
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.140]   or make rich people richer, so that you would go
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.060]   and you would spread the message of Jesus.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.380]   He put a light there and you may be thinking,
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.500]   dude, you don't know my workplace is so dark.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.240]   Like I don't have any Christians I work with.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.740]   I mean, it is like, it's such a toxic environment.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.000]   God put a light there, you.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.520]   And the more that you can begin to connect the dots,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.280]   that I'm not here to get a paycheck.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.800]   I'm not here and my job is not just,
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.840]   hey, I'm an accountant.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.920]   It's not my job today.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.080]   My job is to be a Christian who is an accountant
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.160]   and comes and accounts numbers, but I am a light
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.080]   and I use opportunities to share the gospel.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.300]   I try to spread the message and I try to be an example
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.120]   of what Christ calls me to do and how I work
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.160]   and I work hard, I keep my word.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.880]   And I look for opportunities to point others to Jesus.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.680]   That's what he said.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.760]   Make sure you connect the dots, Jesus said to his audience.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.440]   You're put on purpose where you are.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.760]   And in doing so, hopefully if you believe that
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.840]   and you see that, you know that you're gonna help others
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.000]   through the way you live, connect the dots
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.020]   by seeing your good deeds and pointing
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.420]   to your heavenly father.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.420]   Don't miss out on where you are and why God has you there.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.120]   So many of you, tragically, many who are listening cantily,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.600]   I just know it 'cause I see it every week.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.580]   You're gonna give your 20s to chasing stupid, foolish things
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.520]   to chasing, trying to make a million dollars by your 30
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.140]   and you're gonna give your 20s to a goal
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.140]   that is far too small and far too dumb
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.680]   and he's placed you on purpose intentionally where you are
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.240]   and you think you're a financial advisor
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.640]   and you didn't even wanna have that job
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.880]   and God says, I moved all the pieces around
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.200]   to put you in that firm, to put you in that office,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.640]   to put you in that school district for you to be a light.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.560]   Are you taking advantage of living out your purpose?
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.880]   You were placed on purpose.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.960]   And Mordecai, I love it 'cause he sees
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.240]   what Esther couldn't see.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.520]   Esther, don't miss your moment.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.040]   You're here on purpose.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.200]   Don't lose sight for all the palace and privileges
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.380]   and making something of yourself.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.580]   What a foolish thing to give your life to.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.600]   How much more foolish for us who know Jesus,
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.080]   who see the bigger picture to spend your life
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.320]   and you're gonna spend it, you're gonna chase,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.400]   you're gonna have everything the world would say is success.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.440]   You may have a great house someday,
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.920]   you drove here in a Range or an Audi
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.260]   or whatever you drove here in, you're gonna get married,
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.980]   you got all the kids, you got that golden retriever,
[00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.240]   you got the life people would look at
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.480]   and be like, oh, that's so great.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.800]   And if it doesn't involve you living out your purpose
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.920]   of knowing God and helping others to do that,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.400]   you are wasting your life.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.800]   And some of you get this and you're giving your life to that
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.840]   and you're living on mission and you see yourself as,
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.760]   man, I'm going to work every day.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.580]   And do I love it?
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.520]   No, I don't always love what I get to do
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.360]   or I always love my job, but I'm going in there
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   and I'm looking for opportunities to show Jesus
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.900]   the ultimate treasure or to show people
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.780]   the ultimate treasure of my life.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.520]   It's not a paycheck, it's Jesus.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.020]   I was interrupted today by a girl as I was walking by
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.780]   and she just grabbed me and said, hey, my name is Macy.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   And she said, last week you shared a story
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.860]   about a girl at that Taco Cinco,
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.460]   which I have a contract with Taco Cinco,
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.140]   I have to include it in every message, this Esther.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.700]   So this will be number, no.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.580]   And she said, hey, in that message you talked about,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.980]   you went to that restaurant and you talked with Sarah
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.140]   and you're like, you shared the gospel with Sarah.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:44.120]   And I didn't know that, but earlier that day,
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.680]   or I'm sorry, after that, that same day, unrelated,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.900]   I had gone in and I'd shared the same gospel with Sarah.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.780]   And then I came to the porch and I heard you talk about that
[00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.280]   and I just wanted you to know, like you said,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.460]   I believe that was on purpose.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.900]   And Sarah told me, I guess an hour or two
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.780]   after you guys had bumped into her,
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.300]   that I was the second person that had shared,
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.340]   that someone named David had earlier shared
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.260]   the gospel with her and that it was beginning
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.780]   to mess with her, that God would send two people
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.020]   on the same day to share the message of Jesus.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.420]   And then I came to the porch that night
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.500]   and I just want you to know, it was on purpose.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.120]   And that was just an example of somebody
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.540]   who doesn't work on staff at a church,
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.300]   who said, man, I see an opportunity,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.380]   I'm gonna look for an opportunity to share the gospel
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.540]   and share the message of Jesus to someone I bump into.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.820]   Here's what I wanna challenge you to do.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.700]   This is about to make all the introverts uncomfortable.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.020]   I want you to share the gospel with one person this week.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.140]   I think the Apostle Paul would be embarrassed
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.180]   that I'm even saying one.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.180]   He's like, what, one?
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.820]   Are you, like, one, what?
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.740]   I want you to share the gospel with one person.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.180]   I want you to just try to get in the conversation
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.460]   and just say, man, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.980]   Can I share my faith?
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.740]   Can I share just how God's at work in my life?
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.180]   And if you're like, no, I'll never do that,
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.340]   I can't get there, just invite 'em,
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.500]   you invite 'em to the porch next week,
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.740]   we'll share the gospel with 'em.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.260]   But a better exercise for you to experience
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.380]   and live out your purpose, just open your mouth
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.420]   and share with someone around you.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.540]   Get into a spiritual conversation, or at least try to.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.980]   Try to look for that opportunity.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.440]   And in doing so, living out your purpose,
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.140]   because God has placed you on purpose,
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.740]   he shaped you on purpose.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.380]   The final point is that you can live your life
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.900]   and miss your purpose.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.940]   You can live your entire life,
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.980]   and I hope you leave here with a concern,
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.100]   or a greater awareness.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:42.260]   Every one of us is in danger of spending our life
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.380]   and never fulfilling the God-given purpose
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.220]   for which you were created, the reason you're here,
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.460]   the reason you're alive, and spending your,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.340]   some of the most energetic, best years that you have in life
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.060]   and giving them to corporate America,
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.100]   giving them to the pursuit of a relationship
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.380]   that will never satisfy you in terms of a dating relationship
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.220]   or marriage relationship, pursuing anything
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.860]   that is detached from you, knowing God and walking with him
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.900]   and helping others do the same, not perfectly,
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.740]   but with other people in your life.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.060]   And you're gonna spend some of the best years,
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.880]   and you're here tonight,
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.720]   and you probably won't even come back,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.780]   but I hope you just hear me, you are wasting your life.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.700]   You're wasting it.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.620]   You don't have to, God doesn't want you to.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.260]   And just like there was an enemy in this story
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.960]   who wanted to destroy the people of God,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.420]   there's an enemy in your life and in our world named Satan.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.980]   And he wants you to spend your years, your 20s, your 30s,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.420]   your life, listen to me very closely,
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.700]   he doesn't want you to have an impact.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.580]   He wants you to live for insignificant things,
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.500]   like how much is in your bank account.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.420]   He wants you to live for the type of car that you drive,
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   what other people think about you,
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.940]   how many followers you have on Instagram.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.740]   That's the type of foolish, pointless, worthless stuff.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.860]   He's gonna say, "You should pursue that."
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.000]   That's really what matters.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.980]   Let's not get all crazy religious here
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.940]   and be really pushy about Jesus.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.700]   Let's just kind of, I like to keep work at work
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.500]   and church at church and just kind of
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.660]   right down the fairway.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.780]   Because he doesn't want you to have an impact.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:04.380]   And Mordecai looks at her and he says something
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.280]   so brilliant.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.900]   And it points to the fact that Mordecai knew
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.100]   the promises of God.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.820]   Remember what he said?
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.140]   He said, and he got a message from her, he goes,
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.920]   "Oh, you're afraid he's gonna kill you.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.400]   "You know you're gonna die anyways.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.520]   "And God is going to deliver his people."
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.600]   Because Mordecai had read the book, he knew the prophecies.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.900]   He's gonna send a Messiah, which means the Jewish people
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:30.800]   won't be annihilated.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.480]   Whatever Haman thinks and wants,
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480]   I don't know how it's gonna go,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.940]   but I know the rest of the movie here
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.600]   and it's not gonna go like that.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.640]   'Cause Jesus hasn't come yet.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.560]   So he's gonna raise up a deliverer from somewhere else.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.360]   So I don't know if it's gonna be you,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.960]   but if it's not you, you can rest assured
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.740]   somebody else is gonna step in the gap
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.480]   and you're gonna miss out on your purpose.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.080]   And could it be he's placed you in this moment,
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.600]   and I just want you to think about it.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.960]   I just want you to honestly think about,
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   could it be all the different things in your life
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.620]   that may feel random, seem random, the places you live,
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.420]   the people you sit in a cube next to,
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.640]   could it be that God has put you there for a purpose
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.600]   and he's placed you on purpose
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.520]   and he's invited you to not miss out on your purpose
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.560]   by sharing the message of Jesus with those people.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.380]   And it's not dependent on you.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.220]   If he wants the person in the cube next to you saved,
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.060]   he's gonna save them.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.700]   Just like if he wants to save the people of Israel,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.300]   it's not dependent on you, but you can be a part of it.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.960]   And he's invited you to be a part of it.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.460]   What are you gonna do, Esther?
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.420]   And I think the same thing is said to us.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.020]   How do you wanna spend your life
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:38.860]   chasing what every story in Hollywood clearly reflects,
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.820]   never satisfies?
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.980]   Or actually walking with the God who does
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.820]   and helping others in our world to do the same.
[00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.480]   There's never been a time that I know of in my lifetime
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.420]   where it's been more needed for the body of Christ
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.200]   to step up and be part of living out their faith
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.700]   and not a dead Christianity that checks the box
[00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.060]   and I go to heaven when I die
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.900]   and I'm not living for anything purposeless.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.200]   Or I am living for a life that's purposeless now.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.320]   There was a chance I've had recently
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.260]   to coach my kids' soccer games, my son,
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.280]   and he's four, so it's really intense.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.900]   And so we've got this team together and it's four on four.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.860]   So we've got these four kids
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.100]   and we're part of the Red Knights.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.020]   We had our first game two weeks ago.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.120]   I don't wanna brag, but we went five and O.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.960]   And it's these four kids, or four at a time.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.000]   You know, it's a team of like seven,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.220]   but only four at a time can play
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.860]   and two of them had to miss.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.820]   We had like five kids and we're playing the game
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.860]   and there's one kid on our team, it was like not fair.
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.680]   It made me like question genetics, wow,
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.360]   really play a factor because this kid,
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.900]   his name was Jacob and he was out there
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.420]   and he was on our team and he's the reason we won five O.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.620]   He went hat trick style.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.140]   I mean, it was impressive, it was incredible.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.420]   And here's what made him different.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.360]   He wasn't bigger than anybody else.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.660]   He was actually a little smaller.
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.620]   He just got the game.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:06.300]   He literally like understood, okay, I take this ball
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.500]   and I go to that goal, right?
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.960]   That's what I do and I don't use my hands, use my feet.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.940]   Got it, I'll do it.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.940]   And he would go and he'd run and he'd get the ball
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.980]   and he would just run down the field.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.980]   And every other kid is still kind of like,
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   which goal and dandelion.
[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.700]   And Jacob is over there just like,
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.820]   he's threading the needle and he just got it.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.060]   Like he can simply like, oh, I get the point of the game
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.460]   and I can do it.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.020]   And then we had one kid on our team,
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.260]   what's it called, little Johnny,
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.060]   who the entire time, like we tried to get to play
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.020]   and he didn't want to, he like sat on the bench
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.140]   and he just wanted to eat goldfish.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.800]   And we're like, hey, we'll hold your hand.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.520]   We gotta get Jacob off the field.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.160]   He's destroying the other team.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.840]   Please, please give us something to tag in.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.120]   And he was like, no, I don't want to play.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.440]   And he sat and asked goldfish, we're like, hey,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.040]   your dad can come with you on the field.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.460]   And he just continued to not want to play.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:58.960]   And we just sat over there and he was really sad.
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.440]   Like his grandparents had come, he was like,
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.640]   hey, this is your time, come on.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.440]   And he's like got the cleats just hanging from the bench.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.440]   And in that moment, it was like, dude, what a contrast.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.580]   We have one who like clearly gets like,
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.420]   this is the point of the game.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.540]   I know what winning looks like.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.760]   And then we have one who is like,
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.900]   I don't want to play at all.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.460]   I'd rather just sit over here on the bench
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.400]   and be comfortable.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.220]   What a perfect picture of the Christian life
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.340]   for so many people.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.380]   Like, I think the decision for all of us,
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.580]   for me every single day, it wakes up
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.660]   and am I going to be Jacob?
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.460]   Like I get the point of life, the game of life
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.880]   is not to score goals in soccer,
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.800]   it's to know God and help others do the same.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.040]   Anything else I give my life to that doesn't involve
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.480]   a focus of how I can further do that is foolishness.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.480]   And I know how to win the game
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.800]   and I know how to play the game.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.760]   'Cause that's the point ultimately of the game
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.960]   or called life.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.280]   And then the other one of just someone
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:56.440]   who sits on the sideline and is like,
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.560]   I don't really want to do that.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.920]   I just want to sit here and eat goldfish.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.800]   And so many of you, it breaks my heart.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.320]   You're going to spend your 20s eating goldfish.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.180]   And those goldfish look like you pursuing
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.460]   tender relationships and getting drunk on the weekends
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.740]   because you're trying to cope with the fact
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.700]   that you don't actually like your life.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.660]   And you spending your 20s not plugged in
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.380]   and serving the city and using your time and energy
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.120]   to help other people, but serving your time,
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.300]   working a 90 hour job because that's just what
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   somebody told you you have to do in order to make it.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.940]   And by make it, they mean make a lot of money.
[00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.220]   And you are wasting your life
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.140]   and you're going to sit on the bench.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.680]   If anything in your life, or you are sitting on the bench,
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.400]   if things in your life are not connected to
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.640]   and pointed to your purpose of knowing God
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.560]   and helping others know him.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.920]   And Mordecai in a way that I love,
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:45.840]   says, don't you see it, Esther?
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.960]   None of it's on coincidence or none of it's random.
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:54.040]   And he has you here and he has you here.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.240]   And it's all on purpose.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.340]   The question is, are you going to connect the dots and see it?
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.840]   In conclusion, you've been shaped on purpose.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   You've been placed on purpose.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.360]   And it is possible for you to miss your purpose.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.720]   And let me close right here.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.860]   Esther ends up and we're going to look at her story.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:15.280]   She ends up stepping out and despite what it costs her,
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.280]   she goes and she's a part of delivering the nation.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.060]   We'll look at more of the story in the weeks ahead.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.460]   What happens next is that God uses her
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.940]   in this incredible miraculous,
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.260]   like, wow, God showed up kind of way.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.620]   The nation is delivered.
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:33.280]   And that day of destruction that Haman had rolled the light,
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.620]   the dice, the Purim, to be a part of selecting,
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.080]   this is the day that will be destruction,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.940]   became the exact day that God brought deliverance.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.640]   And to this day, since the story of Esther,
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.420]   the Jewish community today, they still do it,
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.600]   have celebrated a festival called Purim.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.860]   Do you know this?
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.740]   It's a festival called Purim.
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.880]   It's like one of the, I think,
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.740]   funnest Jewish festivals that there are.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.340]   I don't know how really fun ones there are,
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.220]   but it's a one that is a mixture
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.460]   of like Halloween meets Christmas.
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.540]   You wear costumes, kids get candy,
[00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.500]   you end up getting food,
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.540]   and you give gifts to one another.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.800]   It's like really exciting.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.640]   So there's some people,
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.180]   there's festivals all over the place,
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.620]   of people to this day celebrating Purim.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.060]   And it's a reminder, and remember that, hey,
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.060]   the day of destruction has become a day of deliverance
[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.220]   for us, that our God showed up and he delivered.
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.520]   And to this day, it's celebrated.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.340]   It's also a day that Jesus,
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.500]   when he was on the planet, celebrated.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.580]   'Cause it started 500 years before Jesus
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.100]   and has continued for 2,500 years,
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.580]   and we're told in John chapter five, verse one,
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.500]   that Jesus showed up and he attended this festival,
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.940]   this feast in the midst of the city.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.540]   And it's a feast that's not told the name,
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.500]   but it's a month before Passover, which is Purim.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.240]   And inside of that festival, he goes around,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.820]   and there's a man he sees that's lame.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.380]   It's John chapter five.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.460]   And he's been laying there,
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.820]   and it says he's been unable to walk for 38 years.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.900]   And Jesus goes up and he says,
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.860]   "Hey, do you wanna get well?"
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.180]   And the guy says, "Yes."
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.980]   And he says, "Get up and walk, take your mat and go."
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.860]   We're told that the festival was also on a Sabbath.
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.780]   So all of a sudden, these religious people come,
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.220]   and they're like, "Hey, God had a rule.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   "You can't heal people on Sabbath or do work."
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.660]   And Jesus responds, "God is always working,
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.080]   "and so am I always working."
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.100]   And then he says something else
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.620]   in the midst of this festival, Purim,
[00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:24.620]   celebration of destruction becoming deliverance.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.620]   I tell you the truth.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:29.780]   Those who listen to my message,
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.020]   and they believe in God,
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.580]   who sent me to have eternal life,
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.060]   they have eternal life.
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.740]   They will never be condemned for their sins.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:45.300]   They have already passed from death to life.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.620]   And I assure you a time is coming.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.020]   Indeed, it's here now.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.140]   When the dead will hear my voice,
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.820]   the voice of the Son of God, and they will live.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.620]   He says, "It's a festival."
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.180]   There's an even greater deliverance that has come
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.300]   for those who are heading to destruction,
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.940]   and that deliverance comes from me, Jesus.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:14.380]   And then he says something that's so beautifully profound
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:18.060]   and appropriate and relevant to Esther, and he says this,
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.180]   "To this group of Pharisees who didn't understand
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.620]   "they were talking to me,
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.860]   "who didn't understand they were talking to God,
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.780]   "and they would miss God because they put religion
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.380]   "in place of relationship,
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.100]   "you search the Scriptures
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.220]   "because you think they give you eternal life.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.260]   "The Scriptures point to me,
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.980]   "yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life."
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.020]   Jesus tells this group, "All of the stories,
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.060]   "everything, every verse, every story, every moment,
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.700]   "all of the things that you read in the Scriptures,
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.260]   "they all were to point to me."
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.020]   Esther, Genesis, everything points to him.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.620]   And the even greater deliverance that came,
[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.020]   because just as great as the deliverance
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.060]   that this day of destruction, Purim,
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.580]   that's the name of the celebration.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.820]   Every Purim festival, we celebrate
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.540]   that the day was to be destroyed, we were delivered.
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:12.120]   On a cross, Jesus would sow an even greater day
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.580]   that looked like the world would be destroyed,
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.820]   that destruction was headed,
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.580]   there would be an even greater deliverance,
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.580]   and all of Esther ultimately points to Jesus.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.780]   And this life is not random,
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.180]   and all of it was woven together,
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.380]   and Jesus says it's about him.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.980]   The story, your life, all of life, finding him.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.720]   And do you know what's crazy?
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.460]   In case you're going, "Man, what a coincidence."
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.500]   Do you know what today is?
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.080]   Today is March 10th, 2020.
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.220]   I know, shocker.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.060]   It's Purim.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.660]   Today, millions of Jewish people around the world
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.140]   are celebrating Purim.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.860]   And the festival that, hey, there's a God out there
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.060]   who, despite the fact that we deserve destruction
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.980]   or headed towards destruction,
[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.780]   has provided deliverance for his people.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.700]   And they have missed the fact,
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.100]   and Jesus says you have missed
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.860]   that the greater deliverance has come through me
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.540]   and your life, and it's not random.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.700]   And if you don't know Jesus,
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.500]   tonight is the night where the God who's there
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.060]   has brought you to this place, and it's not random.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.260]   And he brought you in here,
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.940]   and you think it's just 'cause a friend invited you
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.300]   and they told you it would be,
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.900]   you thought it was a restaurant you were headed to,
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.720]   and you ended up in a church,
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.540]   and it's because God has been pursuing you,
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.820]   and it is not random, and he's extended that.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.820]   And anyone who believes in him will never be condemned.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.540]   They will be delivered from destruction.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.460]   And they have already passed from death to life.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.220]   And in a moment, if you trust in Jesus
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.660]   as the payment for your sin,
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.260]   that is what Christianity is about.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.940]   God saved the queen, God saved you,
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.060]   he saves everybody the same way,
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.860]   through putting faith in Christ,
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.420]   his death on the cross, that he came and he died
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:49.400]   as a payment for your sin, and he was buried
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.840]   and he rose again to give you eternal life,
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.840]   an abundant life now, and it is not random,
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.320]   and whether you believe me or not,
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.400]   someday you will, and you'll see it.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.320]   And all of it was God weaving and bringing it together
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.600]   so that you would know he hasn't forgotten you,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.420]   he loves you, he cares about you.
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.640]   And to the rest of us, he's saying,
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.880]   I want you to experience your purpose.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.200]   You gotta believe it.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:15.600]   You were placed and shaped, and it's on purpose.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.800]   And you don't have to like your job
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.860]   or even like your apartment,
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.880]   but you gotta know you're there on purpose,
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.520]   or you're not gonna live out your purpose.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.360]   Let me pray.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:28.600]   Father, I pray for the millions of Jewish men and women
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.640]   who are of the same bloodline of the God
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.600]   that we sing songs to, the God that we worship,
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.480]   the God, our savior, Jesus.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:43.520]   I pray that they would hear, as you say in John 5, verse 25,
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.360]   the voice of the son of God, and they will listen and live
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.960]   and be delivered from an even greater destruction
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:55.760]   that life is, apart from being connected to you.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.460]   I pray now for anyone here
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.880]   who has never received that free gift,
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.480]   this would be their moment.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:04.840]   Would you help us who have to live lives of purpose
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.280]   and connect the dots to what you're doing
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.480]   and where you have us.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.560]   We worship you in song, amen.
