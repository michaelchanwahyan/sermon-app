1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Good evening and welcome to the porch.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,960
 relationships.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,600
 Can we cue some music please? From our friendships to our romantic endeavors

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,240
 we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships,

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,280
 work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,120
 So how do we relate? To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,600
 what God has to say about our relationships.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,400
 This is, after all, the Relationship Series.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,960
 Porch, how we doing? We doing okay tonight?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
 Great to see you. Welcome to the Relationship Series. If you're here for

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,160
 the very first time over the course of the last several weeks we have been navigating

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,520
 God's design for connecting to one another. And I'm really excited for where

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,840
 we're headed this evening, but before we go there

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,640
 I do want to say hey to some special friends that are tuning in online. All of

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,360
 Porch Live, so grateful y'all are a part

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,840
 of what God is doing here in Dallas and I'm grateful that he's doing something

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,920
 exactly where

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,000
 you are. Special shout out to Porch Live Fresno,

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,720
 Porch Live Fort Worth, and Porch Live Midland, Texas.

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,480
 Midland down front, I love it.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,200
 In the Count of Monte Cristo

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,240
 Edmond Dantes said, "I,

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,960
 who have also been betrayed, assassinated,

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,520
 and cast into a tomb, have emerged from that tomb by the grace of God

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,640
 and I owe it to God to take my revenge.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,160
 He has sent me for that purpose. Here I am."

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,120
 Don Vito Corleone said in The Godfather,

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,960
 "Revenge is a dish that tastes best when served cold."

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,920
 Maximus in the movie Gladiator said, "My name is Maximus

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,960
 Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the North,

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,360
 general of the Felix legions, loyal servant to the true

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,080
 emperor Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son,

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,960
 husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,320
 in this life or the next." Inigo Montoya

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,440
 in The Princess Bride said, "Hello,

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,280
 my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,920
 Prepare to die."

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,120
 And then Taylor Swift said this,

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
 "But I got smarter.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,080
 I got harder in the nick of time. Honey, I rose up from the dead.

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,240
 I do it all the time. I got a list of names

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
 and yours is in red underlined. I check it once,

44
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,480
 I check it twice. Oh, ooh,

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,360
 look what you made me do. Look what you..."

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,440
 We'll stop there.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,960
 Oh, the feeling of revenge, something our world can relate to

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,680
 so well since every single one of us,

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,560
 regardless of where we are, what our station is in life,

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,800
 we'll find ourselves betrayed to one degree or the next.

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,880
 Why do I tell you that? Because this idea of betrayal,

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,360
 whether it's a betrayal of values or personality or privacy

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,160
 or your background or religious affiliation,

54
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,640
 whatever it may be,

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,320
 all of us are subject to being betrayed at one point or another.

56
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,920
 And that betrayal is frequently the underlying force behind most estranged

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,680
 relationships today. It's interesting.

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,800
 If you go and you look at the market research,

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 what you'll find is that the largest national survey on estranged

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 relationships recently found that 25% of Americans

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,360
 will experience an estranged relationship at some point in their life.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,120
 That means one out of every four people will experience estrangement,

63
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,440
 meaning that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle aren't the only ones that feel a

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
 rift in the family.

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,280
 You and I are subject to experiencing this at some point ourselves.

66
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,400
 To carry on the idea,

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,280
 just one look at the bestsellers list for parenting and relationships on Amazon

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,440
 will prove this is also true because books like Set Boundaries,

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,240
 Find Peace, Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,320
 It's not you identifying and healing from narcissistic people.

71
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,040
 I'm glad my mom died, which is apparently a comedy,

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
 but it sounds like there's some pain there.

73
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,080
 And Trauma Bonding all made the top 25.

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,840
 In a different study done by Cornell,

75
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,840
 researchers found that 10% of all people surveyed within our nation are

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,320
 presently in an estranged relationship.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,400
 That right now out of the total American population,

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,760
 10% of people are experiencing estrangement.

79
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,280
 That means that 33 million people right now are experiencing this.

80
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,040
 Why do I tell you all of this information?

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:07,120
 Because there's a strong probability that each of us will face estrangement at

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,760
 some point in our life.

83
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,600
 And there's a really strong possibility that some of you are facing

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,960
 estrangement right here tonight.

85
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,320
 And the reason I unpack all of that for you is because we need to understand

86
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,680
 what does it look like for us to move through what is likely,

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
 not just a possibility, but an inevitability for all of us,

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,640
 that we're not just going to experience it personally,

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,280
 but we're likely going to meet someone, know someone,

90
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,400
 be related to someone that is experiencing this themselves.

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,640
 How do we move our way through it?

92
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,640
 As we consider lost love and broken relationships and damaged unions on the

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,000
 basis of things like abuse, whether it's sexual or emotional or,

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,200
 or physical or divorce or abandonment by a parent or a violation of one's own

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,680
 privacy, or your boundaries are not respected by someone,

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,560
 there's control and manipulation perpetuated in your life by someone else.

97
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,240
 What does it look like for us to walk through these types of difficulties and

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,120
 find ourselves better on the other side?

99
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
 You see estrangement.

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
 It's not something that we should ask the question of whether or not it will

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,880
 find us. The question is, what do we do when it finds us?

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,080
 Which is exactly what I want to talk to you about tonight.

103
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,400
 In order for us to do it, we're going to be in the book of Genesis.

104
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,280
 So if you have a Bible,

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,720
 you can go ahead and grab it and you can turn with me a good place for you to

106
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,880
 land is probably chapter 42, but I'll just level with you from the get go here.

107
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,520
 We're going to be all over the grid because the guy we're looking at tonight,

108
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 one who is extremely familiar with betrayal is a guy by the name of Joseph.

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,920
 And what you need to know is that his story,

110
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,680
 it unpacks from chapter 37 all the way to chapter 50.

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,880
 And so we're going to work through all of that literature together tonight.

112
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,360
 And so we're not going to be in just one passage.

113
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,560
 We're going to be moving across a lot of scripture.

114
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
 And so here's my encouragement to you.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
 Follow what's on the screens and then go read it later on.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
 Like read all 13 chapters,

117
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,240
 catch up on what's happening in the life of Joseph.

118
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
 But why we're looking at him is because I want us to consider how do we walk the

119
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,640
 road back from betrayal?

120
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,800
 And he's the perfect person to look at to help us understand it because this

121
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,480
 brother's story is riddled with betrayal.

122
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,160
 Like you meet him when he's 17 years old and you find that more cycles of

123
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 betrayal and abuse move through his life in just a matter of 13 years,

124
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,640
 then likely many of us will experience in a lifetime.

125
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,200
 Just to give you some context so that way you understand Joseph was abused by

126
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,160
 his family, trafficked by strangers, used by people he worked for,

127
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,320
 sexually assaulted by his boss's wife, falsely accused,

128
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,280
 thrown in prison and forgotten by the people that he thought were his friends.

129
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,760
 For 13 years he moves from one abusive situation to another.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,880
 He's betrayed by people he trusts and he is victimized again and again and again.

131
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,640
 Never do you see him as being solely in the wrong.

132
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,520
 He never takes the offending seat.

133
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,320
 He is always sitting in the offended seat.

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,720
 And yet though this happens to him over and over and over again,

135
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 what you find as you study Joseph's story is that he's not alone because over

136
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,720
 and over and over again, God was with him.

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,760
 Which brings us to our first point as we consider what it looks like to walk the

138
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,680
 road back from betrayal in our lives.

139
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,120
 We need to know that God never abandons the abandoned.

140
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,800
 God never abandons the abandoned.

141
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,520
 Like after Joseph was beaten and stripped and sold into slavery by his brothers,

142
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,800
 we learned that God didn't abandon him. It says in Genesis 39 verses two through

143
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,000
 three,

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,640
 you'll find them on the screens that the Lord was with Joseph and he became a

145
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
 successful man and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.

146
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,320
 His master saw the Lord was with him and that the Lord caused all that he did to

147
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,280
 succeed in his hands.

148
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,320
 So much so that he rose to power within his master's house.

149
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,440
 His master's name was Potiphar and Joseph,

150
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,120
 because the Lord's favor was upon his life, rises to a position of power.

151
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
 So much so that he's running the entire estate.

152
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,600
 Things are going extremely well until Potiphar's wife tries to seduce him.

153
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,360
 And because he rejects her as her advances and she's scorned in rejection,

154
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,720
 she ends up deciding to lie about him,

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,440
 mar his character, have him fired from his job,

156
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,000
 and then ultimately thrown in prison. And yet though all of it happened,

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,920
 guess what? God did not abandon him.

158
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,600
 We see in Genesis 39, 21,

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
 but the Lord was with Joseph and he showed him steadfast love and he gave him

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,800
 favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. So much favor, in fact,

161
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,160
 that Joseph, he's not just a prisoner.

162
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,960
 He is the leader of the entire cell block.

163
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,440
 Like he's running the prison and he,

164
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,400
 what he finds is he's doing so as he meets a couple of different guys,

165
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,120
 some cellmates of his that are having some dreams.

166
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,240
 They're losing sleep to a couple of different dreams.

167
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,080
 They can't seem to interpret. And that's kind of Joseph's specialty.

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,160
 You know anything about a story? He's the interpreter of dreams.

169
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,000
 And so they unpack for him what they're dreaming about in the evening.

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,120
 And Joseph tells him exactly what's up.

171
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
 And what we learned is that one of them gets out of prison and ultimately

172
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,200
 re-ascends back to the court of Pharaoh himself. And Joseph tells him, Hey,

173
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
 that's going to happen. And once you go, don't forget about me.

174
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,800
 Like I'm locked up down here, but I'm not supposed to be down here.

175
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,880
 So when you get back to Pharaoh's side,

176
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,320
 remember my name and bring me out from where I am.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,480
 But as goes Joseph's luck,

178
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,920
 he's totally forgotten about he's left in prison.

179
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,320
 The guy does not keep his word whatsoever.

180
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,080
 That is until Pharaoh begins to have some dreams of his own,

181
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,760
 some things that he cannot interpret.

182
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,840
 And so he decides to ask around and see if anybody knows of someone that can

183
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
 prophesy of dreams.

184
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,560
 And it just so happens that Joseph's old cellmate remembers,

185
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,720
 I do know a guy there's this guy named Joe.

186
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,800
 He's down in cell block A pull him out. He can help you interpret his dream.

187
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,400
 And so Joseph gets brought out to Pharaoh and he begins to interpret to Pharaoh

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,080
 all that he's been dreaming. And he not only tells him, Hey,

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,840
 this is the problem becoming, he tells him of a solution to that problem.

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,960
 Pharaoh's so impressed. He hires him on the spot, brings him onto his team.

191
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,520
 And what you realize is that God did not abandon him. Genesis 41,

192
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,080
 37 through 41 says this proposal, the one that Joseph made,

193
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
 it pleased Pharaoh and all his servants. And Pharaoh said to his servants,

194
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,080
 can we find a man like this? And whom is the spirit of God?

195
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,840
 He's kind of one of a kind. And then Pharaoh said to Joseph,

196
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,240
 since God has shown you all this,

197
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,280
 there is none so discerning and wise as you are.

198
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,680
 You shall be over my house and all my people shall order themselves as you

199
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,400
 command. Only as regards the throne, will I be greater than you.

200
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,680
 That's a position of power.

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,200
 He's second in command of the ruling empire of the day, Egypt.

202
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,280
 And that's exactly what Pharaoh says.

203
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,160
 See I have set you over all the land of Egypt. You see over and over again,

204
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,560
 though Joseph was repeatedly abandoned by those he trusted,

205
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,560
 he was never abandoned by a God who was actually trustworthy.

206
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,640
 He's never abandoned by God who's actually a treasure. And because he knew it,

207
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
 Joseph never takes matters into his own hands.

208
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,560
 Like he never rages against the heavens or raise the fist to God.

209
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,600
 He never tries to finesse and angle his way out of the difficulties he's facing.

210
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,120
 Instead, he just decides to trust the Lord where he is.

211
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,840
 Despite the fact that all the betrayal he's experienced has,

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,840
 has leveled him to a position he never should have been in.

213
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,400
 He trusts the Lord who raises him consistently.

214
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,760
 And what's crazy about it is no one would have blamed him if he would have

215
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,480
 raised a fist to heaven. Like no one would have looked at him and be like, dude,

216
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,800
 you're crazy. Like, why are you doing that?

217
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,600
 Because the odds are that we would have done that ourself.

218
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,560
 That we in the face of such injustice would have looked at God and been like,

219
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,560
 what are you doing? Why is this happening? It makes no sense, God.

220
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,760
 And yet Joseph doesn't do it.

221
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,080
 And it's interesting,

222
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,640
 like as I was trying to pull together some examples to just help us understand

223
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,400
 how popularized revenge is in our culture,

224
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,160
 I decided to kind of leave them on the table because I don't need to pull a bunch

225
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,560
 of mainstream references to help us understand that revenge is popular.

226
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,280
 I just need to point to you because the truth of the matter is we think revenge

227
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
 is a pretty popular idea.

228
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,800
 Like we need to only look to ourself to realize that this is often the response

229
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,120
 we choose ourselves that we don't reflect what Joseph does.

230
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,240
 We instead reflect what the world does. Like just think about it.

231
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,800
 What happens when you get cut off in traffic?

232
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,640
 You laugh because you do know what happens when you get cut off in traffic. Oh,

233
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,600
 no, you didn't. You like,

234
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,560
 you get the gas and you swear out and you cut them off and you make sure that you

235
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,800
 get right back in your respective position.

236
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,720
 You establish street side superiority. How dare they?

237
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,960
 Like what happens when someone writes a negative comment on one of your posts?

238
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,760
 You know what? I'm going to get on their profile. I'm going to incriminate them.

239
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,360
 I'm going to figure out what it is about them that gives them absolutely no

240
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,240
 validity with any respect to an opinion that they have to say about me.

241
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,200
 And then you know what I'm going to do?

242
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
 I'm going to respond to something that's so much smarter than what they said that

243
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,800
 they're going to look dumb in front of everybody that's read their post.

244
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,240
 What about when you run into the people that used to mock you in high school?

245
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,360
 Oh baby, when that 10 year reunion shows up, I'm going to look good.

246
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,760
 I'm going to be successful. I'm going to be fit. I'm going to be ready.

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,520
 They're going to know I'm going to make sure everyone's put on notice that I

248
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,480
 have actually surpassed them all. This is our natural response.

249
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,480
 Like we don't want to turn the other cheek. We don't want to pull punches.

250
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,000
 We don't want to bite our tongue. We want justice. We want vindication.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,480
 We want revenge.

252
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,160
 So what are you wanting revenge for tonight?

253
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,200
 And let me ask, like, what do you think it's going to cost you to get it?

254
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,240
 If the research is true,

255
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,880
 it's going to cost you so much more than it's going to cost the person you're

256
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,080
 actually trying to get revenge from.

257
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:41,360
 Martin Luther King jr. said this in spite of the fact that the law of revenge

258
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
 solves no social problems,

259
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,480
 men continue to follow its disastrous leading history.

260
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,000
 It's cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,480
 self-defeating path.

262
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,920
 So if we're not supposed to pursue revenge,

263
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,840
 how then are we supposed to respond differently to the injustices in our life?

264
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,080
 Well, we need to remember what Joseph does. What does Joseph do?

265
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,880
 What does Joseph know?

266
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,240
 He knows the sovereignty of God rules over the atrocities of men.

267
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 That the sovereignty of God rules over every atrocity in mankind.

268
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,760
 So just a few years ago, some really dear friends of mine and Brooke,

269
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,440
 they were dealt with some really tragic news.

270
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,120
 They learned that they had had a miscarriage and the reason it was especially

271
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,560
 difficult for them in that moment,

272
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,960
 though every miscarriage is tragic was because this was their first pregnancy.

273
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,080
 And so they learned that they had had a miscarriage and in a moment where no one

274
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,000
 would have blamed them for being frustrated with God,

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
 like no one would have looked at them and be like, man,

276
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
 it doesn't make sense that you're not angry with the Lord,

277
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,880
 that you don't feel like he's abandoned you,

278
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,440
 that you're actually raising a fist and raging against the heavens.

279
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,120
 They chose not to do any of it. Instead, they remained faithful,

280
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,680
 consistent in their belief. Why?

281
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,320
 Because they trusted God's character. They trusted God's sovereignty.

282
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,000
 They knew there's nothing in heaven or on earth that does not

283
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,040
 pass, which God does not allow. And what we know is he's good.

284
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,960
 Our God is so good. And so therefore we're not going to give up on him.

285
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,320
 We're not going to question him.

286
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,320
 We're not going to lose trust because we believe he's the one that's in control.

287
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,920
 He's the one that works for good.

288
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,520
 He's the one that takes something so broken as this and somehow he makes it into

289
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,280
 beauty. And because this was their perspective,

290
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
 they named their little girl Eden,

291
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,200
 which means delight in the reason they named her Eden is because as they would

292
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,000
 tell her story to those watching around,

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,320
 they wanted people to know, Hey, God is the giver of life,

294
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,480
 not just in the here and now, but he's the giver of life forever and always.

295
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 That's what a perspective that properly understands God's sovereignty looks

296
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,840
 like. A perspective like that,

297
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,840
 like it can stare down the barrel of the world's worst and it can still stake

298
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,760
 claim on the fact that God is good, that he can be counted on.

299
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,200
 That he's not forgotten, that he's not run out on you,

300
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,400
 that he hasn't abandoned you. Deuteronomy 31,

301
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,880
 8 says it is the Lord who goes before you.

302
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,040
 He will be with you. He won't leave you or forsake you.

303
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,080
 Do not fear or be dismayed.

304
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,680
 Hebrews 13, 6 says so we can confidently say the Lord is my helper.

305
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:54,120
 I will not fear. What can man do to me? This kind of perspective,

306
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,640
 it's so important as we consider what it looks like to walk back down the road

307
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,880
 from betrayal. Because without this kind of perspective,

308
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,040
 everything else we talk about moving forward from this point here tonight is

309
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400
 fruitless. Like if you don't have this focus,

310
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,680
 then everything else is useless. You might as well pack up and go home.

311
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,800
 Because Joseph, everything in his life,

312
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,120
 it was undergirded by the reality that he trusted God. He knew the Lord is

313
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,160
 sovereign. So whatever comes, hell, high water, I'm going to be okay.

314
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,000
 I trust the Lord is with me. He knew.

315
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,240
 God doesn't just react to what happens in people's lives.

316
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,240
 He rules over people's lives, that there are no exceptions to God's sovereignty.

317
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,280
 Not even you, not even your story.

318
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,880
 Like God, he doesn't waste our pain. But here's the thing, Borge,

319
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,680
 we can waste our pain if we're not careful.

320
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,400
 Like as we look at the story of Joseph, what we see is that,

321
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,320
 is that though he trusted the Lord and God provided for him time and again,

322
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,120
 he still,

323
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,200
 he still had some piece of his heart living in the shadow of his estrangement.

324
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,440
 That though he was able to move forward in life,

325
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,440
 what you see is he doesn't actually walk back from betrayal.

326
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,200
 He walks down the road into bitterness.

327
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,440
 And the way we know it is because if we keep reading in his story, we see, man,

328
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,080
 he's gotten everything he's wanted. Like no one would,

329
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,040
 no one would think otherwise from trading into a life like Joseph had when he

330
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,000
 found himself in Egypt because he ascended to the right hand of Pharaoh.

331
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,160
 Like he got a new name and he got a new house and he got a new wife and he got a

332
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,720
 new family. Like everything looked amazing.

333
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,040
 And yet as he stands at the precipice of all this new,

334
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,880
 he looks into his family and he decides to name his sons a couple of different

335
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
 things. It says in Genesis 41, 51 and 52,

336
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,520
 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh.

337
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,640
 For he said, God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house.

338
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,520
 The name of the second he called Ephraim.

339
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,240
 For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.

340
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,960
 How do we know that Joseph didn't waste his pain?

341
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,800
 Because if we look at the names of these two boys,

342
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,640
 what we realize is he basically names his kids,

343
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,240
 screw you and look at me now.

344
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,560
 That's essentially what he does. Like he looks,

345
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,440
 he looks at his former life and he says, no, no, no. In my now life,

346
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,000
 the life that I have here today,

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 I'm going to establish and identify the fact that I'm not who I once was,

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,440
 that what you did to me isn't being done to me any longer.

349
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,840
 Like he decides in response to the powerlessness that he felt as a child to

350
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,240
 declare his power through his own children.

351
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,440
 And it's because his betrayal grew into bitterness. Why?

352
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,840
 Because the longer you dwell on an offense,

353
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,240
 the more data you begin to collect about that offense.

354
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,160
 And the more data you collect about an offense,

355
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,440
 brews more disdain for the offender. And we know this,

356
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,640
 like this is why when someone pokes a little fun at you or they take a quick

357
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,880
 jab or they make a passing comment, when you should just dismiss it,

358
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,880
 you dwell on it. And as you dwell on that one thing, they said,

359
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,200
 you start to think about everything that they said.

360
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
 And if you think about everything they said,

361
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,120
 you start to think about all the ways they said it.

362
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,760
 And if you start to think about all the ways they said,

363
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
 you start to think about what they probably meant by it.

364
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,640
 And where it was just a passing comment about something weird you wore once is

365
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,000
 now like a meticulously curated assault on your identity because you have

366
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,040
 embittered yourself against them.

367
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,000
 You have imprisoned yourself to their thoughts about you.

368
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,480
 You have allowed what they said to take greater root in your life than it was

369
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
 ever meant to.

370
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,160
 You've allowed it to take greater real estate in your heart than it was ever

371
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,200
 meant to. That's why victim mentality is just self-sabotage.

372
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,360
 Like it's imprisoning yourself to the past until you're so burnt up with

373
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,000
 bitterness that the greatest betrayer in your story isn't anyone else.

374
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
 It's you.

375
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,880
 And yet the author of Hebrews tells us of a different way.

376
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,040
 He says in chapter 12,

377
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:16,280
 make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be Holy.

378
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,480
 Without holiness, no one will see the Lord.

379
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,440
 See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root

380
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,120
 grows up to cause trouble and defile many.

381
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,640
 What's he saying? Bitterness is like a weed.

382
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
 So when I became a homeowner,

383
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,800
 the man in me was instantaneously in love with his front yard.

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,480
 I loved it. I love striping that thing and edges,

385
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,120
 that thing and making it look plush.

386
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,120
 Like I prided myself on that green pillow top mattress I called my front yard

387
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,080
 and I so prided myself in it that I waged war on anything that would seek to

388
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,360
 kill it, which meant I took weeds very seriously.

389
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,280
 What's the best way to deal with weeds?

390
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,360
 You do not wait until they break through the soil.

391
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,040
 You address the issue before they ever even appear.

392
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,840
 You weed and feed. You do exactly what the Puritans used to say.

393
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,400
 Like you, you keep short accounts with both God and men

394
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,240
 because, and this is your second point,

395
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,800
 the only cure for a bitter spirit is a forgiving heart.

396
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,280
 The only cure for a bitter spirit is a forgiving heart,

397
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,520
 which is something we learn in chapter 42 as Joseph and his brothers,

398
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,960
 they finally collide.

399
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,560
 Like they come face to face for the very first time in 13 total years.

400
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,200
 After all of this estrangement, here they are face to face.

401
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,720
 And it's at this point in the story when famine has struck the land and it's

402
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,740
 caused Joseph's brothers to come to him that we read this in Genesis 42.

403
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,520
 Now Joseph was governor over the land.

404
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,680
 He was the one who sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brothers,

405
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,640
 they came and they bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.

406
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,840
 And Joseph saw his brothers and he recognized them,

407
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,920
 but he treated them like strangers. And he spoke roughly to them.

408
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,080
 Where do you come from? He said, they said from the land of Canaan to buy food.

409
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,960
 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.

410
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,880
 Why didn't they recognize him?

411
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,520
 Because a lot changes between 17 and 30 years old, right?

412
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,800
 And he was now an Egyptian, which meant that he had shaved his face.

413
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,840
 He had changed his clothes. He didn't look like them any longer.

414
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,880
 They did not recognize him.

415
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,360
 And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them.

416
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,720
 Those dreams, which God had given to him at one point in his story,

417
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,880
 before all of the betrayal began,

418
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,160
 those dreams where he saw 12 sheaves of wheat

419
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,960
 bowing down before him. He remembers it in this moment.

420
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,680
 And what he realizes is that dream wasn't about something in the past.

421
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,800
 That dream was about this moment right here and now.

422
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:13,600
 And what it helps him to realize is that he didn't arrive at this moment,

423
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,680
 tossed to and fro by the whims and will of man.

424
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,360
 He arrived at this moment by the working of God.

425
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,440
 Like it liberates him. It moves him out of,

426
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,320
 out of being a victim of bitterness.

427
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,720
 And it allows him to become an agent of forgiveness.

428
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,880
 He realizes in this moment that I've not been,

429
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,720
 I've not been under the thumb of men more powerful than me.

430
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,040
 I've been under the hand of a God more powerful than them.

431
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,720
 That God has been orchestrating my steps. He has been directing my movement.

432
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,800
 He has brought me to this moment right now.

433
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,480
 And so it enables me to leave my bitterness and take up my forgiveness.

434
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,520
 So what does it look like to forgive? What's it look like to forgive?

435
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,720
 How do we do it? Is it the act?

436
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,800
 Is it an act of the heart that you know what that hurt really bad?

437
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,680
 I don't hurt anymore.

438
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,800
 I've decided to put all that pain away and now I feel so good.

439
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,760
 I have such bliss because of you. Or is it an act of the mind that though,

440
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,560
 that does hurt so very bad.

441
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,800
 I will reason myself towards reconciliation.

442
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,280
 That is a preferred future and I will establish my steps to move that direction.

443
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,680
 No, it's neither of those things. Forgiveness is an act of the will.

444
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,640
 It's an act of the will.

445
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,680
 It's a choice to forgive the other person.

446
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,640
 And here's the thing like that can feel like, Oh,

447
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,400
 I'm just supposed to choose to forgive them. That can feel really disabling.

448
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,400
 And yet it's not disabling when you think about the motivation that undergirds

449
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,320
 that choice. Because when you make a choice to forgive,

450
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,400
 you do so on the basis of a love that transcends what they did to you and

451
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,080
 depends on what Christ did for you.

452
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,400
 That's why you can do it. Luke 7 47 says,

453
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,560
 therefore I tell you her sins, which are many, they're forgiven. Why?

454
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,440
 Because she loved much, but he was forgiven. Little loves little.

455
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,200
 You see,

456
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,880
 we're able to forgive because we have been forgiven ourselves.

457
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,840
 Not because we earned it or we deserved it,

458
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,960
 but simply because Christ chose to give it.

459
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,160
 That's why. So what does forgiveness look like?

460
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,080
 Forgiveness looks like setting your oppressor free. That's it.

461
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,120
 Forgiveness looks like setting your oppressor free.

462
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,880
 If you look at forgiveness in the Greek, it literally means to set free.

463
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,240
 Like that's the idea. Like forgiveness,

464
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,720
 it doesn't use its power to make that person pay or it doesn't keep them

465
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,720
 underneath your thumb. It doesn't keep score against them.

466
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,920
 It doesn't hold a grudge.

467
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,800
 It doesn't pray to God to strike them down at some point in the future.

468
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,520
 That's not what forgiveness does. No.

469
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,800
 Forgiveness releases them from your hate.

470
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,160
 It liberates them from their shame.

471
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,960
 It frees them from their failure.

472
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,040
 And the reason we know that is because this is what Christ has done for us.

473
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,400
 He has forgiven us our worst selves.

474
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,560
 Like the watershed of grace covers,

475
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,960
 not just some of your sin, brother, sister, it covers all of it.

476
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,120
 It covers every part of your story,

477
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,480
 especially the parts that you cringe the most over.

478
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,360
 And because we've been forgiven like that, we forgive like that. Now,

479
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,840
 am I saying that people shouldn't be held accountable for their actions? No,

480
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,600
 of course not. Truthfully,

481
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,080
 everyone needs to be held accountable for their evil and some should face

482
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,760
 prosecution if it's criminal or if it's abusive. But here's the thing, porch.

483
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,520
 The goal is never retribution.

484
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,240
 That's always rehabilitation. Like it's not, you did this to me.

485
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,280
 Now look what I'm going to do to you. That's not the heart of forgiveness.

486
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,880
 So the heart of forgiveness is I want to help you get better.

487
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,640
 Like I want to do what is loving towards you,

488
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,920
 which means I'm going to give you an upward hand.

489
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,960
 I'm going to move you to a new station in life.

490
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,760
 I'm going to help you become who Christ wants you to become.

491
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,760
 That's why Jesus says in Matthew 18, if your brother sins against you,

492
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,880
 go and tell him his fault between you and him alone,

493
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,160
 which I think is really important because we often want to tell everybody else.

494
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,440
 But when someone offends you, the goal would be to go and tell,

495
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,160
 go and tell them directly between you and them alone.

496
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,760
 And the reason you do it is because if they listen to you,

497
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,960
 you've gained your brother. Do you see it?

498
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,240
 Like the motive behind accountability, it's not vengeance.

499
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,440
 It's not to get back at someone. It's to win them over. It's to help them out.

500
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,880
 It's to lead them to life. It's to ultimately make them more like Christ.

501
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,280
 Like it's a desire for the restoration of the individual.

502
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,840
 And it's a desire for the reconciliation of the relationship.

503
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,880
 But here's what you need to know. Forgiveness,

504
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 it is the precursor to reconciliation, but where forgiveness is a choice,

505
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,040
 reconciliation is a process because reconciliation is a process more than a

506
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,200
 decision. Your third point for the night.

507
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,760
 Reconciliation is a process more than a decision where forgiveness is an act of

508
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,120
 the will. Reconciliation is an act of wisdom.

509
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,400
 We see it in Joseph's own story.

510
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,280
 Like he realizes that God has been in control this entire time,

511
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,280
 that everything that's come to pass has been under the rule and the reign of

512
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,680
 God's own sovereignty. And we learn like in chapter 42,

513
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,760
 he forgives them from his heart.

514
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,160
 But it's not until chapter 45 that the two disparate parties are actually

515
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,640
 reconciled to one another. Why? Like, why did it take three extra chapters?

516
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,440
 Why couldn't he have done it all in chapter 42?

517
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,280
 Why did he have to wait until chapter 45 to get to a place where he could

518
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,480
 forgive his brother and reconcile the relationship?

519
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,360
 Because he needed to,

520
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,640
 he needed to know that they were ready to reconcile themselves.

521
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,680
 He needed to know that they were safe to be reconciled to.

522
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,480
 And some of you need to know that tonight.

523
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,760
 Like you're in the midst of an estranged relationship,

524
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,880
 whether it's from a parent or it's an old romantic interest,

525
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,640
 or it's a brother or a sister or someone in your community that you're

526
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,280
 no longer friends with, whatever the nature of your estranged relationship,

527
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,160
 you're in a position tonight where you're longing for some kind of reconciliation.

528
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,160
 Like you want to bury the hatchet. You want to go back to the way things were.

529
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,600
 You want to go further than the way things were.

530
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,080
 You want to be better than it ever was before.

531
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,720
 And yet what you need to know is that they're safe to be reconciled to.

532
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,320
 If you're here and you're the offending party, you need to consider,

533
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,320
 what does it look like for me to grow in a way that demonstrates to the other

534
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,720
 that I'm safe to be with, that I'm someone you can trust, that I have matured.

535
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,360
 I have learned, I have surpassed my selfishness.

536
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,680
 What we learn,

537
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,720
 and I'm so grateful that this is what happens in Joseph's story is we actually

538
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,440
 get a picture of what it looks like to move towards reconciliation.

539
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,120
 And we learned that it's two things that it's A plus B equals C that point one

540
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,320
 and point two is going to equal reconciliation. So what are the two points?

541
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,080
 Point one is that you have to test, improve the individual.

542
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,320
 You have to test, improve. We won't read it for the sake of time,

543
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,160
 but chapters 42, 43 and 44,

544
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,320
 they're all about the process Joseph goes through to discern if his brothers are

545
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,160
 safe enough to reconcile with. It's fascinating.

546
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,520
 Like he's so thoughtful about the way he tests improves his brothers.

547
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,800
 Like first he claims as they come to him in chapter 42,

548
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,520
 you're here to spy out the land of Egypt,

549
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,480
 which is a reflection of their claim that he came to spy them out for the sake

550
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,560
 of their father. Next,

551
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,560
 he binds one of their brothers Simeon before their eyes to be left in a foreign

552
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
 land,

553
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,880
 which parallels perfectly the fact that he was bound to be sent into a foreign

554
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,240
 land himself. As you move on from there,

555
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,880
 you find that as they go to prepare to return to Canaan,

556
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,840
 he has his servants secretly put money into their sacks so that as they make the

557
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,720
 journey home, they'll find that they were paid.

558
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,000
 How do we even get this money?

559
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,120
 And the reason he does it is because when they sold him off,

560
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,800
 they had money from the exchange.

561
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,600
 They went home with money in their sack. It doesn't just stop there.

562
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,360
 Like once they returned to Egypt with their youngest and most beloved brother,

563
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,200
 Benjamin,

564
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,080
 Joseph sets him up that youngest and most beloved brother to appear as if he

565
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
 stole this silver cup,

566
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,080
 Joseph's own cup to test whether or not the brothers would sell him out the way

567
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,200
 they sold him out to save their own hide.

568
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,520
 Why is Joseph doing all that? Is he just trying to get his pound of flesh?

569
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,440
 He's trying to help them live through some semblance of what he himself

570
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,840
 suffered. No, that's not what he's trying to do.

571
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,320
 He is trying to take them back to the same scenario they once lived through

572
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,640
 together to see how they respond. Hey,

573
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
 in the face of a very similar situation,

574
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,920
 do you respond with violence and aggression and selfishness or do you respond

575
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,960
 differently? Have you changed? Have you matured?

576
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,040
 Have you grown and transformed?

577
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,400
 Are you worthy of my trust today because you weren't worthy of it then,

578
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
 but I'm willing to consider if you're worthy of it now because I want us to be

579
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,920
 reconciled to one another. He tests and he proves him.

580
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,080
 Here's what you need to know, Porch. If you're wanting for reconciliation,

581
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,800
 then you have to understand what I mean by testing and proving.

582
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,200
 It is not a sufficient justification for reconciliation to hear someone say,

583
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,960
 man, I know what I did was wrong and I really want to do better.

584
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,280
 That's not enough. It's not enough to have really well-meaning intentions.

585
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,680
 No, there needs to be faithful action behind it.

586
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,840
 Now,

587
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,560
 as they work to attest to the quality of their character and the consistency of

588
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,000
 their godliness, you pray for them. You wait with them. You see,

589
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,920
 if you go and you read a story, Joseph breaks bread with his brothers.

590
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,320
 He enjoys their company. He does so in safe spaces,

591
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,880
 but he doesn't rush to reconciliation because he needs to test and prove that

592
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,160
 they are who he needs them to be. And you have to do the same.

593
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,320
 So the first thing you have to do is you have to test and prove.

594
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,960
 The second thing that must be true is there must be grace and truth.

595
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,680
 That's what we see in chapter 45. If you jump ahead a little bit,

596
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,120
 like after Joseph has tested and proven that his brothers are in fact safe to

597
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,120
 reconcile with, we read this verse three, and Joseph said to his brothers,

598
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,360
 I'm Joseph. Like, is my father still alive? But his brothers,

599
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,760
 they could not answer him for they were dismayed at his presence. You know,

600
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,360
 they were caught. Oh my gosh, you're him. Like you're the guy that we sold off.

601
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,720
 Oh my God. Like what's going to happen to us. And yet he looks at me and says,

602
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,640
 no, come near to me, please. And they came near and he said,

603
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,080
 I'm your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.

604
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,680
 And now don't be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here

605
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,280
 for God sent me before you to preserve life.

606
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,960
 What's Joseph do? He speaks the truth to him.

607
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,880
 He tells them what happened.

608
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,480
 He tells them the God's honest truth of everything he endured,

609
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,000
 but not because he's trying to heap up guilt on them. Man, look what you guys did.

610
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,320
 Look what you made me live through. How could you, how dare you?

611
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,560
 He doesn't do that. He tells them the truth, not just once.

612
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,360
 He tells them twice that they sold him into Egypt

613
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,560
 because it's only when the truth is known,

614
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,120
 can grace respond.

615
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,080
 Like he doesn't tell them because he wants them to be filled with guilt.

616
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,840
 He tells them because he wants to flood them with grace.

617
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,080
 That's why he does it. And that's what we have to do.

618
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,080
 We must be willing to speak the truth because then it prepares space for grace

619
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,360
 to invade. It's really interesting.

620
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,680
 As you study the reconciliation account of Joseph,

621
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,600
 what you realize is that over the course of chapters 42 to 50,

622
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,680
 he cries seven different times.

623
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,440
 If you're a Bible nerd, you're going to love this.

624
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,560
 I think this is the coolest thing ever because if you track those different

625
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,680
 crying accounts, what you realize is they have a chiastic structure,

626
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,520
 which just simply means they are all pointing to the main idea of the story.

627
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,440
 And so when you look at it, the first time he cries,

628
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,240
 mirrors the seventh time he cries.

629
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,120
 The second time he cries mirrors the sixth time he cries.

630
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,280
 The third time mirrors the fifth and the one that has no reflection that is the

631
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,200
 main point,

632
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,920
 that is the hinge upon which the entire story is turning is the fourth time he

633
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,920
 cries. And what you realize is it's in verse 15.

634
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,520
 It's right after he has told them the truth of what they did and he has made

635
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
 space for grace to invade.

636
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,760
 We read this in verse 15 and he kissed all his brothers and he wept upon them.

637
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,200
 After that, his brothers talked with him.

638
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,720
 Like this is the marquee moment of their reconciliation.

639
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,640
 That's what this moment signifies.

640
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,120
 That's what this chiasm has been pointing to that they are going to be

641
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,840
 reconciled to one another,

642
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,040
 which can fill some of us with so much hope.

643
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,800
 Like we're here tonight and we do have an estranged relationship in our life and

644
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,680
 a strange relationship with a parent or a sibling, whoever it may be.

645
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,600
 And we're like, God, like there is hope for me.

646
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,280
 We can be reconciled. And yet for some of you,

647
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,600
 you hear that and all you feel is hopelessness

648
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,440
 because for whatever reason,

649
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,520
 reconciliation is not an option for you at this time.

650
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,000
 You see,

651
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,360
 the reason it isn't is because either you can't reconcile or you won't reconcile.

652
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,920
 So let me speak to you in the room. If that's you tonight,

653
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,600
 if you can't reconcile,

654
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,600
 then what you need to know is that you have to trust the Lord.

655
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,920
 Like if you can't reconcile because they're not around anymore,

656
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,640
 because a parent has since died and they've moved on or because they don't care

657
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,920
 anymore, they've abandoned you and they've left you all alone.

658
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,920
 If the reason you are unable to seek reconciliation is because it's just not

659
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
 possible, you cannot do it.

660
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,440
 Then what you have to know is you must trust the Lord.

661
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,360
 You have to trust the Lord. That's the appropriate response.

662
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,760
 Because here's the thing, Porch.

663
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,120
 If you study the scriptures and you track where everything is heading,

664
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,080
 God is going to reconcile everything at some point in the future.

665
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,600
 He is going to right every wrong. He is going to wipe every tear.

666
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,920
 He is going to make things well again.

667
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,040
 And so if you're here and you can't reconcile, then just know this.

668
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,520
 He can for you. He will do it.

669
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,360
 He will face your injustices on your behalf.

670
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,320
 For others of you, you're here and you won't reconcile.

671
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,480
 Like Kyle, you don't know what they did to me.

672
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,000
 Like you don't know where they took me, what they did to me,

673
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,160
 the way they invaded my privacy, the way that they controlled my life,

674
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,360
 the way they pushed me underneath their will.

675
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,680
 They subjected me to their oppression. You don't know.

676
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,720
 I'm not going to forgive them. I won't do it. It is insane what they did.

677
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,680
 What you need is grace. That's what you need.

678
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,640
 And I'm not rushing you to that end, but I am saying

679
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,680
 you have a high King in heaven who knows full well what it feels like to be

680
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,800
 betrayed, slandered,

681
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,960
 mocked, scorned, spit upon.

682
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,880
 And totally,

683
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,280
 totally asundered.

684
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,640
 He had grace for them.

685
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:48,040
 There's a scripture that says he wants all people to come to the knowledge of his

686
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,520
 repentance.

687
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,600
 And that includes the person that perpetuated whatever that insidious evil is

688
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,440
 against you.

689
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,440
 So you have grace for them because your King has grace for them too.

690
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,360
 And yet there are some of us here that aren't filled with hopelessness at the

691
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,640
 thought of this. You're filled with hope.

692
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,840
 And yet what you need to know is you consider the thought of like, man,

693
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,800
 I can reconcile and things can be great again. We can move back,

694
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,400
 not just to where they've been, but we can go forward to where it should be.

695
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,720
 What you need to know is reconciliation is not going to be perfect.

696
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,320
 Like if you track the story of Joseph and his brothers,

697
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,720
 what you see is it's not just five pages away.

698
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,880
 There's a rift in the family again.

699
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,040
 That as you come to the end of Genesis in chapter 50,

700
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,360
 you find that his brothers,

701
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,160
 they're terrified because their father has gone to be with the Lord.

702
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,360
 He has passed away. And as they look at Joseph, they're like, man,

703
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,920
 he has no reason to treat us well any longer. Like dad's not here.

704
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,480
 He doesn't have to play nice anymore.

705
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,920
 He could have been doing this for dad all along, but now he could be rid of us.

706
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,040
 He could dispense of us. We don't know what he's going to do.

707
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,160
 They're wracked with fear. And yet Joseph tells them in the face of that fear,

708
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,800
 he says in Genesis 50, do not fear.

709
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,240
 For am I in the place of God? As for you, you meant evil against me,

710
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,080
 but God,

711
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,360
 God meant it for good to bring it about that many people should be kept alive

712
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,720
 as they are today. Joseph says, God rules my life.

713
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,040
 Like he ruled it to this day and he will rule it for all my days.

714
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 And even though there were times in the past that were hard,

715
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,200
 look at the way he's restored it. Look at the way he's redeemed it.

716
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,360
 I have a story, the likes of which only God could write. I trust him.

717
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,480
 I don't trust myself. Am I in the place of God? No, you're safe with me.

718
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,400
 God has been good no matter what may come.

719
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,640
 Even when our father passes and future adversity prevails,

720
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,560
 I know that my hope is secure,

721
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,440
 that I have a steadfast promise, that I have a truth which is trustworthy

722
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,360
 because God is with me. Do you know that?

723
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,200
 Do you know that for yourself that God is with you?

724
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:11,200
 And so as you move forward in life and you face the estrangements in your story

725
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,320
 and you seek after reconciliation,

726
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,720
 that no matter what is ahead, God will provide. He'll take care of you.

727
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,960
 You see, that's not just the narrative of Joseph's story.

728
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,280
 That is the narrative of Jesus's story.

729
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,280
 That every one of us, we were estranged from God.

730
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,720
 We were separated in our sin.

731
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,680
 We were totally alienated from his presence.

732
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,880
 And yet what you know is that Adam and Eve, our father and mother,

733
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,640
 sin against God and they're sent away from him and they move to the East.

734
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,240
 God goes with them.

735
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,280
 That God's heart was never to have distance between you and him,

736
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,200
 but his heart was to bridge the gap.

737
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,280
 And he planned it from the very beginning of the Bible.

738
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,400
 That he always wanted to build a bridge and make a way for you to come home to

739
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,560
 him again. That estrangement wouldn't be your story.

740
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,640
 And the reason we know is because he never abandoned us.

741
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,960
 Like Jesus Christ came for us when we were worthy of being

742
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,480
 abandoned. And he didn't just come to be with us,

743
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,000
 but he came to save us,

744
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,960
 to cure the bitterness of our sin through his forgiving work on the

745
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,080
 cross, by absorbing into himself all the consequence of your sin.

746
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,840
 Did you know like your sin is worthy of eternal damnation?

747
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,200
 And yet Christ said, I don't want that for you.

748
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,840
 I will take that instead.

749
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,280
 I will absorb the wrath of God into me that you might have

750
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,920
 reconciliation with God instead,

751
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,080
 that you can have relationship to him instead that you can receive his love

752
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,040
 instead.

753
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,760
 And in his resurrection, Jesus has reconciled us.

754
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,800
 That any who would place their faith in him,

755
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,840
 they would be restored in full working right,

756
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,640
 in a wonderful relationship to God.

757
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,840
 If you're here and you're considering the estranged relationships in your story,

758
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,400
 the first thing you must consider

759
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,800
 is whether or not you're estranged from God.

760
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,240
 His heart is to be reunited to you.

761
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:28,720
 We have to first approach him before we can approach anyone else.

762
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,600
 Let me pray for us. God, we're so grateful for this evening.

763
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,800
 Thank you God for just being kind to us.

764
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,560
 That's the story of the gospel.

765
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,640
 You're kind and merciful and loving and gracious God.

766
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,080
 And we know you never abandoned us.

767
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,440
 That when we went far off, you did not leave us alone, but you chased us down.

768
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,680
 You raced after us and you are God's seeking to bring us home.

769
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,320
 I pray God if there are friends here tonight that do not know you before they

770
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,400
 would consider any other relationship, they would just consider you.

771
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,480
 That God they have to get a relationship with you before God,

772
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,440
 they can have a relationship with others.

773
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:14,200
 Lord, I know this idea of estrangement, it's such a painful concept.

774
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,080
 As we sing this last song, Lord,

775
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,840
 I pray that you would be near to the broken heart of the God.

776
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,520
 You would save the crushed in spirit that those who are here and they are

777
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,240
 wildly estranged from someone,

778
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:35,280
 they might sense your kindness near to them this evening in greater measure than

779
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,000
 they ever have before. We love you, Lord. And it is in Christ's name we pray.

780
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,160
 Amen.
