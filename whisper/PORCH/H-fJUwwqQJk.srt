 [music]

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Well, what's up, Porch? How we doing tonight?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey, it's so good to see you. Welcome.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm glad you made it.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 If this is your first time ever with us on a Tuesday,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday evening.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We've got a QR code on the screen.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We would love to connect with you

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 and just help this place feel like home very quickly.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I also just want to say hello to all of our Porch Live locations

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 that are watching with us tonight.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I'm looking at you, Porch Live Cincinnati,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Porch Live Des Moines,

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 and for the first time ever, Porch Live Fresno,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 thank you for joining us.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Hope all is well with you guys.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Tonight, we are continuing our series that we are calling "Glory,"

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 and we have been walking through the Gospel of John.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And the best way for me to start

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 is by just sharing with you what happened on my sixth date

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 with my wife, Catherine.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 So after five dates, we reached the sixth date,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 and I realized that it was time for us to have

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 a clarifying conversation in our relationship

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 that some people know as the DTR,

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 which stands for "defining the relationship."

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And the way that I planned to have this clarifying conversation

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 with Catherine was I planned to do it at a concert,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 specifically a U2 concert.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Some of you--that's good to hear,

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 because if the next generation is like U who?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 U2, all right?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 People, go look them up. They'll change your life.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 But we went to this concert,

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 and I didn't know when I was going to do it.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I just knew it was going to happen at some point in the concert,

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and I just kind of wanted to let U2 lead the way.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And so we were in the concert.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 We were enjoying the concert.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 In the middle of the concert, Catherine said that she needed to go to the bathroom.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I said that I would go with her--not to the same restroom, obviously.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But we kind of did our separate things,

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 and I finished first,

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and I'm giving you way too much information.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 All of this has been unnecessary up until this point.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 This is where it actually gets important.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So...

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I am waiting on Catherine to come out,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 and I'm standing in, like, the breezeway,

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 the tunnel that takes you back to your seats,

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 and I'm listening to U2,

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 and U2 is playing this song that's called "Sunday Bloody Sunday."

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And I realized in that moment, this is it.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 This is when I'm going to have a DTR with Catherine.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 You might be wondering if "Sunday Bloody Sunday" is a romantic song.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 It is not.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 It is about people dying.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 But I realized that in this moment,

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 there's going to be a birth of a new relationship.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I don't know how to make that tie to "Sunday Bloody Sunday,"

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 but I realized that we're going to have a conversation.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So Catherine came out of the bathroom,

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 and we were about to go to our seats.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 U2 is playing "Sunday Bloody Sunday,"

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 and right there I just stopped her,

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 and I just said, "Hey!

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I need to tell you something!"

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I said, "I like you!"

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 She said, "I like you, too!"

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I was like, "I like you, too, but do you like me, too?"

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And she said, "This is what happened."

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I said, "I like you!"

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And she said, "I like you, too!"

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And I just froze, and I was like, "All right."

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 We just went back to our seats,

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 and we stood silently next to each other for about 20 minutes.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And that really--it was--

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 the reason I shared that night with you

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 is the real DTR in our relationship

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 happened while watching the animated movie "Chicken Little,"

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 but a U2 concert sounds way sexier,

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 so we'll just say that that was the moment.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 But my point in telling you all this

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 is that there came a time in our relationship

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 when Kat and I--when we were dating

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 where we just needed to have a clarifying conversation,

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 and when we clarified the status of the relationship,

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 that clarity led to confidence

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 because feelings were out on the table.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 We knew where each other stood.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 We knew where we were heading.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 We knew what we both desired,

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 and we both honestly knew

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 where the relationship was going to end up.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And that clarity led to confidence.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 And yet I've been in other situations.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Like, for example, I've shared here at the porch

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 about the time where the girl didn't know

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 if she wanted to keep dating me

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 because she didn't know if she liked how I looked.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Did I tell you all that story?

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I told you all about that, right?

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Yeah, that was very unsettling.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 That lack of clarity

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 led to a lot of confusion and concern.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So clarity is a really good thing.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And the reason I tell you that

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 is because as we step back into the Gospel of John,

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 we are going to look at Jesus Christ

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 having a DTR with a guy named Nicodemus.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And this passage in the Scriptures

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 is so incredibly important

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 because what this passage does

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 is it drives towards relational clarity with Jesus Christ.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 My hope for you is that every person here tonight

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 would leave with great clarity on where you stand with Jesus

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 because when you have clarity on where you stand,

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 it can lead to confidence in your relationship with Jesus

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 and the relationship can really heat up

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 because you know where you stand,

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 you know how each other feels,

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 and you know where you're going.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 A question that we ask around here at the porch often is,

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 if you were to die tonight on a scale of one to ten,

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 how sure are you that you would go to heaven when you die?

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And I just want you to think real quick.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 What would your answer be?

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 One to ten.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Just put a number in your mind.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Have that number in your mind.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 What I hope is that many of you right now

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 are picturing the number ten.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But I would imagine that many people here

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 are seeing something different,

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 whether it's a nine or a 7.2 or a three.

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 I want you to be a ten.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Like I want you to have complete confidence

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 in where you stand with Jesus Christ.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But the only way for you to have that confidence

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 is you need clarity on where your relationship stands.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Now some of you have been walking with Jesus for a long time

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 and so you're like, "This is where we're going tonight?

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 "This is what all we're talking about

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 "is how to be sure that you're going to heaven?

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 "Here's what I need you to do.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 "I need you to hang on because we will go down

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 "a little bit of a theological rabbit hole."

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 So if that's kind of your thing,

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 you can buckle up for that.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 But my greatest hope here is if you personally

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 have great confidence in your relationship with Jesus,

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 if you already have that clarity,

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 then my hope tonight is that you might get equipped

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 in some way with an urgency to go out and help others

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 find that same clarity that would lead to the same

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 type of confidence that you yourself have.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So here we go, John chapter three is where we are going to be.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 If you have a Bible, join me there.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 John chapter three, this is a truly famous passage

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 in the scriptures where Jesus has a very, very important

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 conversation with a guy named Nicodemus.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And as we look at this passage, we're just going to identify

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 three things that you need in order to be saved.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Three things that you need in order to be saved.

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And it's going to give you the clarity that you need

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 on your relationship with Jesus Christ,

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 so hopefully you can move forward in confidence.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 The first thing that you need in order to be saved is this,

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 you need more than religion to be saved.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 You need more than religion to be saved.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Look with me at the passage, John chapter three,

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 let me read you verses one and two,

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 because it sets the scene for us.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 It says this, "Now there was a man of the Pharisees

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 This man came to Jesus by night and said to him,

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 'Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God,

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 for no one can do these signs that you do

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 unless God is with him.'"

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So this is a very important meeting,

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 it's happening at night, a guy named Nicodemus comes to Jesus.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 So here's what you need to know,

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 the name Nicodemus, it means conqueror of the people.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 That's what Nicodemus means, conqueror of the people.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 So even just by his name we get the idea

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 that this guy is a leader in the nation of Israel.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But not only that, what we found out in the first verse

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 is that Nicodemus is a Pharisee.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The word Pharisee, it literally means separated one.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So Nicodemus as a Pharisee is really separated

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 from the rest of society in the sense

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 that he is a professional rule follower.

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Like he is a part of a religious group

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 that spends all of their time

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 seeking to follow God's 613 rules

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 that are expressed in the Old Testament.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But here's what you need to know about Nicodemus and the Pharisees.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 They were so all in on following God's rules

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 that they created rules outside of God's rules

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 just to make sure that they did a good job

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 of following God's rules.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And so what do I mean by that?

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Well, for example, when it comes to the rule

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 of following and observing the Sabbath,

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 the Pharisees, according to one source,

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 had 24 chapters on how to observe the Sabbath.

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So that's Nicodemus.

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But not only that, what does it say about him?

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 It says at the end of verse 1

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 that he is a ruler of the Jews.

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 What that means is that Nicodemus

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 is probably a part of a group of people

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 known as the Sanhedrin,

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 which was 70 members that were,

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 in a sense, Israel's Supreme Court.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Not only that, in verse 10,

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Jesus refers to Nicodemus as the teacher of Israel.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So when you put all these things together,

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 what do we know about Nicodemus?

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 We know that Nicodemus is, he is an authority.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 He is a religious authority in Israel.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Like, he is the guy that people would be podcasting.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 He is the guy that people would be quoting and reposting.

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Nicodemus was a guy that everyone looked to

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 as a religious, as a definition of a person of God.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 So who would Nicodemus be today?

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Like, if Nicodemus walked into the porch,

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 what would he look like?

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Well, this would be a guy that in Christian circles

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 would be referred to as a stud or a mog, a man of God.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 This is a guy that would be at church every single Sunday.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Like, if he takes a road trip with his friends,

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 he's like, "Guys, I've got to be back either late Saturday night

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 or early Sunday morning because I'm at church.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Like, I'm not just going to, I'm not going to stream it.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Like, I'm going to be there for it."

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 He's at the porch every single Tuesday night.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 This is a guy that reads his Bible every single day.

239
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 This is a guy that memorizes Scripture every single week.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 This is a guy that sometimes just dates Jesus.

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 This is a guy that when he takes a girl out,

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 he's super intense.

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He's even intentional because that's how Christian guys are.

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 They're not, they, trying to be intentional just get intense.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And so they look a girl in the eyes on the first day

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 and they're like, "So tell me your story."

247
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And then they end the first day by saying, "I want to pursue you."

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And it just gets really weird really fast.

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 But that's, that's Nicodemus.

250
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Like, if he's going to cuss, he's going to say things like,

251
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 "What the French toast?"

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 "Son of a biscuit."

253
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And like, those, there's that purity of heart that like,

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 if something goes wrong, that's what comes out of his mouth.

255
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 This is who Nicodemus would be today.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And he's having a conversation with Jesus.

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 You look at a guy like Nicodemus and who I just described,

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 and it's like, yeah, that's the poster child of

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 what Christianity must look like.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And yet look at what Jesus says to him in verse 3.

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 "Jesus answers him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 What an interesting statement for Jesus to say

264
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 to this very well-respected religious figure.

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Here's what you need to know.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Nicodemus would have been viewed as an authority

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 on the kingdom of God.

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 The kingdom of God was, at least to Jews,

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 it was this idea of, at the end of time,

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 like this eternal resurrection life.

271
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Jews believed that they were an automatic shoe-in

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 to the kingdom of God unless they were especially evil

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 or had rejected God.

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 So if anyone knew about the kingdom of God,

275
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 it would have been Nicodemus.

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 The nation of Israel would have looked to Nicodemus

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 for teaching on the kingdom of God.

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And Jesus looks at Nicodemus in the eyes

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 and he is basically making the point,

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 not even you can make it into the kingdom of God

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 unless you're born again.

282
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 What is Jesus communicating to him?

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Jesus is having a DTR with him and he's just saying,

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 "Look, I want you to know where we stand.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I want you to be clear on your status

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 because the worst thing that could happen is

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 you move forward with a misplaced confidence."

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Jesus is in a sense telling him,

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 "I don't want you to think you're saved

290
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 when you're actually not."

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 His point is, "You need a lot more than religion

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 to be saved."

293
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So do you know what Nicodemus shows us?

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 What he's showing us is it is possible

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 to be an unsaved Christian.

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Now, some of you think I just spoke heresy,

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 so let me just clarify quickly.

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 What I mean when I say that it's possible

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 to be an unsaved Christian is I'm talking about

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 people in this room who consider themselves Christians

301
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 because they are religious.

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But in reality, they are not saved

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 because they don't actually have a saving relationship

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 with Jesus Christ.

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Now, hey, look, my goal tonight is to make--

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 my goal isn't to make truly saved people

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 really, really nervous.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 My goal is just to have a clarifying conversation

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 with a few of you.

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And so I just want to make sure that you're not

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 an unsaved Christian.

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So here's what I want you to do.

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 I just want you to put yourself in that place

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 late at night when you're laying in bed

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 and you've finally put your phone down

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 and on a rare occasion you can't sleep

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 because you are wondering about your eternal destiny.

318
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 I don't know if you've ever had that night.

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 That's a good night.

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 That's an important night for you to have.

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 But if in that moment, if you're wondering,

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 if you were to die, would you go to heaven,

323
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 are you asking the question, "Have I done enough?"

324
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 In that moment, are you asking, "Have I done enough?"

325
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Or are you asking the question, "Have I been good enough?"

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 If you've ever asked that question, "Have I done enough?

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Let me answer it for you."

328
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 No.

329
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 In fact, you can never do enough.

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 If you're asking the question, "Have I been good enough?

331
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Let me answer it for you."

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 No.

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 No, you haven't.

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And you know what?

335
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 You can never be good enough for God.

336
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 So that's clarity right there.

337
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Welcome to the porch.

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Aren't you glad you came?

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 You're not good enough and you haven't done enough.

340
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Man, what a polite crowd to applaud that.

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But man, this is where we can actually go somewhere.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Because the great news is that while you could never do enough for God,

343
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 the good news is that God has done everything for you.

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And even though you could never be good enough for God,

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 you know what the great news is?

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Is God has been good enough for you.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 In the person of Jesus Christ.

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 When we could do nothing, God did everything.

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He sent Jesus Christ into the world.

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 To do what?

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 To live the life that we couldn't.

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 The perfect life that God required.

353
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 He died a perfect death so that imperfect people could be made right

354
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 through His resurrection with a perfect God.

355
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 But if you're here tonight and you're wrestling with those questions,

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 have I done enough or am I good enough?

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I want you to see the fact that Nicodemus, this religious figure,

358
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 he came to visit Jesus at night.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And I loved what one commentator pointed out is that there's symbolism there.

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That he is coming to Jesus from darkness.

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 That a guy who believes he's living and knows the light is coming to the light

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 of the world in darkness.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 That his heart has never embraced the truth.

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And so I tell you that just to say it is possible to be religious and living

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 in darkness.

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It's possible to say you're a Christian and to think you're a Christian

367
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 and to not be a Christian.

368
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And I'll just say, look, my tendency is to be a rule follower.

369
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 My tendency is to figure out if I'm good with God based on how I am living.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And it's just so easy to find yourself in this place where you're like,

371
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 "Well, you know what?

372
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I'm not looking at porn.

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I'm not getting wasted.

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I'm not sleeping around and I go to the porch sometimes so I think I'm good."

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 You just need to make sure that God is in heaven looking at you saying,

376
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 "Yeah, you're good."

377
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Because the reality is I believe that God is saying no one is good.

378
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 The reason I believe that is because Romans chapter 3 actually says that.

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And so we have to start with the reality that you will need way more than religion

380
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 to be saved.

381
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Number two, you need a miracle to be saved.

382
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Like you need a miracle to be saved.

383
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Where do I get that from?

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Okay, look with me back at the text.

385
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Verse 3, look again at what Jesus said.

386
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 "Jesus answered him and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,

387
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'"

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 That word "again" in the original language of the Bible, which is Greek,

389
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 that word "again" can be translated from "above."

390
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 So I think it can carry both meanings.

391
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 What Jesus is communicating to this professional rule follower is no one can be saved

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 unless they have a second birth and are actually born from above.

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Every person that's going to be saved has to have two births,

394
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 a physical birth and then a spiritual birth.

395
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Look at how Nicodemus responds.

396
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Verse 4, "Nicodemus said to him, 'How can a man be born when he's old?

397
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?'"

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Now this isn't Nicodemus like genuinely wondering, like, "How does that work?

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Like, how do you kind of like fit up in there to like come back out?"

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Like, that's not what is happening here.

401
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 This is Nicodemus, a guy who thinks he knows everything.

402
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 And he is responding kind of sarcastically.

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 What are you even talking about?

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Are you talking crazy like, "Oh, you're going to climb back up in your mom

405
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 and then you're going to come back out."

406
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 But what I want you to see is his logic.

407
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Nicodemus is consumed with what man needs to do for God to be saved.

408
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Even in his sarcastic response, "Who is all the responsibility on?"

409
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 It's on the man.

410
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 "How can a man be born when he's old?

411
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"

412
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 All of the emphasis would be on the guy doing the work.

413
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And the point is that's impossible.

414
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Just like it's impossible for a man to climb back up into his mother's womb

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and be born again, it is impossible.

416
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 It is impossible for you to be saved without being born from above,

417
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 without a spiritual birth.

418
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 You need a miracle.

419
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Jesus goes on in verse 5, and he says the same thing he said in verse 3.

420
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Look at what he says.

421
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit,

422
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 he cannot enter the kingdom of God."

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 He's saying the same thing with new wording.

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Some people think that he's talking about baptism here.

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 I don't think he is.

426
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 See, water in the Old Testament was symbolic for cleansing,

427
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and Spirit was symbolic of new life.

428
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And so what Jesus is saying is, he's like, "Unless you're cleansed by God

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and unless you're given new life by God, you can't enter the kingdom of God."

430
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 So then in verse 6, he says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh.

431
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."

432
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 So his point is, look, you have to have two births.

433
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 You need to be born of the flesh as a human being,

434
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 but then you have to be born of the Spirit.

435
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 The Spirit of God actually has to do a miraculous work in you.

436
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 So here's the theological rabbit hole.

437
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Here's a big theological word that's important for you to know.

438
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 What Jesus is unpacking here is known as the theological idea

439
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 of regeneration of the Spirit of God.

440
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 What does regeneration mean?

441
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Well, let me just read you what two scholars, how they've defined regeneration.

442
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 So for those of you that like kind of the theological rabbit hole,

443
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 this is your moment, and if you're kind of not into that,

444
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 try and hang in there anyway, because this is so important.

445
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Wayne Grudem, who has kind of written the standard text

446
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 on what is known as systematic theology.

447
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Some of you are like, "You are giving me so much stuff

448
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 that I don't want to know right now."

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 But here's what Wayne Grudem says about regeneration.

450
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 He says, "Regeneration is a secret act of God

451
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 in which he imparts new spiritual life to us."

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Bruce Demarest puts it this way,

453
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 "Regeneration is that work of the Spirit at conversion

454
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 that renews the heart and life, the inner self,

455
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 thus restoring the person's intellectual, volitional, moral, emotional,

456
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 and relational capacities to do what?

457
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 To know, love, and serve God."

458
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So do you understand what's happening here?

459
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 When Jesus says you have to be born again,

460
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 he really is saying a miracle has to happen.

461
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 God has to do something miraculous through his Spirit in your life.

462
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 So no one here who is a Christian,

463
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 you're not a Christian simply because you heard the gospel,

464
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 you evaluated the gospel, and you decided to choose God.

465
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 That's part of it.

466
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Part of it, the way God works is you come to a place like this

467
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and you hear the gospel, and you respond to the gospel.

468
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But as you're hearing the gospel and responding to the gospel,

469
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 which is what you should do,

470
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 a miracle is taking place in your heart.

471
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 The Spirit of God is awakening your mind and your heart

472
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 to embrace the truth and to receive Jesus.

473
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 This is the idea of regeneration.

474
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 So if you're a Christian, you just need to know

475
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 you are actually a walking miracle, and God gets the credit for you.

476
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And some of you are like, "I don't know what I think about what you're saying."

477
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Well, think about physical birth.

478
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 If you were to walk up to me afterward, and you were to ask me,

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "Hey, where were you born?"

480
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Would it be weird to you if I was like,

481
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 "You know what, I chose to be born in Dallas."

482
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Wouldn't you be like, "Really?"

483
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 No, I don't take credit for where I was born.

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Carla Atik gets the credit for that.

485
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Okay?

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I was born in Medical City right down the street.

487
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I did not choose Medical City.

488
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 That is the place that my mom chose to give birth to me.

489
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 The Scriptures, the reason that you have to understand it's a miracle

490
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 is that the story of every Christian is not that you are a bad person

491
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 and now you have become a good person.

492
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 The story is you were a dead person, and now you are an alive person.

493
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And you are alive because when you were dead,

494
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 God did a miracle so that you could go from death to life.

495
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 So you need a miracle.

496
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And you know what the good news is?

497
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 God loves doing miracles.

498
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 And He's doing a miracle in some of your hearts tonight.

499
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Like some of you just heard me talk about you needing more than religion to be saved,

500
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 and you're like, "He's talking about me tonight!"

501
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 You know what's happening?

502
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 A miracle is happening.

503
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Regeneration is happening.

504
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 God is calling you to Himself tonight.

505
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Tonight you're going to walk out of this place,

506
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 and you're going to be able to say, "I showed up dead, and I left alive.

507
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 This was a great Tuesday night."

508
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 [Applause]

509
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Now I want you to see what Jesus says in verses 7 and 8.

510
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Because what I want you to--this is where--

511
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Again, I'm not trying to cause unnecessary concern,

512
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 and yet I am trying to fight for clarity.

513
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 I'm trying to prompt a DTR between you and Jesus,

514
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 because Jesus says something very important here in verses 7 and 8

515
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 that has everything to do with you needing a miracle to be saved.

516
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Because in verse 7 He says, "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'

517
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear it sound,

518
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.

519
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit."

520
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 What is He saying there?

521
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He's saying, "Think about the wind.

522
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 You can't see the wind, and yet you can hear it, and you can see its effects.

523
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 You can look at the trees, and you can say, 'There is wind.

524
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I can't see it, but I know it is at work.'"

525
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And so Jesus' point is, when a miracle takes place,

526
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 you can't see the Spirit, you can't even completely understand how the Spirit is working,

527
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 and yet you know it when a miracle has taken place, because something changes.

528
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 So the reason that that is important is if you--

529
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 if God has done a miracle in your life, if He's given you new life,

530
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 then there should be some signs of life.

531
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Like, I remember when one of our kids was born,

532
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 he came out of the womb, and they put him on cat,

533
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 and he was laying there making no sound.

534
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 He looked lifeless.

535
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Like, it was deafening silence in the delivery room.

536
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And then they prompted him, and he began to cry,

537
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 and it was the best sound that we could have heard.

538
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Why? Because there were signs of life.

539
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 We knew that he was alive.

540
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And I tell you that just to say, "Look, there's going to be times in the Christian life where you struggle.

541
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 There's going to be times absolutely where you have doubts.

542
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 There's going to be times where you might even look lifeless,

543
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 and you're going to come to the porch,

544
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 and you just need to be spurred on and kind of stimulated to go and walk closer with Jesus

545
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 so that there's more signs of life."

546
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 But my point in telling you this is if you consider yourself a Christian

547
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 and you prayed a prayer once, or you raised your hair somewhere,

548
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 or raised not your hair but your hands somewhere,

549
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 or you got baptized when you were an infant,

550
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 but you consistently look spiritually dead,

551
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 meaning there is no real desire to know Jesus,

552
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 there is no real love or appreciation for Jesus,

553
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 there's no real desire to learn the ways of Jesus,

554
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 and live life with Jesus,

555
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 then it is at least worth evaluating.

556
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 If a miracle has ever taken place.

557
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I remember getting a note from a guy who trusted Christ.

558
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Here's what he said.

559
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 He said, "I was overcome by a world of joy.

560
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 I found my Lord and Savior for the first time in my life.

561
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 I have clarity and I'm at peace.

562
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 God broke chains that were keeping me a prisoner to my past.

563
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 These were chains that I thought were too strong for me or anyone else.

564
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Man, I was wrong.

565
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I want to spend the rest of my life serving our Lord and Savior and all that I do.

566
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I want to plant the seed in others just like you and countless others did for me.

567
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 A fire is burning in my heart for the first time."

568
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Do you know what he's articulating?

569
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 He's just articulating, "Hey, a miracle has happened in my life.

570
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Please don't hear me say that you won't struggle as a Christian.

571
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 You will. In this world, you will have trouble."

572
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And here's the other thing I want you to hear.

573
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 You will never have to beg God to make you alive.

574
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Never.

575
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 You'll never have to beg God to make you alive.

576
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 If you're begging God to make you alive, you probably already are alive.

577
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And you should take joy in that.

578
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 So, three things.

579
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Number one, you need more than religion to be saved.

580
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Number two, you need a miracle to be saved.

581
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And then number three, you need a biblical faith in Jesus to be saved.

582
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 You need a--and the key here is you need a biblical faith in Jesus to be saved.

583
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Where do I get that from? Look with me.

584
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 Verses 9 through 13.

585
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 It says, "Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can these things be?'

586
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Jesus answered him, 'Are you the teacher of Israel?

587
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And yet you do not understand these things?

588
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen,

589
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 but you do not receive our testimony.

590
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe,

591
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?'"

592
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man.

593
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 This is so powerful, guys. Don't miss what's happening here.

594
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Nicodemus is like, "I don't know what you're talking about."

595
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And Jesus is like, "Really?

596
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Like, you're the one teaching the country about the kingdom of God."

597
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And Jesus is saying, "Let me just tell you what has happened here."

598
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 He says, "I am the only one," because there was this belief in Judaism

599
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 that some bygone saints had ascended into heaven

600
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and received special insights into God's ways and plans.

601
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And Jesus is like, "Look, I just want to be clear.

602
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I am the only one who started out there and came down here.

603
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 People might leave here to go there,

604
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 but I'm the only one who started out there and came down to here."

605
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And he refers to himself as the Son of Man.

606
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Do you know why that's important?

607
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 That's actually a reference to the Old Testament, Daniel chapter 7,

608
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and it's a reference to kingship.

609
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 So when Jesus refers to himself as the Son of Man,

610
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 he's referring to himself as the king of God's kingdom.

611
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 They're talking about how to get into the kingdom of God.

612
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And Demas would have been an authority on the kingdom of God.

613
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And Jesus is basically saying, "Look, dude,

614
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 the king of the kingdom is standing here telling you the truth."

615
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 And you're like, "No, I don't know. We'll see."

616
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 He's like, "Something's off here. You're not getting it."

617
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And he's saying, "Look, if you don't understand the elementary things

618
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 that I'm telling you, that you have to be born again to enter the kingdom,

619
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 then how in the world is your mind going to comprehend truly heavenly things?"

620
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 He's saying, "Look, I came from heaven.

621
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I know the Spirit of God because the Spirit of God and I are one.

622
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 I know that the Spirit of God has come to give new life to people.

623
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 I was there in heaven. I'm one with God. I know what's happening."

624
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And yet you, Nicodemus, are standing here saying, "Yeah, I don't get it."

625
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And that just goes back to the first point, that a miracle has to take place.

626
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 I shared with you guys earlier this year that I want to become the goat

627
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 in the 42-year-old age bracket of tennis in Richardson, Texas.

628
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And it's a long journey for me.

629
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 But when I really got back into tennis at the age of 40,

630
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I started taking lessons from this person.

631
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 I was two lessons in. I barely knew what I was doing.

632
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 But I then began to try and teach my 9-year-old how to play tennis.

633
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And so we were in the front yard, and he started holding the racket

634
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 with his pointer finger along the racket.

635
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And I was like, "Hey, dude, you're not holding the racket right."

636
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And he was like, "Yes, I am!"

637
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 This is what he said.

638
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 He's like, "I'm holding it right!" I was like, "Dude, no, you're not."

639
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 He's like, "Yes, I am! I'm holding it right!"

640
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 I was like, "No, dude, you're running your pointer finger along the racket."

641
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 He's like, "No, I'm not!"

642
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 I was like, "Dude, I watched you do it."

643
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 He was like, "No, I didn't!"

644
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 I was like, "OK."

645
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 And so then he hit another ball, and he did it again.

646
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 I was like, "Hey, hey, look! Look at your grip!"

647
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 And he looked down, and he goes,

648
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 "Oh."

649
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 And I was like, "You ever read the story of Nicodemus?"

650
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 "Not really, I didn't do that."

651
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 But he became a Christian right then, and it was a really powerful moment.

652
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 It's the same thing with Nicodemus.

653
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 It's like, "Hey, dude, if you won't even accept what I'm teaching you

654
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 about how to hold a tennis racket, it doesn't get any more elementary than that.

655
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 If you won't accept that, how in the world are we going to begin

656
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 to be able to talk about forehands or backhands or spin or anything like that?"

657
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 And it's the same thing with Nicodemus here.

658
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 He's like, "Look, if you won't understand that at the base level,

659
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 you have to understand that religion will not get you there,

660
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 and a miracle has to take place, and you're just not going to get it.

661
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 A miracle has to happen. Eyes have to be opened."

662
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 And so what has to happen is you have to come to a place

663
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 where you realize that Jesus Christ is the King of the kingdom.

664
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 And what Jesus is saying is, "Look, I'm telling you the truth.

665
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 You have to come to a place.

666
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 When I talk about having a biblical faith in Jesus,

667
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I'm talking about coming to a place where you trust what Jesus has said.

668
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 And you embrace it, you accept it.

669
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Like, for example, Jesus declares in John 10, 30, "I and the Father are one."

670
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 That is Jesus declaring that He is in fact God.

671
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 John 14, 6, Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.

672
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 No one comes to the Father except through Me."

673
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Do you believe that?

674
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 John 3, 3, "Truly I say to you, unless one is born again,

675
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 he can't see the kingdom of God."

676
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Do you believe that?

677
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 A biblical faith doesn't sit there and say,

678
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 "Well, you know what, that's good for you, and that might be true for you,

679
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 and I might believe something different,

680
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 but we all, in the end, we end up at the same place."

681
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 No, you either believe that Jesus is the King of the kingdom,

682
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 which means He is the holder of truth.

683
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 And if He says it, it's right, or not.

684
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 A biblical faith sees Jesus as the truth.

685
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 If Jesus is the truth, then to reject any of Him is to reject all of Him.

686
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Do you hear what I'm saying?

687
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 To reject any of Jesus is to reject all of Him.

688
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 To only accept Jesus as Savior,

689
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 but to refuse to acknowledge Him as King is to reject Jesus.

690
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 To know Jesus as a way, but not the way, is to reject Jesus.

691
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 To know Jesus as a good man or a prophet,

692
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 but not God Himself is to reject Jesus.

693
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 Do you know the true Jesus?

694
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And then look at how Jesus finishes in verses 14 and 15.

695
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 He says, "And as Moses," this is so interesting,

696
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 He says, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,

697
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

698
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life."

699
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Here's what Jesus is doing here.

700
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 He's reaching back into the Old Testament in the book of Numbers

701
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 that I'm sure all of y'all are reading in your quiet times right now.

702
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Numbers 21, it's a story about the nation of Israel

703
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 being disobedient to God,

704
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 and God punishes them for their disobedience.

705
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 And it's kind of this interesting story where God sends some snakes to bite Him,

706
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 and because of the venom, people of the nation of Israel die.

707
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 And you might hear that and think, "Well, that's super harsh.

708
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 That's why I can't believe in God."

709
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 No, you have to understand, it's not harsh.

710
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 It's just.

711
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Because if God is holy, holy, holy, like we just sang that He is,

712
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 if He is perfect and right and true,

713
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 then to just turn a blind eye and just let people have their way

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 would be unjust.

715
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 No, He executes justice.

716
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 And at the same time, you know what He does?

717
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 He provides a means of salvation.

718
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 What Moses does is he erects this staff with a snake on it.

719
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And what God says is that if you look,

720
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 if you look at the staff, you will live.

721
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 It's look and live.

722
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 Look and live.

723
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 So God in His kindness, He makes provision for the venom

724
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 that people are experiencing.

725
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 That is our story.

726
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Every single one of us has been bitten with the venom of sin.

727
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 The venom of sin courses through our veins.

728
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 And God has provided Jesus as the means for new life.

729
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 And His Spirit is the one who accomplishes that new life.

730
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Our responsibility is to look and live.

731
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 What does it mean to look to Jesus?

732
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 It's to come to a place.

733
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 A biblical faith is coming to a place where you are desperate for Jesus

734
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 to save you through His death, burial, and resurrection.

735
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 It's like this.

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Several years ago, I went skydiving.

737
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 And we were doing it as skit characters for this deal here at Watermark.

738
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 And I was skydiving with David Penuel, a guy on staff.

739
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 And we were dressed up as characters.

740
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 We were wearing mullets, and we had taped on Fu Manchu's.

741
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 And I am about to jump out of the plane.

742
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 And right before I jump, David Penuel asks the instructors,

743
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 "Hey, have you ever had to use the emergency parachute?"

744
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 And the guy was like, "Yes."

745
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 And I was like, "Oh, geez. Oh, man. I can't do this."

746
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Here's the reality.

747
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 The parachute of your good works has failed.

748
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 The parachute of you trying to earn your way into heaven has failed.

749
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 The parachute of you just being a good person has failed.

750
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 And some of y'all are free-falling right now, and you think it's enjoyable.

751
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 You just need to know that at the same time you're enjoying the free-fall,

752
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 that free-fall is leading.

753
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 It is a crash course toward death.

754
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 So every single one of us desperately needs Jesus.

755
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 To know Jesus is to know him as the only one who can save you.

756
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And without him, you are without hope.

757
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 A biblical faith is a faith that says, "Jesus, I want to live.

758
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 And without you, I can't. And without you, I won't."

759
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 And so here's what I want to do.

760
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 I just want to end by talking to four different groups of people in this room.

761
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Number one, some of y'all are here tonight, and for the first time,

762
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 a miracle is taking place in your life, and for the first time,

763
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 you've realized that religion will not cut it.

764
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 And you came in here, and the DTR has been clear

765
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 that you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,

766
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 and you want to begin a relationship with him.

767
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 The right response is to look to Jesus and live.

768
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 It is to receive him as a free gift tonight.

769
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Some of you here came into this place,

770
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 and you thought that you were a Christian,

771
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 and tonight you realize that you are an unsaved Christian.

772
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Because the reality is that you were looking to what you've done

773
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 or how good you are to make you right with God.

774
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 If that's you, if you've realized that you are an unsaved Christian,

775
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 it's the same response. Receive Jesus. Look to Jesus and live.

776
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 Some of you here came tonight,

777
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 and when you think about that on a scale of one to ten,

778
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 how sure are you if you were to die, you'd go to heaven?

779
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 You always say nine because it just feels too prideful to say ten,

780
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 and something's just a little bit nervous in you.

781
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 And yet your faith is genuine.

782
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 You've known that Jesus is your only way to a right relationship with God.

783
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 If that's you, my hope is that you can just rest,

784
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 and you can experience the joy of knowing

785
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 that God has done a miracle in your life.

786
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 Enjoy it. Be thankful for it.

787
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 And walk in confidence of where your relationship is.

788
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And then some of you are here, and you walked in,

789
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 and you're like, "I'm a ten out of ten,"

790
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 and your faith has been strong for a long time.

791
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Well, let me just ask you, when is the last time

792
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 that you just said thank you for the miracle

793
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 that God has accomplished in your life,

794
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 even just sitting down front during worship?

795
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 I was just thinking, "God, have I really embraced this talk?"

796
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 And so I just sat there, and I was like,

797
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 "God, thank you that I couldn't earn it.

798
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Thank you for the miracle that you have done in my life.

799
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 And Jesus, I am desperate without you."

800
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 Let's pray together.

801
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Lord, I pray that you would just have your way

802
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 in this room tonight,

803
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 that every person here would respond in some way, God.

804
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 And so for the people in the room

805
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 that want to put their trust in Jesus right now,

806
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 then here's what I want to encourage you to do.

807
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 Just in the quietness of your own heart,

808
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 you can just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?"

809
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Just say, "Jesus, I receive you.

810
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 I receive all of you tonight."

811
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 Just say, "Jesus, thank you that you died on the cross for me.

812
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

813
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 Would you come into my life?

814
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Would you forgive me of my sins?

815
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 And would you begin to lead me in a new life?"

816
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 And then for everyone else in the room,

817
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 would you just respond?

818
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Respond with gratitude.

819
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 Praise God for the miracle he's done in your life.

820
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
 Praise God for your salvation.

821
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 We're going to respond with worship.

822
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 There's going to be people down front.

823
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 If you need to talk to someone, pray with someone, get more clarity,

824
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 there will be a team down front.

825
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 If after we finish, you would benefit from just some extended worship,

826
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 you can go up to the chapel and do that.

827
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 If you want to take your next step with the church,

828
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 whether it's through membership or finding a place to plug in, community,

829
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 you can go over to the loft, go to our Next Steps.

830
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 If you don't have a Bible, you can go out to the welcome desk.

831
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 We'd love to give you a copy of the Word of God.

832
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 But this is a time for everyone to feel the freedom to just respond.

833
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 My hope is that you'd have clarity in this moment,

834
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 and that clarity would lead to confidence.

835
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 [music]

836
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,580
 (gentle music)
