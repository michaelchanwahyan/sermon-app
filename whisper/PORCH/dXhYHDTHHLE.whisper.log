[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:20.460]   - Man, I love it.
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.600]   That's amazing.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.600]   That's the coolest Jonah thing I've ever seen.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.520]   Hey, welcome friends.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.440]   We are kicking off a new series tonight on Jonah
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.760]   and it is gonna be a fun next few weeks.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.520]   Welcome friends in the room and in Fort Worth
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.040]   and in Houston, El Paso, and Tulsa,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.260]   Cedar Rapids, Woodlands, Spring,
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.420]   wherever you are tuning in with us from.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.260]   Hey, let me start with a story
[00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.600]   that'll give us some direction for where we're going.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.760]   Any dog people in the room?
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.500]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.400]   Wow, they are here.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.980]   Any cat people?
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   Okay, you guys.
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.440]   You're dismissed, all the cat people.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.240]   No.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.840]   Hey, let me tell you the worst part about,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.340]   if you're a dog owner in the room right now,
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.800]   you'll be able to relate to this.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.300]   The worst part about owning a dog, I'm a dog owner,
[00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.580]   we have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's like 130 pounds.
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940]   He's like a little baby elephant jumping around.
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.000]   And the worst part about having a dog
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.040]   is in the winter when it gets cold or rainy,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.200]   like it was for like six weeks straight here recently,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.320]   or icy or snowy.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.160]   And what do you have to do?
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.680]   You have to exercise the dog.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440]   And you get home from a long day of work
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.720]   and they've been taking a long nap for 12 hours,
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.040]   and they want you to take them out and exercise them,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.360]   and you're like, it's pouring rain.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.180]   This is terrible, my life is miserable.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.320]   Or it's icy cold outside and you gotta take 'em out
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.720]   and you gotta bundle up and you gotta put on
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.520]   all kinds of clothes and you gotta take 'em on a walk
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   or a run, I don't know if you're like me,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.640]   I'm not a runner, so it's like,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.440]   I'm already starting at a deficit.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.280]   And it's just my least favorite part,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.160]   particularly whenever it gets icy.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.320]   There was a time a couple years ago when it was icy,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840]   and I was living in the M Streets at the time
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.460]   on a duplex on Martell, and I had this dog.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.000]   I had just gotten him, he was a puppy.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.040]   And I would, it was like during kind of the ice apocalypse
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.800]   stage of Dallas where there was ice and snow and all that,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.960]   and I had to exercise him.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.840]   So what I would do is every night,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.640]   I would go down to Glencoe Park,
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.440]   which is right there in the M Streets if you're in Dallas,
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.160]   near Greenville and Mockingbird area.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.500]   And I would go and I would just bring a ball
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.100]   and I'd throw it, and I would wear essentially a big coat
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.040]   and like I'd go right before bedtime.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.600]   So I'm like in PJs and throwing the ball,
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.760]   trying to get the energy out of him,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.780]   throw him back in the car, he can ride shotgun,
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.540]   go back to the house, go down to bed.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.560]   One day I was on my way back from the park at night,
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.320]   and it was cold, it was icy, it was miserable outside.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.000]   I'm like bundling up in ski gear and slippers
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.080]   and mixing those two together.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.600]   And I see this as I'm driving just back to my house,
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.920]   which is really close, I see this stray dog
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.560]   that I can tell there's no one else around.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.220]   It's just a dog kind of wandering from one yard to the next
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.820]   and because, for whatever reason,
[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.300]   I don't know if you're the type of person that's like,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.100]   hey, I feel like I need to stop and check
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.340]   to see if this dog has tags,
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.980]   or a Christian is another way of saying that.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.540]   For whatever reason, I'm like,
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.920]   I feel like I have to like check to see if he has tags.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.620]   If he doesn't, I feel like I did my thing.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.500]   But if he does, then I should call the owner.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.780]   So I'm looking, I'm trying to see the tags,
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.320]   I'm pulling him next to him, he continues to go.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.060]   He sees me and he doesn't want anything to do with it.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.100]   He goes from one house to the next.
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.500]   So eventually, I kind of pull up in front of him
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.180]   and I pull into the driveway of the yard that he's in.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.420]   It's just a short driveway and I pull my car up there
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.320]   and I begin to open up the door
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.280]   to go see and check if he has tags.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.940]   As I'm opening up the door, the dog,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.060]   my dog that was sitting shotgun,
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.660]   takes this opportunity to make a break for it
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.380]   and goes right behind me and sprints off after the dog.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.900]   Now the stray dog takes off down the street
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.660]   and now both of them are on a direction.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.060]   I leave my car running, mind you,
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.220]   and begin to take off after them in slippers
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.020]   going Judah is the name of my dog.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.420]   Judah, Judah, come back, come back.
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.860]   That's not working at all.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.740]   And he's now chasing this other dog.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.420]   They go, they're running towards 75 on Martell,
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.380]   which is just a street.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.580]   But they're running towards 75,
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.980]   they go right down another street, they go back,
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.940]   and now they're running together towards Greenville.
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.020]   And I'm chasing after them in slippers,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.660]   just sprinting through the ice,
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.600]   yelling to get my dog to stop.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.400]   And I'm seeing my dogs get closer,
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.580]   my dog and this other dog,
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.980]   get closer and closer to Greenville,
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.820]   and I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.940]   in trying to save this runaway,
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.660]   I'm gonna end up losing both of them
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.860]   or they're both gonna get hit
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.660]   'cause Greenville's not exactly like a,
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.340]   you know, quiet neighborhood street.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340]   And so they're headed towards Greenville right by Gloria's
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.780]   and all of a sudden,
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.460]   I mean, and they're getting farther and farther
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.420]   'cause like I said, I'm not really a runner.
[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.540]   So the distance is not, I'm not closing in.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.620]   It's like, I'm just gonna power walk.
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.620]   I'm cramping.
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.120]   And out of nowhere, right before they're getting there,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.600]   this guy who's walking up and down Greenville with his dog
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.520]   turns the corner,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.340]   and the two dogs, my dog and this other dog,
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.800]   stop to, you know, do the dog greeting, if you will.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.880]   And I'm yelling to the guy,
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.600]   grab those dogs, grab those dogs, grab,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.720]   out of breath, he grabs the dogs,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   finally get over there.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.360]   I take both of the dogs,
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.800]   and I'm like, oh my gosh, man,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   this is the last time I'm ever gonna be a good Samaritan
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.040]   as it relates to dogs that I see.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.480]   And I begin to walk them back,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.900]   and I am now taking them,
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.940]   and the dog, the stray dog breaks loose again.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.220]   And I just grab onto my dog's leash,
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.260]   and he run, the other stray runs off,
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.420]   and I'm like, dude, you're on your own, buddy.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.620]   I've done all I can here.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.160]   You win some, you lose some, and he takes off.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.700]   And it was like, truly, I was so out of breath,
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.660]   I threw up in the bushes right there next to Gloria's.
[00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.260]   But I'm pretty sure that's not the first time
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.820]   that's happened, actually at Greenville.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   And so I am now walking back home,
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.080]   back to my car that's been running
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.720]   in this person's driveway,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.240]   and I get into the car, and I finally get home,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.200]   and I'm just like, oh my gosh, I'm exhausted.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.580]   That was miserable.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.520]   And I learned that night my limit
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.120]   as it relates to how far I will go to chase the runaway.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.240]   Tonight, as we look at chapter one of Jonah,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.240]   we are going to discover how far God is willing to go
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.000]   to chase the runaway, just like I learned my limit there.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.680]   Tonight, in chapter one, and really throughout
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.080]   the next few weeks, we're gonna see what is God's limit
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   as it relates to chasing people, not dogs, who run from him.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.960]   Inside of the room right now, lots of us,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   are either coming in, and we're in a season
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.400]   where we've been running from God,
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.120]   and we'll talk about exactly what that means
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.560]   and what that looks like, or we've had a season
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.680]   in our past where we were all runners, essentially.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.600]   And so it relates to the question of what is the limit
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.840]   that God's gonna go to, what is the limit
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.560]   that he's gonna allow you to run to,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.880]   or how does God interact with the runaways?
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.080]   How does God see them?
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.240]   Does God care about them?
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.320]   What's his relationship with people who run from him?
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.840]   Like, is he willing to go to any length?
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.440]   Maybe you came in the room tonight, and you're like,
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.360]   man, if you're a Christian, he'll go to any length.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.080]   Neither death nor anything else in creation can stop.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.440]   And do you really believe that?
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.880]   Like, if you did everything wrong,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.200]   if you just decided, hey, I'm an atheist,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.840]   I'm outta here, I don't care about God,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.920]   you're still thinking, man, there's no link.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.120]   He'll never stop coming after me.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.200]   Maybe you're inside of the room, and you're like,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.440]   no, that's not exactly, I mean,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.840]   God helps those who help themselves.
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.280]   You gotta kinda meet him halfway.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.920]   If you move in God's direction, he'll move in yours,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.760]   but it's not just a, hey, he'll never stop
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.480]   chasing after runaways.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.800]   What is the relationship that God has?
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.880]   Furthermore, how does he care about the season?
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.840]   Are we getting, do we get punished for the seasons
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.720]   in our life where we're running from God?
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.560]   Like, does he punish us?
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.920]   Does he punish our future?
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.680]   Like, maybe today you feel like my singleness,
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.040]   my relationship status, my job, career status
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.840]   is being impacted by my past season
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.680]   where I was running from God.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.880]   Am I being punished right now?
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.760]   So what is God's relationship to the runaway?
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.160]   And what is the limit to the length
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.360]   that he'll go to bring them back?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.040]   Both of these we'll discover tonight in Jonah chapter one.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.240]   If you have a Bible, you can flip over to Jonah chapter one.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.560]   You should probably just flip open
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.600]   at the very beginning of your Bible
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.240]   to find the table of contents to find Jonah, or good luck.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.400]   And 'cause it's kind of buried in there
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.480]   in what's called the minor prophets.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.040]   Jonah was a prophet.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.080]   What is a prophet?
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   In the nation of Israel, or in the Old Testament,
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.280]   which is the story of the nation of Israel,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.480]   God would show up and he would say,
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.840]   hey, I'm gonna speak to the nation through a prophet.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.560]   He's gonna raise up somebody and he says,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.840]   hey, I'm gonna speak to you and through you to my people.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Jonah was one of those prophets
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.540]   that God showed up about 750 BC and said,
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:41.320]   hey, I'm gonna speak to the nation of Israel through you.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.160]   Inside of the first chapter, what we're gonna discover
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.920]   is specifically the answer to three questions.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.320]   What running from God looks like for us today?
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.120]   As we look at Jonah's example,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.320]   what running from God leads to every single time?
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.520]   And then how far will God go to bring us back to him?
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.880]   We'll start in chapter one, verse one.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.740]   As we kick off, Jonah.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:11.440]   The word of the Lord came to Jonah, son of Amittai.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.800]   And it said, go to the great city of Nineveh
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.280]   and preach against it
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.040]   because its wickedness has come up before me.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.920]   But Jonah ran away from the Lord and he headed for Tarshish.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.680]   He went down to Joppa where he found a ship
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.280]   bound for that port and after paying the fare,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.480]   he went aboard and he sailed for Tarshish
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.080]   to flee from the Lord.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.440]   Now, what did we just learn?
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.840]   So Jonah gets told by God, hey, I want you to go
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.480]   and I want you to preach to Nineveh
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.160]   and I want you to call out to that city
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.800]   and tell them about me and tell them to repent
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.920]   and turn from their evil ways.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.780]   Jonah says, I'm not sure I'm gonna do that.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.180]   He decides to get on a boat and head for Tarshish.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.920]   Now, what's significant about the relationship
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.320]   or where's Tarshish and where's Nineveh
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.180]   and where's this all happening?
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.800]   So here's a map that should show us a little bit.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.120]   So he's told by God, he's hanging around Joppa
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.280]   and he said, hey, I want you to go over to Nineveh,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.560]   which is in modern day Iraq.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.500]   And Jonah says, yeah, you're kind of breaking up right now.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.680]   I think I'm gonna go to Tarshish
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.140]   and he decides I'm gonna get on a boat
[00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.200]   that's headed for the coast of Spain.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.260]   He's like, running of the bulls sounds nice.
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.480]   Maybe I'll check that out.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.960]   Not exactly sure about this Nineveh thing.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.560]   Now, why would Jonah not want to go to Nineveh?
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.680]   'Cause maybe you've heard this story before.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.480]   A lot of us grew up in Sunday school and we're like,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.840]   dude, I mean, why would you not just obey God, Jonah?
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.080]   You should have just gone to Nineveh.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.800]   Here's why for Jonah, Nineveh was not just a,
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.640]   you know, ministry opportunity that God was leading him in.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.560]   Jonah knew it would cost him his life
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.640]   or he likely thought it would.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.800]   Like the Ninevites were not good people.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.080]   They were the, Nineveh was the capital of Assyria.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.800]   What's all this have to do or why is that significant?
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.260]   The Assyrian nation was one of,
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.840]   like historians would say if you study history,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.600]   they're one of the most barbaric people,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.260]   group to have ever existed.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.520]   Like they were experts in doing incredibly cruel things
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.840]   so that the word got out, you do not want to mess with Jonah.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.240]   They mastered or perfected the ability
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.680]   to skin people alive.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.860]   So when they would conquer a town,
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.880]   they would take the men outside,
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.240]   they would bury them up to their waist
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.520]   and then they would watch or they would skin them alive
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.500]   from their waist up and then they would cut off their tongue
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.520]   and they would watch them die
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.400]   and they'd have their families watch them and die.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.760]   Then they would take the women and children
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.660]   and if they didn't burn them alive, which often happened,
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.760]   they would rape them or make them their slaves.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.960]   I mean, they are truly, they are the great, great,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.400]   great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.280]   great grandparents of ISIS.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.240]   I mean, that's who these people are.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.120]   It's just outside of Iraq.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.960]   That's where Nineveh is.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.080]   It's outside of Mosul, Iraq today.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.600]   And so Jonah not going like, Jonah's going,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   dude, it's gonna cost me my life.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.440]   Are you serious?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.840]   I mean, most of us won't even share our faith with,
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.280]   we're afraid to share it with like our barista at Starbucks
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.520]   and Jonah's like, hey, skinning out live
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.720]   or being skinned alive, I don't think so.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.000]   And so he decides, man, I'm gonna pick up
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.840]   and I'm gonna go, that I'm not interested in that.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.880]   It wouldn't be dissimilar for God to show up to you
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.060]   and say, here's what I want you to do.
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.060]   I've got a mission.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.640]   I want you to get on a plane
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.120]   and I want you to go and I want you to pull together ISIS
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.560]   and the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.040]   I want you to get everybody together
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.000]   and I want you to hand out WWJD bracelets,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.100]   tell them Muhammad is not a true prophet, Allah is not real.
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.820]   Jesus is the only way and he will accept your forgiveness
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.760]   or he'll extend your forgiveness if you repent
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.640]   and accept him as your Lord and Savior
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.600]   and do an altar call.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.000]   What would you say to God?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.960]   Yeah, yeah, that sounds like a great idea.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.560]   I think I'm gonna check out Spain.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.360]   That's exactly what Jonah did.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.720]   He's going, this is gonna cost me my life.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.120]   He says, I'm officially a retired prophet.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.640]   I'm gonna hang 'em up, no longer for me.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.640]   I'm gonna start over in Tarshish.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.940]   Or Tarshish.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.480]   And (laughs) I don't really know how it's pronounced.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.520]   (congregation laughs)
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.720]   And I'm not sure anyone does, but I think it's Tarshish.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.360]   So Jonah takes off.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.160]   The first point I wanna see from his life
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.360]   where Jonah decides, hey, I'm gonna run.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.000]   The word of the Lord comes to him, he says,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.660]   I'm not going to do that, is what running looks like.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.840]   For Jonah, it's exactly what it looks like for us.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.040]   Running from the Lord.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.240]   What does running look like today?
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.600]   First point, if you take notes,
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.760]   what does running look like today?
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.780]   The answer, disobedience.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.520]   Like running is not some huge season
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.920]   and actions and years and years.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.280]   Anytime that you and I are disobedient to God's word,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.800]   that's all Jonah did.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.720]   He told no to God.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.480]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.320]   Anytime you and I are disobedient to God,
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.640]   we, like Jonah, have officially begun to run.
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.300]   We may turn back, we may not run for very long,
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.500]   but anytime you and I disobey the word of the Lord,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.780]   what does running from God look like?
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.500]   It's just disobedience.
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.520]   And here's the way that I think that we do this,
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.360]   in two ways.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.880]   We say no directly, or we say no, not now.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.140]   We delay obedience.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.760]   Delayed obedience is disobedience,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.900]   and it is still running from the Lord.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.080]   What do I mean by delayed obedience?
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.580]   I mean the type of mentality that says,
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.820]   hey, I'm eventually gonna stop partying,
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.340]   just not right now.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.580]   I'm not gonna do the kind of weekend warrior thing forever.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.820]   This is called your 20s.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.940]   This is what you do.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.460]   You are officially running from God.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.020]   The person who says, hey, yes, we're living together,
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.740]   but we're eventually gonna get married,
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.000]   and we're married in God's eyes,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.300]   and God understands you are running from God,
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.620]   and you're doing it in a relationship,
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.620]   and in a way that God says is not how he designed
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.740]   marriage, dating, romance to take place.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.080]   We live together, and we're not married.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.780]   Maybe you're in a season of life where you're like,
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.300]   hey, I'm eventually going,
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.560]   you delay obedience through saying,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.380]   I'm eventually going to get plugged into a church,
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.540]   just not right now.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.220]   I mean, I moved here last year.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.100]   I'm still kind of getting settled.
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.540]   This is a busy work season.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.780]   I would get more plugged into a church,
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.940]   but I just don't have time for it right now.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.780]   I think God understands, really.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.620]   You are running from God,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.580]   and you are disobedient to his command
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.300]   for every Christian out there to be plugged in
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.580]   and connected to a local church if you're a Christian.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.380]   You have officially begun to run in that area of your life.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.900]   It doesn't always look like saying not now.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.140]   Someday I will, but not now.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.980]   That's disobedience.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.600]   It also looks like just blatantly saying no.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.540]   Some of you are in the room.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.460]   You are running from God as it relates
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.900]   to the dating relationship that you're in right now,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.820]   and you are just saying,
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.980]   you know you're in a relationship
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.020]   that is not honoring to God.
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.540]   You're dating someone that is not a believer,
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.100]   or they're not really deeply chasing after Jesus,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.760]   and God would say, you should not be in that relationship.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.860]   And you're saying, no.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.960]   I'm afraid of being single.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.900]   I'm afraid of the consequences.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.660]   I'm just kind of enjoying this right now,
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.020]   and I can't hear you very well,
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.300]   and you are saying no to God,
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.580]   'cause the attitude is like, look, you know,
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.820]   it's easier to become a Christian than to become hot,
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.700]   and they're pretty hot,
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.580]   and so I'll kind of work with them on the whole faith thing,
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.920]   and maybe I could be a light, you know?
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.780]   Someone needs to tell them about Jesus,
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.820]   and so that could be me, this guy.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.020]   And you are running, and as we're gonna see in a second,
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.780]   it never leads to a good place.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.220]   And the best thing that all of us can do
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.580]   when we discover an area of our life
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.540]   where we are running from God is to turn back,
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.740]   to repent, do whatever we have to,
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.300]   and in order to turn back to Him,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.780]   because as we're gonna see in the next few verses,
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.700]   just like what Jonah discovered,
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.900]   we're gonna discover,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.840]   of any time that you and I run from God,
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.980]   we run towards pain, towards destruction inside of our life.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.160]   Now, here's where I think the biggest challenge
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.300]   for all of us in the room is it relates to running from God.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.400]   If you're running in an arena of like, you know, alcohol,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.440]   or of just anything inside of your life
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.800]   that's not in line with God's word,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.000]   that is not living or lives disobedient to what God says,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.640]   here's the challenge I think for all of us.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.820]   Unlike Jonah's situation where God comes to him and says,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.260]   hey, I want you to go here, and he says,
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.680]   yeah, no, not gonna do that,
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.220]   and he takes off running in the other direction,
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.780]   the way that you and I run from God
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.380]   is generally a lot more subtle.
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.080]   It's not that God shows up and tells us,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.020]   here's this unique message, and we say,
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.060]   you know what, God, I'm outta here, catch me if you can.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.660]   That's not how we run from God today.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.900]   Usually, running from God is a drift.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.060]   It's just one decision after the next, after the next,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.020]   one disobedient decision after the next, after the next,
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.380]   until one day we find ourself going,
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.900]   how did I get here?
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.220]   I'm an alcoholic.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.560]   How did I get here?
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.300]   I'm addicted to pornography.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.480]   I'm in a same-sex relationship.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.600]   How did I find myself here?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.060]   I'm so far in the world,
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.000]   I can't remember the last time I thought about God.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.480]   And I remember the season in my life of being raised,
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.360]   and it wasn't like this, and I just feel so far from him,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.800]   because it's one decision after the next where we drift.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.280]   It's like this, my family loves to go to the beach.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.500]   I don't know if you like the beach,
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.400]   but my wife and I would love to go to the beach.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.000]   And we were in Mexico a little over a year ago,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.960]   and we were hanging out there,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.440]   and we got to do snorkeling and hanging out in the water.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.960]   And you go out, and you know what happens
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.460]   any time you go out into the ocean and you're snorkeling?
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.600]   A lot of times, you have this experience
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.440]   where you kinda stop from looking at the fish
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.600]   or doing whatever, and you look up,
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.640]   and you're like, where am I right now?
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.760]   Where's our hotel?
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.200]   And you look down, and your hotel's like four hotels down.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.040]   And you're like, how did I get here?
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.640]   It was just a slow drift.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.200]   Or you may not even have realized,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.820]   or I didn't even realize how far I had drifted.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:26.320]   Some of you right now, if you were to be honest
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.320]   with yourself, you are drifting.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.720]   And you find yourself in times going, how did I get here?
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.280]   How did I wake up here?
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.420]   It was one decision after the next after the next.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.240]   It was one, hey, I'm just gonna go on a date with this guy.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.920]   I know he's not Mr. Right, but he's Mr. Right now.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.880]   And I'm tired of being at home alone.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.080]   And so it's just a couple dates.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.320]   I know we're not gonna get married.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.840]   And then all of a sudden, it goes to a few more dates.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.160]   And then I had too many glasses of wine,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.440]   so we crossed purity boundaries.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.720]   And we already crossed 'em once,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.480]   and so what's the big deal if we end up sleeping together?
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.540]   And then we're spending more time and more time,
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.060]   and all of a sudden, he's the only person
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.800]   I really spend time with.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.480]   And he's asked me to move in with him.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.880]   And in a really quick instance, we go from,
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.520]   he's not Mr. Right to, we're living together.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.560]   I mean, think about that.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.720]   A lot of times, maybe you're a believer,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.320]   and you're like, man, I really wanna be intentional in 2018.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.160]   I wanna grow in my faith.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.480]   I wanna spend time studying God's word every single day.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.880]   I mean, even the ways that we drift from knowing God's word,
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.720]   and we wake up and we're like,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.920]   I haven't read my Bible in like a year.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.880]   And I had all these goals, and it just happened.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   One decision, one drift at a time,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.720]   where, hey, I missed that quiet time that morning,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.320]   and I was gonna do it during lunch,
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.760]   and then I didn't have a chance to do it during lunch,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.640]   and then all of a sudden, it's just a slow drift.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.880]   Honestly, this is how people walk away from their faith.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.400]   Like, this is the way that people, in other words,
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.560]   people usually, generally, I've never heard this story,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.520]   that they just woke up one day, and they were like,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.440]   you know what, I don't think God's real.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.720]   In fact, I read this book, and I've decided,
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.000]   closing that chapter on my life, moving on.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.880]   It's just one disobedient step after the next.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.100]   They don't trust how God says to date.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.160]   They don't trust how God says to live.
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.540]   They don't surround themselves with God's people,
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.680]   and then they wake up one day, and they're going,
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.160]   I don't even know if I believe this.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.960]   Maybe all roads lead to God.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.360]   And it was one step at a time, and they,
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.800]   and maybe you, like Jonah, were running
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.640]   one decision at a time.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.520]   So Jonah's on the boat, and he boards it,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.160]   and he's headed in the opposite direction,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.980]   and then he discovers what all of us who run from God
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.840]   discover, which is when we run from God,
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.920]   we run towards destruction or towards pain.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.360]   And here's what happens next.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.720]   Jonah on the boat.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   Then the Lord sent a great wind on the sea.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.080]   In such a violent storm arose that the ship
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.040]   threatened to break up.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.640]   All the sailors were afraid, and each cried out
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.120]   to their own God, so they're all terrified.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.480]   You know what's bad whenever sailors,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.040]   who literally live on the water, they're like,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.400]   this is what we do, that's my bed, this is where we stay.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.720]   We live out here, and they're like,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.040]   I'm terrified right now.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.940]   So terrified that they each begin just crying out
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.780]   to different gods.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.060]   They're like, you take Buddha, you take Muhammad,
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.380]   you take Jesus, and maybe somebody will answer us
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.780]   out there to stop the storm.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.880]   And they're crying out in order that something
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.620]   would stop the ship from falling apart.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.860]   And they threw cargo, or the prophets,
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.820]   you know, this is their business,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.980]   and they're like, just throw it over.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.700]   It's either the prophets or us.
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.980]   Get rid of it.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.300]   Into the sea to lighten the ship.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.060]   But Jonah had gone below deck, where he laid down
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.700]   and he fell into a deep sleep.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.700]   Side note, when you run from God, it is exhausting.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.340]   And if you're a believer in the room, you know.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.920]   I mean, Jonah's exhausted into a deep sleep.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.680]   And if you're running, you know it is exhausting.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.860]   Here's why.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.100]   Then the captain went to him and he said,
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.580]   how can you sleep?
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.800]   Get up and call on your God.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.480]   Maybe he will take notice so that we will not perish.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.860]   Then the sailors said to each other,
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.740]   come, let us cast lots in order to find out
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.900]   who's responsible for this calamity.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.900]   So casting lots, essentially, is like rolling dice.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.780]   They're like, let's play Yahtzee or Farquharl
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.940]   and let's decide who is responsible
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.820]   for why we're in this storm going on right now,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.220]   which is not uncommon in that time.
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.580]   Then they cast lots and the lots fell on Jonah.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.820]   And I think it's at this moment,
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.800]   'cause of what we're about to read,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.240]   that Jonah realizes this is not just any storm.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.080]   This storm is here for a reason.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.620]   This storm is here because of me.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:40.060]   So they asked him, Jonah, tell us,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.320]   who is responsible for making all this trouble for us?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.060]   What kind of work do you do?
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.940]   Where do you come from?
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.580]   What is your country?
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.680]   From what people are you?
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.860]   And he answered, I am a Hebrew.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.180]   I worship the Lord, the God of heaven,
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.620]   who made the sea and the dry land.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.380]   This terrified them and they asked, what have you done?
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.060]   They knew he was running away from the Lord
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.140]   because he had already told them so.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.700]   The sea was getting rougher and rougher,
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.740]   so they asked him, what should we do
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.340]   to make the sea calm down for us?
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.260]   Pick me up and throw me into the sea, he replied.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:15.580]   I think Jonah's just going, it's over.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.860]   I'm gonna die.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.660]   I might as well die, he replied, and it will be calm.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.140]   I know that it is my fault
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.620]   that this great storm has come upon you.
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.940]   Instead, the men did their best to row back to land.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.660]   They didn't wanna kill Jonah,
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.580]   but they could not for the sea grew even wilder than before.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.820]   Then they cried out to the Lord,
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.980]   Lord, please do not let us die for taking this man's life
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.140]   and do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man,
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.900]   for you, O Lord, have done as you have pleased.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.540]   Then they took Jonah and they threw him overboard.
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:49.620]   What does running from God lead to?
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.720]   Running from God always leads to discipline from God.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.300]   It leads to destruction regardless.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.460]   If you're a believer, it leads to discipline of the Lord.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.660]   If you're not a believer, it leads to destruction.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.500]   Anytime that we run from God's way,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.780]   from what God's word says,
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.260]   it just always leads to destruction inside of our life,
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.220]   to pain inside of our life.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.460]   If you're a believer, oftentimes it leads to pain
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.960]   as a form of God's discipline or care for you in your life,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.580]   like a good father disciplining a child.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.140]   Here's what Proverbs chapter three says.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.100]   Anytime that you disobey the Lord, discipline happens.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.660]   My son, chapter three, verse 11 and 12,
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.900]   do not despise the Lord's discipline.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.020]   Do not resent his rebuke,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.900]   because the Lord disciplines those he loves.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.140]   As a father, the son he delights in.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.980]   Just like a good father is gonna discipline children
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.860]   when they are disobedient to him,
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   the Bible tells us that God is a good father
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.660]   who will discipline his children.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.540]   That God will allow, when you and I disobey him,
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.900]   he'll allow us to experience storms in our life
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.900]   that are either the natural consequences of sin.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.220]   Sometimes he just lets you experience
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.060]   the consequence of sin.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.500]   Hey, you're gonna get an STD.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   That's what happens when you sleep or have sex
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.260]   in a way that's not in line with my design.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.460]   And sometimes he just allows us to experience
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.340]   the anxiety or the pain and things that happen
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.780]   whenever we run from God.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.340]   And they're all, just like with Jonah,
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.780]   the storm that God sends.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.620]   God sends a storm in as a form of discipline
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.660]   in Jonah's life.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.180]   The storm was God's mercy.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.340]   Hey, I'm not gonna let you make a Tarshish.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.580]   I'm not gonna let you abandon and walk away from your faith.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.220]   I'm not gonna let you leave this life of obscurity
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.780]   and walk away from me, Jonah.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.140]   I'm gonna intervene and I will not allow you to get there
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.460]   and I'm gonna send a storm.
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.220]   Some of you have experienced this,
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.540]   that God will send in storms or allow us to experience
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.540]   the pain of our decisions not to pay us back,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.580]   but to bring us back to him.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.180]   Like earlier, I was talking about my dog
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.060]   and the only way that I know how to control him
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.900]   is we have this thing called a shot caller.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.740]   He loves it.
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.740]   And it's really a form that anytime that he'll run off
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.820]   into the street or run away or put his life in danger,
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.100]   he'll get like a beep and then a shock
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.780]   if he doesn't respond and come back.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.660]   And very quickly, anytime he hears that beep,
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.780]   he is coming right back.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.540]   He's like electrocution, not a fan.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.620]   And so he runs right back.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.980]   Now when he disobeys and he runs into the street,
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.700]   do you think that I sit over there and I'm like,
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.700]   oh my, hey, payback time, buddy.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.540]   You didn't listen.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.660]   (imitates horn)
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.700]   No.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.100]   Only, the only pain that I introduce in that situation
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.420]   is all for the purpose of bringing him back to me,
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.540]   not paying him back.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.140]   Hey, you didn't listen, so here's your punishment.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.620]   It's to bring him back.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.840]   This is the way that the Bible says that God works,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.100]   that he will allow us to experience
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.380]   the consequences for sin.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.660]   This is just what sin brings.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.860]   And he'll allow you and I to experience that,
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.120]   not to be a form of payback,
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.460]   but to bring you back to him,
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.540]   to grab your attention into him.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.260]   He'll allow you to experience a breakup,
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.620]   job loss, anxiety, depression.
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.160]   If you run from God, you're gonna experience depression.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.180]   And he will allow it in hopes that it will grab
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.180]   your attention and turn you back to him.
[00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.180]   Like I said, an STD, a pregnancy test,
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.740]   or a pregnancy scare, or getting pregnant,
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.520]   all of the form of God saying, hey,
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.460]   I'm gonna let you get, I'll let you get a DUI
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.900]   if it's gonna grab your attention.
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.740]   I'll let you get fired from your job for stealing
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.700]   so that you don't go further and further down that path.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.540]   Just like with my dog, where I don't want him
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.000]   to go further and further into the street,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.660]   God is saying, I will let this,
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.040]   I will allow this to happen so you don't run further.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.260]   And he allowed it to happen with Jonah
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.540]   so that Jonah wouldn't run further.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.540]   There's a girl on our staff who really experienced
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.500]   the pain of running from God firsthand.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.860]   She, about five years ago, was not on our staff.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.460]   She's one of the most gifted girls I truly know.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.420]   And it's just an incredible gift to our team,
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.740]   to our ministry, and is involved in so many
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.740]   different parts of our ministry.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.020]   But it wasn't always that way.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.580]   About five years ago, she was in a season
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   where she was running from God.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.740]   And she was living, she would say, the party life.
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.060]   And she was like, dude, I would've told you
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.100]   it was the good life.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.220]   I mean, I wouldn't have said, like, everything's wrong.
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.420]   I would've said, this is the party life.
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:12.140]   It's what you do, I'm young, and this is the good life.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.220]   And then she met this guy, and they started to date,
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.420]   and they started to hook up, and eventually,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.060]   they decided, hey, we're gonna live together.
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.300]   And they moved in together, and she said,
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.900]   I had everything I thought I wanted.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.220]   I had the guy, I had kind of the job, I had the life,
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.940]   and something was missing.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.100]   And that something, on the inside,
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.780]   just caused all kind of anxiety inside of me.
[00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.620]   Well, she said, I started to have panic attacks.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.140]   One of them ended me up in the hospital,
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.620]   where I was like, oh, man.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.780]   She said, I felt like I was going to die.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.460]   I was so scared that I told my boyfriend,
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.180]   we gotta go back to church, 'cause if I'm gonna die,
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.500]   I at least need to know where I'm going.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.700]   And they went to church, she heard the gospel,
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.580]   she trusted in Jesus, and she began to make changes.
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.820]   But that anxiety that she felt that caused her
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.520]   to turn back to God was essentially God saying,
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.460]   I will allow you to experience this,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.980]   'cause I wanna grab your attention.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.660]   I don't want you to run the rest of your life
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.700]   running from me.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.820]   And if you're the person who's gonna be in charge
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.380]   of your life, you are going to run towards destruction
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.900]   every single time, if it's not running in my direction.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.380]   And God used all of that anxiety to grab her attention
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.060]   and to turn her back to him.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.140]   That is what God does.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.900]   Every time that we run from God, which is just disobedience,
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.980]   we are running towards the discipline of God,
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.760]   if you're a believer, and towards the destruction of God,
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.600]   if you're not.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.860]   If everything's fine, let me just say this.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.100]   If everything's fine in your life right now,
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.580]   you're like, dude, I'm running from God?
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.700]   I ain't getting hit with no storm.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.560]   I'm on top of the world, things are fine.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.060]   You should be concerned, because the Bible that I read
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.140]   says that God disciplines every child that he loves.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.000]   So if you're not experiencing any of that right now,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.700]   you need to ask yourself, are you somebody else's kid?
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.460]   Because you might not have a heavenly father,
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.900]   because the Bible that I have, and if you have a Bible,
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.380]   it's the one you have, says that God disciplines
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.300]   every single child that is his.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.080]   So if you're running, and everything's fine,
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.820]   his discipline is either coming, or you're not his kid.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.260]   And you need to trust in Jesus,
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.340]   who ultimately provided the payback,
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.100]   or ultimately was the atoning work,
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.020]   the means by which God said, I'm gonna pay for every sin
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.620]   inside of your life, and inside of my life.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:28.620]   God will allow pain in our life as a form of his mercy
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.440]   to get our attention.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.420]   C.S. Lewis, who's just a famous writer
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:35.260]   from the 19th century, or 20th century, said this.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.460]   God whispers to us in our pleasure,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.980]   he speaks in our conscience, but he shouts in our pain.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.660]   It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.860]   And Jonah experienced, we all experience
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:52.660]   when we run from God, that God will allow us
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.860]   to experience pain, not as payback,
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.480]   but to bring us back to him.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   And when you run from God, you run towards God's discipline.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.020]   Here's how the story ends.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.780]   Then they took Jonah, so the sailors are like,
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.140]   man, we don't wanna do this,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   but he's telling us it's the only way,
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.420]   and so I guess we should, God, please forgive us,
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.700]   as we read in verse 14, and then it says this.
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.780]   Then they took Jonah, and they threw him overboard,
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.580]   and the raging sea grew calm.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.980]   It's like everything stops.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.160]   At this, the men greatly feared the Lord.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.160]   That word there is Yahweh.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.060]   They're about to have a conversion experience.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.980]   And they offered a sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:33.700]   Yahweh's just essentially a more formal expression
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.200]   for the way we talk about God.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.260]   And they made vows to him,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.580]   that what just happened to the sailors,
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.260]   they threw him in the water, everything stops,
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.500]   and they're like, he was right.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.660]   His God is the one true God.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.420]   They left their pagan gods and those gods
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   that they were calling out, and it says,
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.740]   man, they worshiped Yahweh.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.540]   They worshiped the one true God who was there.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.680]   They made a sacrifice to him.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.860]   They made vows to him,
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.540]   that they all of a sudden become converts.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.220]   They stopped running from God.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.100]   Jonah's not the only runner in the story.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.620]   They had a moment where they turned back from God.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.260]   Despite having spent their entire life sailing
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.060]   and doing, we don't even know,
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.180]   but we do know that in this moment,
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.180]   they decided all those other gods are not real.
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.260]   This is the one true God, and they begin to worship him.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.500]   Now, the Lord provided, verse 17,
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.540]   a huge fish to swallow Jonah.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.040]   And Jonah was in the belly of the fish
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.100]   for three days and three nights.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.140]   That's where we'll pick it up next week.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.900]   But the verse just said that the Lord provided
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.860]   or the Lord appointed.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.420]   Here's what's crazy, is it's like,
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.420]   the same word that is used for provided
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.800]   is also used for appointed or destined.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.120]   It's as though God fashioned this huge fish early on
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.800]   and said, "Hey, buddy, I'm gonna have you swimming
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.360]   "around in the Mediterranean Sea for a while,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.480]   "and eventually I'm gonna, here we go,
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.540]   "and you're gonna go get him."
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.540]   And all of a sudden, the waters are calm.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   Jonah's just hanging there.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.700]   The guys in the boat are like, "Man, it's really calm.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.540]   "There's Jonah."
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.920]   And a fish just comes up, swallows him,
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.760]   takes him to Nineveh.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.300]   Now, what I wanna point out,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.520]   and what I was so ministered to about this week
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.400]   is just the fact of our third question.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.700]   How far will God go to bring back the runaway?
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.880]   To whatever length it takes.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   How far will God go back?
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.980]   I mean, think about how crazy this story is
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.920]   as it relates to the Ninevites who were running from God.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.040]   Ninevites, as a culture, are like,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.540]   "Hey, we're horrible people.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.680]   "We are gonna run from God.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.680]   "We're gonna kill people.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   "We're gonna enslave people, cut off heads,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.880]   "skin people alive."
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.840]   That's who the Ninevites was.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.160]   God loved the Ninevites so much
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.500]   that he was willing to say, "Jonah,
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.920]   "hey, you're going to Nineveh.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.700]   "You're gonna go tell them about me.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.560]   "You're gonna go tell them about my mercy
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.640]   "we learned in chapter four.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.140]   "You're gonna go tell them about the God who was there
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.120]   "because God was crazy about the Ninevites."
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.400]   God loves bad people.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.240]   If you're in the room and you're like,
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.560]   "Man, could God ever love me?"
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.400]   Let me tell you, my Bible teaches that God loves bad people.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.280]   Bad people like me, bad people like you.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.400]   Bad people who don't even think they're bad people.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.680]   And he was willing to do whatever it takes,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.780]   "Jonah, you're gonna go to the Ninevites.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.720]   "So I'm gonna send a fish that's gonna swallow you up
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.460]   "and it's gonna carry you over to the Ninevites
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.760]   "and spit you up on land."
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.120]   It's the very first Uber.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.560]   God says, "It's gonna be a fish.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.860]   "I'm gonna send it, it's gonna catch you
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.800]   "and it's gonna take you over there
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.680]   "where you want it to or not."
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.800]   Because God loved the Ninevites.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.960]   How far will God go to bring back people
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.760]   who fillet others alive?
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.840]   As far as it takes.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.640]   How far would God go to bring back Jonah?
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.480]   As far as it takes.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.160]   I'll send a storm, I'll send a fish.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.240]   I'm gonna do whatever it takes.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.600]   You will not live a life of obscurity away from me, Jonah.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.800]   Because I will go to whatever length it takes.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.440]   God will go to whatever length it took
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.300]   to bring back the sailors.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.140]   I mean, think about it.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.080]   Of all the boats that Jonah could've got on,
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.200]   of all the places that he could've run to,
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.160]   he just happens to get on this one boat
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.700]   inside of the Mediterranean Sea
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.840]   that's headed for Tarshish with these sailors
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.600]   and he could've got on any number of different ways.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.640]   He could've taken a camel, he could've done anything.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.680]   He gets on a boat, all of a sudden these sailors
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.320]   go from pagans who worship these false gods
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.220]   to the worshipers of the one true God who is there.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:58.220]   Because God will go to any length to bring back runners.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.920]   Does God ever stop running after people running from him?
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.980]   No, and he will do whatever it takes.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.760]   How do I further even know that?
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.180]   Because 750 years from this moment, 750 BC,
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.000]   750 years, God would send his son in the form of Jesus
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.960]   to die on a cross to prove I will go to whatever it takes
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.860]   to bring you back to me.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.140]   Not as payback because all of the payment for your sin
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.020]   is gonna go on him.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.640]   And I'm gonna do that in order not to punish you,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.940]   but to bring you back to me.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.380]   I'll go to whatever length it takes,
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.500]   including giving the life of my son.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:35.620]   I wouldn't give my son's orange juice to you.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:37.540]   God says I will give the life of my son's
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.420]   how crazy in love I am with you.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.660]   And if you're in the room, and here's what I know
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.540]   is in the room, the message that I'm even talking about,
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.680]   it just sounds crazy to you.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.220]   It sounds like, man, it's fluffy words and that's nice.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.720]   Could God really love me?
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.500]   You don't know what I've done, David.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.460]   I'm a gay, I'm in a gay relationship right now.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.100]   I'm in a lesbian relationship right now.
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.500]   I've slept with a married man.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.060]   I'm addicted to heroin, I'm addicted to pain pills,
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.420]   I'm addicted to all kinds of whatever drug,
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.060]   substance can numb me from this life around me.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.180]   Could God really love me?
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.020]   I've had an abortion.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.500]   I encouraged my girlfriend to have an abortion.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.780]   I'm a murderer.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.580]   God could really love me?
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.420]   Yes.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.140]   And he's gone to the greatest length that he possibly could
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.180]   and he will go to any length to show that to you.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.520]   And if you're running from him,
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.120]   there is nothing that he will do
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.480]   or there's nothing that you could do
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.820]   that could make him stop chasing and pursuing after you.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:36.940]   If you're coming in, you're like, dude,
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.560]   I just can't even relate to these people
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.440]   and this Christian faith,
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.640]   it's all these people who have it together.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.080]   Have you ever read the Bible?
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.920]   I mean, think about the people
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.000]   that are the heroes in our faith.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.720]   Paul, the apostle Paul wrote half the New Testament,
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.060]   murdered Christians.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:50.440]   I don't know what your story is.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.160]   My guess is you didn't murder Christians.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.560]   What did God do with Paul?
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.220]   Hey, Paul, you're gonna write half the Bible,
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.260]   half the New Testament.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:59.740]   That's what you're gonna do.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.300]   David, remember I heard of David,
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.860]   killed Goliath, man after God's own heart.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.020]   David slept with his best friend's wife
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.740]   and then had him killed to cover it up.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.620]   My guess is that's not your story.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.540]   If it is,
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.780]   well, we'll work through it.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.940]   There are consequences.
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:22.700]   But even if it is, let me be clear.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.460]   David, the one that God says the Messiah
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.480]   will forever be on the throne of David,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.080]   he's a murderer and an adulterer.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.240]   I don't know what your story is,
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.140]   but if you read the Bible,
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.560]   it's not filled with these pages of like,
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.080]   oh man, these people have it all together.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.700]   I could never be someone who could relate to their story.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.360]   Whatever you've done, whatever your story is,
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.880]   if you will just turn to him,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.640]   there is no length that you have run
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.880]   that has outrun the love and the grace of God.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.780]   And if you run, you will run towards destruction.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.140]   Every step that you take,
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.460]   but if you turn and you will turn back to him,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.900]   you are stepping towards God's grace, mercy,
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.560]   and the story that he can write.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.260]   There is no limit to the ways that he can use you,
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.520]   no matter your past.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.420]   There's no limit to the forgiveness that he can offer you,
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.940]   no matter the things that you have done
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.540]   or that I have done.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.440]   Jesus ultimately is who this story points to.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.360]   Jesus even said that.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.640]   He said, hey, you guys are not gonna get any sign
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.480]   but the sign of Jonah.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.600]   We'll talk about that in a couple weeks.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.920]   But Jesus ultimately said, hey, Jonah was pointing towards me
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:35.120]   but in a superior way.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.080]   Jesus was so much better than Jonah.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.680]   He was everything Jonah was not.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.600]   But Jonah ran from his enemies, the Assyrians.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.100]   Jesus ran towards them.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.040]   Jesus or Jonah was all about self-protection.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.520]   Jesus poured himself out in sacrifice.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.660]   Jonah was like, hey, I'm about me.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.240]   Jesus was like, I'm about you.
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.840]   Jonah was a sinner who ran from God.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.640]   Jesus was the God who ran towards sinners.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.200]   Jonah needed a savior and Jesus was Jonah's savior.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.040]   And if you ever come to trust in Jesus,
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.440]   he'll be your savior.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.640]   He's the only savior.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.800]   He's the savior of the world
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.940]   and there's no length that he will stop.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.040]   How far will God go to bring runaways back
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.680]   or to run after runaways?
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.980]   As far as it takes, even the life of his own son.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.680]   When we run from God, we do it through just disobedience.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.080]   When we run from God, if we're his child,
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.760]   we experience discipline and there is no length
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.400]   or no limit to the length that God will go
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.320]   in order to not pay us back.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.520]   All of the payment already went on Jesus
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.920]   but to bring us back to him.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.320]   I have a two-year-old son and I'll close here.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:55.000]   He's gotten to that stage where he can count
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.280]   up to a certain number and so that allows us
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.880]   to play hide and seek and so we'll play hide and seek.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.840]   And it's so funny, when he is hiding and I'm seeking,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.920]   I'll count to 10, ready, nine, 10, ready or not,
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.240]   here I come and he can't stand it.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.160]   He's like, here I am, here I am!
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.920]   And he just doesn't totally get it.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.120]   And then I'll go hide.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.420]   And he'll have to come find me.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.500]   And he's not very good at it 'cause he's two.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.460]   And like I could be hiding behind this
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.920]   and he would be like just wandering around in circles.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.860]   And so I have to help him.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.080]   I have to just, I'll say, crew, crew!
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.140]   Or I'll try to make noise or I'll do something
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.640]   to grab his attention, to let him know where I am.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.820]   When I play the game, my goal is not to win.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.900]   It'd be silly if I was like, hey man,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.420]   I'm a little competitive, all right?
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.280]   You gotta find me, buddy, okay?
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.360]   No free lunches here, all right?
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.340]   My goal is for him to find me.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.520]   And whatever I gotta do to grab his attention,
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.720]   that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.280]   This is what the Bible says God is like.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.160]   That his goal is not to win, his goal is not to see you
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.320]   burn in hell forever, his goal is for you to find him.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.940]   And let me show you this.
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.320]   He wants to know you and wants you to know him
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.380]   more than you will ever want to know him.
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.880]   God is more concerned with you knowing him than you are,
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.920]   or you will ever be.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.540]   In all of your life, God is saying,
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.840]   I am throwing in flares to try to grab your attention,
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.240]   where just like a father saying, hey, here, here, here,
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.440]   he's trying to grab your attention.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.280]   How do I know?
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.240]   You're in the room right now.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.720]   You're in a church right now, wherever you're listening from.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.540]   You're listening to a sermon from a church.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.380]   Think about that.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.960]   And you're like, oh man, is that really God pursuing me?
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.440]   God's pursuing me 'cause I'm in the room
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.260]   in a church right now?
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.240]   I think I'm in the room because I came with him.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.120]   That was God's mean of bringing you here,
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.640]   or means of bringing you into this room tonight.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   That whatever your story is, let me promise you this,
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.780]   the God who is there is crazy in love with you.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.360]   And everything that you experience
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.080]   is something where he is trying to reach out to you.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.980]   In the midst of all the pain and all the brokenness,
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.480]   that he's trying to use anything he can
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.820]   to grab your attention.
[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.700]   Say, look at me, look at me.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:17.720]   And just like with Jonah, and just like with my son,
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.060]   apart from him intervening and saying,
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.460]   here I am, find me.
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.500]   We wouldn't see it, we wouldn't choose to see it.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.140]   But the good news is he has intervened.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.260]   He's intervening in your life.
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.520]   He intervened 2,000 years ago on a cross at Calvary.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.160]   So that you never have to wonder
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.500]   how far would God go to bring me back?
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.020]   Who's too far from the love of God?
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:37.860]   No one.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.940]   That's the message of Jesus.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.180]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.540]   That's the message of the Bible.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.740]   Let me pray.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.740]   Father, thank you for the story of Jonah,
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:50.020]   that it points to a Savior who will go at,
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:55.460]   will stop at no length to bring us back to him.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:02.440]   Thank you that you're a God who, unlike Jonah,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.740]   who ran from his enemies,
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.980]   you're a God who runs towards enemies like me.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.420]   Father, I pray for anyone in this room right now,
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.500]   and they are running.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.700]   They're making one decision after the next.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.540]   They've pushed you out of their life.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.420]   They're not even convinced that they need you.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.900]   They've spent years running from you.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.060]   They may have overwhelming shame and guilt
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.180]   from past decisions that you would press
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.420]   on their heart right now.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.920]   And you would allow them to experience
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.080]   in a way that I don't even know how to ask for.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.860]   Your love and your mercy and your forgiveness
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.500]   because they would trust not in how good of a person
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.680]   they are, but they would trust in Jesus,
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.120]   the Savior of the world, the Savior of Jonah,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.940]   the Savior of all who call on him,
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.740]   Savior that we worship now in song, amen.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:06.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
