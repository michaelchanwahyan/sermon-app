1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 As I went down in the river to pray, Studying about the good old way,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And who shall wear the starry crown, Good Lord, show me the way.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 O sinners, let's go down, Let's go down, don't you want to come down.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 O sinners, let's go down, Down in the river to pray.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Come on.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Man, it's good to have you here in the room or online tonight, Tuesday night.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 And it's special for me because this is my first time being here in Dallas

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 officially as a part of the porch team as the director of discipleship.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And I'm just so honored.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 You know, my family and I about a month ago made the trek from Houston, Texas

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 to the promised land, Dallas, Texas.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 More people whooped for Houston than Dallas.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Okay.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Hey, here's a picture of my family.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 My name's Tyler, by the way.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Here's my family that's coming, I believe, here in a minute.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Oh, there they are.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And that's my wife, Jen, and then my daughter, Emery K.,

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 my son, Ty, who's holding the coconut or whatever that is,

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 and then Malachi.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We call him the Malachi Kalachi.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And, man, we're just so glad to be a part of this family.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And thank you for welcoming us in.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Thank you for those of you who are here, and thank you for those who are

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 tuning in all across the country and the Porch Live locations.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Man, we're just so glad that you're here.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Hey, one thing I want to say that I've just been -- as I've been thinking about

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 tonight, you know, sometimes I remember sitting in the seat that you're sitting

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 in, and sometimes I would wonder, hey, that guy that's up on the stage,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 is he the real deal?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Is he just playing some game, kind of manipulating people,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 and you make your judgment about me.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 But I just want to say something about the man who's typically up here,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 my friend for years, Kylan.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And I've known Kylan beyond stages.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I've seen him at high highs, and I've seen him at low lows.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I just want to say to those of you who call the porch home that the man that

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 you think Kylan is is who he is.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 This man, I have watched him weep in prayer on his face on behalf of revival

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 across our country.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 On behalf of you, he may not know your name, but he's praying and begging God

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 to move in your heart.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 And I just want -- one of the reasons why I'm here is to be an adrenaline shot

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 for his ministry, to go, God is working in Kylan Perry's life,

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 and it's just an honor to come alongside him.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So can we just thank this to show honor to Kylan.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Man, thank you.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 [Applause]

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Hey, if you have a Bible, go ahead and open up your Bible to 1 Kings.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I don't know when the last time you were in 1 Kings, but we're going there tonight.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 1 Kings Chapter 19.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 No big deal if you need to use your table of contents to get there.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 1 Kings Chapter 19.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And as you're turning there, I want to tell you one of the best pieces of advice

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 that I've ever received in my life.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And that piece of advice is that all frustration in your life is rooted

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 in unmet expectation.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I'm going to say that again.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 All frustration in your life is rooted in unmet expectation.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So I want to ask this tonight.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 As you look back on your life, has there been a season of frustration

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 that you remember living through, some of you are living through it now,

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 that you can look back and say that season was marked by unmet expectation?

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 You know, I've been thinking about my life this week, and I thought about

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 back when I was in college, and I was a finance major, okay?

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And I remember sitting -- yeah, finance bros in the room, come on, yeah.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 That's awesome.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Well, I remember being in class with you guys, okay?

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And y'all are geeking out about assets and liabilities and P/E ratios

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 and Patagonia sweaters, you know.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And all the while, I'm getting into it, but I really started to feel this

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 passion in my heart for ministry of all things.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And I'm reading the Bible, and I'm discipling guys in my fraternity,

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 and I'm going, "Oh, no.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 I think I may be called into this thing, like, for my life."

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 And so I ended up kind of on a whim applying for this year-long residency

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 at a church up here in Dallas called the Village Church.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And somehow they let me in.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And so that started in August.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So I graduated in May.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 That started in August, so I had the summer, and I went and found a

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 three-month internship with student ministry with middle schoolers.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And while I'm there, just snot-nosed, middle school, running all around,

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 while I'm there, the youth pastor actually leaves to go be a lead pastor

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 of a church, and that church offered me the job to be youth pastor.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So I'm conflicted.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 I'm like, "Do I take this full-time job, or do I go and be a resident

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 for a year at the Village?"

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And I remember one Tuesday night praying, "Oh, God, make it clear.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Like, what am I supposed to do?"

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Then Wednesday rolls around, and there's a middle school event.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And I'm at the middle school event, just hanging out, you know,

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 handing out pizza or whatever.

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And I get three wet willies in my ear from middle school kids.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 You know what wet willies are?

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You lick your finger and put it in your ear.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And after the third wet willie, I was like, "I am a finance major

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 at Texas A&M.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I should not be getting wet willies."

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Oh, my gosh.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Okay.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Some of you love that.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 The majority of you hate it, okay?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But after the third wet willie, I had made up my mind.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I'm not doing student ministry.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 That era is done.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I'm moving on to adults at the Village.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 This is going to be better.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 So I respectfully decline.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I move up to Dallas.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I start the residency.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And pretty early on, I realize, "Oh, I'm like the bottom of the food chain here.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I'm just doing all the behind-the-scenes work."

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But I finally got a meeting with one of the executive staff,

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 one of the big names, not Chandler, okay, but another one.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And I finally said it for months later.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And the meeting comes the day before.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I'm in Houston.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And it floods in Houston.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And I can't make it back to Dallas.

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 So I have to message this guy, "Hey, I'm so sorry.

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I can't make the meeting.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Can we postpone?"

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 He goes, "Okay."

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Sets it for a month later.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I wait a month.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 No joke.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I'm back in Dallas.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And a hailstorm hits the night before.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And the power goes out.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And I sleep through my alarm and miss the breakfast meeting.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And I call him.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I go, "I'm so sorry.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I'm on my way."

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 He goes, "Tyler, don't worry about it.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 We're not going to meet."

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And I find out later.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Okay, the Village Church is Matt Chandler.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 If you've heard of Chandler, I've looked up to Chandler my whole life.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 This guy goes and tells Chandler, "Tyler Moffat, that guy's a moron."

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 That's what he said.

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I found out later.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 I'm crushed, just like, "Ugh!"

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Last part of the story.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Three-fourths of the way through the residency, my boss sits me down.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 He says, "Hey, Tyler, as we've been kind of analyzing you and as we've been

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 really thinking about your gift set, we've determined that you would fit

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 better in student ministry."

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And I'm like, "Ugh!"

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 And I just remember going home.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I'm just being honest with 2,000 of my favorite friends.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I remember driving home.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I was frustrated.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I had all these expectations for ministry that I was going to be a part

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 of changing the world and jumping in on some big, massive revival,

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 teaching big crowds, and I'm stuck with middle schoolers.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And I remember as I was in that place, all the zeal that I had for ministry

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 just evaporated.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 I'm just being honest.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And I'm curious for you tonight, as we have this revival series,

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 if you've been tracking with us, we've been talking about this kind of

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 statistics are showing that there's this quiet revival that's going through

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 our country and more and more people are returning to God.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 They're returning to Christianity, specifically among young adults.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And it's exciting.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And you go, "Oh, this is amazing."

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And then some of us, like me, right out of college, you look at your life

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 and you go, "That's great, but that's not what I'm feeling in my life

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 right now."

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And tonight, what we're going to do is we're going to talk about

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 specifically zeal that persists, that lasts through the mountaintop

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 and the valley.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 How do you have a passion for God, a zeal for God that goes beyond

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 just the mountaintop, camp-high moments, but even in the low part,

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 you go, "I'm still red-hot in my passion for God."

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 How do you get that?

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 That's where we're going to look at.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Here's the definition of zeal as we're looking at it today.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Here's how we define it.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Zeal is an energetic pursuit and unwavering commitment to God.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 How do you get that?

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 That's where we're going to look at.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Let me pray, and then we're going to dig into 1 Kings 19.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 God, we just--we really, like the songs we just sang, we really want

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 to commune with you, the God of the highlands and the God

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 of the valleys.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 God, you are not hiding from us.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 You want to reveal yourself to us, and so, God, we are asking,

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 "Please come."

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Oh, God, we long for an encounter with you tonight, and maybe it's a big

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 fanfare moment of emotional excitement for you, or maybe, maybe it's the

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 still small whisper of knowing that you are real, you are good,

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and you see us and have a plan for our lives.

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Oh, Jesus, we just want you.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 We long for you, and it's in your name we pray.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Amen.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 All right, 1 Kings 19, a little background.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Elijah, this is the story of Elijah, and Elijah's the prophet in the midst

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 of a godless society, and yet, Elijah's greatest goal is to see Israel

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 revived.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Like, he wants what our series has been about.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He wants to see revival break out among his nation, and yet, there's a

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 problem.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 The king and the queen are evil, not just like a little evil, like the

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 worst evil that Israel has ever seen.

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It's Ahab, who you've maybe heard about, and he's married to his

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 beautiful wife, Jezebel, okay?

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 And Jezebel says, "Hey, the national religion in Israel is now

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Baal worship."

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And all the people just go, "Okay," and they go into Baal worship, and

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 they're all sacrificing against God.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And so, Elijah, the first thing he does is he prays that God would cause

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 a drought on the land.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And you go, "Why would he do that?"

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And the reason is because back in Deuteronomy chapter 28, it said,

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 "There are blessings for your obedience.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 There are curses for your disobedience."

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 One of the main ones is drought.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 If the Israelites were paying attention to their Torah, to the Bible, they

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 should know, uh-oh, drought equals God is punishing us.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We should return to him, and yet, they miss it.

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 So then, in chapter 18, Elijah goes nuclear.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Then he says, "All right, here's what we're doing.

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Your prophets versus Yahweh's prophet.

225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 450 prophets of Baal versus one prophet of Yahweh.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 We're having a showdown on Mount Carmel."

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And the whole town shows up, and the 450 prophets of Baal are dancing

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 around their idol, trying to get their God to send down fire.

229
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Nothing for hours.

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And Elijah's making fun of them.

231
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 He's like, "Oh, maybe your God's using the bathroom."

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 This is in the Bible.

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 He's like, "Maybe he's asleep.

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Maybe if you cheer louder, he'll wake up."

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Nothing.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And then Elijah says, "All right."

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He puts water on his altar.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He prays, and he says this in chapter 18, verse 36.

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 He says, "Oh, Lord, let it be known to you this day that you are God in Israel

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 and that I am your servant and that they have turned their heart back to you."

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 He says, "I, more than anything else, I will have a zeal for you,

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and I want to see the return."

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And fire comes down from heaven.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And after fire comes down, the 450 prophets of Baal are killed by the people.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And then this is what Elijah does.

246
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He runs to Jezreel where the king and the queen are.

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 He runs.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 He hightails it, and he says, "I want to watch this revival play out.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It's going to be amazing."

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Because either the king and the queen are going to see this and repent,

251
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 or the people are going to cause an uprising and kick them out.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 The status quo cannot stay the same.

253
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And yet look what happens in 1 Kings chapter 19, verse 1.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Look at this.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 So all that has just happened, 19, verse 1.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 "Ahab, the king, told Jezebel, the beautiful queen, all that Elijah had done

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.

258
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying, 'Revival is breaking out.'"

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 No.

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 "So may the gods do to me and more also,

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 if I do not make your life as the life of one of them,"

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 one of these prophets that you killed, "by this time tomorrow.'

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Then Elijah was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life

264
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah,

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 and he left his servant there," verse 4.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 "But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 and came and sat down under a broom tree."

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Look at this.

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 "And he asked that he might die, saying, 'It is enough.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers.'"

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Okay, what's going on here?

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Elijah, all his expectations, everything that he expected God to do are unmet,

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 and he's incredibly frustrated to the point where he says, "I'm done.

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I'm done being your prophet.

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I'm done trying to live some life for you.

276
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Kill me.

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 If you have any mercy, God, kill me because I'm just done.

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 It's enough.

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I'm no better than anybody else," and he's just ready to die.

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And I'm curious, have you been here?

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You know, I was just thinking, writing down some things.

282
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 You know, maybe some of you were expecting things to end in marriage,

283
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 and yet instead you got the text from that person that said,

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 "I hope we can still stay friends," right?

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And you're going, "What?"

286
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Like my whole expectation was this was going somewhere.

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Everything that they were communicating seemed like this was heading the right direction,

288
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 and then you're just going to say, "Let's just be friends.

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I don't want to be with you anymore."

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 What?

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Some of you moved halfway across the country to Dallas or wherever

292
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 to be a part of a job that you're passionate about and your calling is,

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 and you move here, and you're sitting in traffic on 635 in 110-degree heat going,

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "Really?

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 This is the rest of my life?

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 This is it?"

297
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 You know, some of you made it through that recovery program.

298
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 It was incredibly embarrassing, incredibly difficult, but you beat it

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 only to find yourself a few months later in the same crap that you just got yourself out of.

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So you thought.

301
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 This is very relatable.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Where Elijah is right now is where we often are in life.

303
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 So what does God do?

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 The rest of our time together, we're just going to see with our own eyes

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 what does God do to the one who is expecting great things and is incredibly frustrated.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And we're going to see God doesn't freak out, but he starts the work of restoring Elijah's zeal.

307
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 In fact, God does three things.

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 God does three things to restore Elijah's zeal, and the first one is this.

309
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 First one is we see that God cares for the body as well as the soul.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 God cares for the body as well as the soul.

311
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Let's look in 1 Kings 19, starting in verse 5.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So all this had just happened.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 He says, "God, kill me," verse 5, "and he, Elijah, lay down and slept under a broom tree.

314
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And behold, an angel touched him and said, 'Arise and eat.'

315
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water.

316
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And he ate and drank and lay down again.

317
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said, 'Arise and eat,

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 for the journey is too great for you.'

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights

320
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 to Horeb, the mount of God."

321
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So notice, the first thing that God does to Elijah, his prophet saying, "Just kill me,"

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 the first thing God does is nothing.

323
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 It's nothing.

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 There's no lecture.

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 There's no counseling.

326
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 There's no therapy.

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 All God does is send Dordash, angel version, okay?

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And literally the angel touches him.

329
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I mean, I'm just thinking of this scene, like Elijah's like, "Oh, kill me,"

330
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 and the angel pops up and is like, "Hey, buddy, you know, have a snack."

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Like, that's just what happens.

332
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I could use a snack."

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And there's this weird exchange.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Angel having a snack.

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 He's like, "Go to sleep, buddy.

336
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Here's a blanket," you know?

337
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And he sleeps under this tree, and we're reading this like, "Oh, yeah."

338
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And then it happens again.

339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 The same thing.

340
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He wakes up.

341
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 He's like, "Oh, where am I?

342
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Here, have a scone," you know?

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And here's what's so interesting.

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 This is why I love the Bible.

345
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's such a great book.

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 The Bible realizes how human beings are made.

347
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 God knows.

348
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 He's intricately -- He knows how you're wired, how you're made.

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And in the moment of frustration, you're at your wits' end,

350
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 you're at the suicidal point of depression.

351
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 God goes, "You know what?

352
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I'm not coming bringing you a lecture first.

353
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I'm coming bringing you a snack and some food and a nap."

354
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Elijah didn't need a sermon.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He needed sleep.

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And sometimes the most spiritual thing that we can do is take a nap.

357
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Hallelujah, somebody, right?

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Now, here's what's important.

359
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I'm not talking about self-care here, right?

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 We kind of live in that culture of like self-care, care about yourself,

361
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 and that's great, but that's not what I'm talking about.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Here's the reality.

363
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Some of you are blaming God.

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 You are angry at God for the circumstances in your life when the reality is the

365
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 way you have wired your schedule and your habits is burning you out.

366
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 And it's killing you.

367
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And God is saying, "Stop it.

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Slow down.

369
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Eat a snack.

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Go to bed.

371
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Stop doom scrolling on your phone for two hours and then waking up

372
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 and going, 'I don't have time to spend with you.'"

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And you're like, "Really?"

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Maybe your habits, your lack of sleep, the way that you're exercising or not,

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 all those things are feeding what's going on in you.

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Martin Lloyd-Jones, who was a medical doctor before he became a pastor,

377
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 said this.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 He said, "You cannot isolate the spiritual from the physical,

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 for we are body, mind, and spirit.

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 The greatest and best Christians, when they are physically weak,

381
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 are more prone to an attack of spiritual depression than at any other time."

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And there are great illustrations of this in the Scriptures.

383
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 The reality is we are body, we are mind, and we are spirit.

384
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And God is the creator of all things, of all three.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 We're embodied souls.

386
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And so we're not going to spend a ton of time on this,

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 but some of you, you've lost your zeal for God.

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And you're blaming God, and you're blaming community, and you're angry.

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And the reality is your rhythms, your habits are out of whack.

390
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And God, like Elijah, will start in your life there.

391
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 You know, for me, so my wife and I, three kids,

392
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 a little different season than most of you, but at the end, we do dinner time.

393
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 We play and wrestle, get a black eye from my 2-year-old.

394
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Then we give them a bath.

395
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 We put them down.

396
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And then my wife nurses our youngest.

397
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And I kind of clean the kitchen.

398
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 If Jen's watching, I clean the kitchen.

399
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And I just kind of relax and turn off my brain.

400
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 I've been doing this thing where I pull up the YouTube shorts, okay?

401
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 So it's not Reels.

402
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 It's not TikTok, okay?

403
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 But it got me.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 YouTube shorts got me.

405
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And it's action film scenes that I've never seen that I don't care about,

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 but I'm like, "Oh," you know, and I'm watching.

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Or it's random politicians yelling about things.

408
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I don't even know what they're yelling about, but I'm, "Oh," you know.

409
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And I just glued into this, and I spend an hour barely doing anything in the kitchen.

410
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Then Jen's like, "Come on, are we going to hang out?"

411
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah."

412
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Then I get the kitchen.

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Then I'm so exhausted.

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Then I wake up late, you know, because I went to bed late.

415
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Then I'm rushing in the morning.

416
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Then I'm getting to work.

417
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And it's like, wow, this has become a routine in my life.

418
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And I didn't even -- I wasn't, like, trying.

419
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It just came upon me.

420
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And some of you, this is happening in your life.

421
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 I was writing down, you know, some of you -- we don't talk about this a lot,

422
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 but maybe it's video games.

423
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Come on.

424
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Come on.

425
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Some of you, you're like, "It's my community, man."

426
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And you stay up until 3 a.m. with your community, man, playing video games,

427
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 which I have nothing against, but I'm just saying you're doing that.

428
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And people who care about you in your life are like, "Hey, maybe that's too much."

429
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And you're like, "Stop it!"

430
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Right?

431
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And you don't let them in.

432
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And I'm going, God, maybe like Elijah, would go, "Hey, hey, hey,

433
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 let's start with the video games."

434
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Right?

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Doesn't sound spiritual.

436
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 You know, some of you, it's your friends, it's your girlfriends, right?

437
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And they always get you with that text of like, "Hey, you want to take a sweet trip?"

438
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Right?

439
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Uh-oh, heading home.

440
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And you know, I already brushed my teeth, right?

441
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But you fall for it every time, and you're going because the memes, right?

442
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And I got to lock back in, Kylan.

443
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But you fall for it.

444
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And here's all I'm saying.

445
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 We're going to move on to the next point.

446
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Here's what I'm saying.

447
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Sometimes your zeal that you want to blame on God's just not present.

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 The first thing, the first thing is analyzing, taking a diagnosis of your

449
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 life and your habits and going, "Where am I out of whack?"

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And God wants to meet us there first.

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 God cares about the body as well as the soul.

452
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 That's the first thing.

453
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Number two, what does God do to restore the zeal in Elijah just like he does with us?

454
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Number two is God offers his presence in the silence.

455
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So God deals with him by going after his physiology.

456
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But then what he does is he offers his presence in the silence.

457
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Let's pick it up in verse 8.

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 So look again at verse 8.

459
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 We read this before, but look at it again.

460
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It says, "And he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food

461
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 40 days and 40 nights to Horeb, the Mount of God.

462
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And there he came to a cave," take note of that, "and lodged in it."

463
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 He's doing a lot of sleeping.

464
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Found a cave, he's sleeping.

465
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "And behold, the word of the Lord came to him and said to him, 'What are you

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 doing here, Elijah?'

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And he said," in verse 10, he's got his speech, "I have been very jealous for the

468
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Lord, the God of hosts.

469
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars,

470
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left.

471
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And they seek my life to take it away.

472
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And God said, 'Go out, get out of the cave, and stand on the mount before the

473
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Lord.' And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the

474
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord.

475
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 But the Lord was not in the wind.

476
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake.

477
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire.

478
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.

479
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood

480
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 at the entrance of the cave."

481
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Do you catch what God said at the beginning?

482
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 So Elijah goes, he finds a cave, he goes to the cave, and God says, "What are you

483
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 doing here?"

484
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I was just thinking about each of you tonight.

485
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 I just wonder if God were to come to you right now in your seat here at the

486
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 porch, and were to say, "Hey, what are you doing here?"

487
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 What would you say to him?

488
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I mean, I'm serious.

489
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 What would you say to God?

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Would you say, man, if you were honest, like gut level honest, you say, "Man, I'm

491
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 just kind of lonely in this season of life."

492
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And to be honest, to just be in a place where there are other young adults would

493
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 be amazing.

494
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Some of you, if you were honest, you're like, "Man, the bar's not the best place

495
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 to find a lover, so the porch is where I'm at."

496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 You know?

497
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I mean, that's where you're here.

498
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And some of you, if you're honest, you've got that longing, like, "Man, God, I

499
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 really want to meet with you."

500
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Like that music where you're singing, like, "I just want to."

501
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 But what is it?

502
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 See, here's the deal.

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 God comes with those words to Elijah, and Elijah has his speech ready.

504
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And he's ticked.

505
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 You can hear it in this.

506
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 He goes, "Man, you want to know why I'm here?

507
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Because I was jealous for you," which is the Hebrew word for zealous.

508
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 "I was passionate about you, and I went and I long-suffering loved on these

509
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 people and was with them, and nothing, nothing.

510
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I'm the only one, God, who still loves you.

511
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Everybody else has forsaken you.

512
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 I'm the only one left.

513
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 You want to know why I'm here?

514
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 That's why."

515
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And God's like, "That's cute.

516
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 That's awesome."

517
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 He says, "Then think about this."

518
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 He goes, "You want to actually experience me?"

519
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Now, Elijah, he's ticked.

520
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He's in his cave, you know.

521
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "You want to experience me?"

522
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 He's like, "Okay," you know.

523
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Now, here's the deal.

524
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 He's at Mount Horeb, which you go, "Big, big deal.

525
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 I don't know Mount Horeb."

526
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Mount Horeb has another name.

527
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 It's Mount Sinai.

528
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 This is the same mountain where Moses met God.

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And Moses goes, "God, I want to see you."

530
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And God says, "You can't see me?

531
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Are you kidding me?

532
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 You'll die.

533
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But if you hide in this cave behind the cleft of this rock,

534
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 you can see my back."

535
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 But now God's saying to Elijah, "Come out of the cave and

536
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 experience me."

537
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And Elijah all of a sudden is going, "Oh, man.

538
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 What even Moses couldn't do, I can do."

539
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And it's the fanfare you would expect.

540
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 A tornado rips through like DFW.

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 It's just, "Whoa," you know, rolling.

542
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 He's like, "Oh, this is God."

543
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And it rolls past.

544
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 He's like, "Man, God wasn't there."

545
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And then all of a sudden an earthquake starts.

546
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 He's like, "Oh, it's the earthquake."

547
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And God's not there.

548
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And then fire, like he saw at Mount Carmel, begins to come.

549
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And God's not there.

550
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And then all of a sudden there's a low whisper.

551
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 What Hebrews says is like a still silence.

552
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And it's in the still silence after all that's passed, God's there.

553
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And he wraps himself and he goes and appears before God.

554
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And, you know, it's interesting in light of Elijah's story, he was

555
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 expecting the big fanfare.

556
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 God, if you're real, show off like you're God.

557
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And he saw Mount Carmel and he saw the drought.

558
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 He was part of raising a young boy from the dead.

559
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And yet all of those things passed and it didn't bring revival.

560
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And now God's going, "Look, I work in those big things.

561
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I move in power."

562
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 When the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost, it's a breath, it's a wind.

563
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 When God speaks to Moses in the burning bush, it's a fire.

564
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And yet the normal day-to-day way that God speaks is through a gentle,

565
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 soft whisper.

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And the question that God's asking Elijah is the question he's asking us

567
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 in 2025.

568
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Are you willing to meet with me in the whisper?

569
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Are you willing to meet with me when the fanfare all goes away?

570
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 When the camp high is gone?

571
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 When the breakup happens?

572
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 When you lose the job?

573
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Are you willing in that place of brokenness to go, "God, you feel

574
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 really distant right now.

575
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 But even in the quiet, I want you."

576
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 And I think, I mean, God has moved in power throughout the Bible and he's

577
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 moved in power throughout history in massive moves of revival.

578
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 But I believe that if God was going to move in powerful nationwide revival

579
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 today, it would start in solitude.

580
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 It would start with a group of young adults going, "This whole thing is

581
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 great, but what I'm most hungry for, oh, just give me some space alone

582
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 with God."

583
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And so why do you think Satan attacks the secret place, the silent place

584
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 most?

585
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Have you ever tried to just get away alone in the quiet with God?

586
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Have you ever tried?

587
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Your mind starts racing, people start distracting you, your phone blows up.

588
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It's like all of a sudden your mother -- you don't have a mother-in-law,

589
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 but your mom, you know, starts like really bugging you about all kinds of

590
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 things and you're like, "What, Mom?

591
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I'm trying to get some alone time," right?

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And it's because Satan's working through your mom, maybe not, but, you

593
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 know, but you know it's that place God's trying to attack.

594
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Here's the reality.

595
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 If you try to meet with God in the silence, it's hard, but God is there.

596
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 I remember the first time that I was single before I was married, I went out

597
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 into the woods to put my phone away, just my Bible and a journal.

598
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 I was like, "God, I just want you to meet with me."

599
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 I'm like, "Come on, silence, alone time, this is going to be amazing."

600
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 I remember sitting down, opening up my journal, I'm starting to write.

601
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 I'm just looking around like, "God, you're so awesome.

602
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Man, look at the birds and the trees.

603
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And why am I still single?

604
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 And God, what's the little joke going on with my job?"

605
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And all of a sudden it just got dark, you know, like --

606
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And the reality is we so often suppress what we're really feeling with noise.

607
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And when we do that, we miss God in the silence.

608
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And I have a million more things to say on this, but in Christianity today,

609
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 we're just obsessed with hype.

610
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 We just are.

611
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And I think there's some of us, there's a remnant of you in here who go,

612
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 "Hey, I'm good with hype.

613
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 I'm not a hater on that stuff.

614
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I just -- man, where's the place where I can just be alone with God?"

615
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And I really believe that when that starts happening, revival will break out.

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Tyler Staten says, "Prayer is a journey that starts with need,

617
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 but it ends with relationship."

618
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 You start coming to God with, "I need, I need, I need,"

619
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 and then all of a sudden you begin to meet with God in relationship and silence.

620
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 When you really love someone, you don't need to be talking.

621
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 You want to, but there are times just being together is enough.

622
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And God goes, "Is that enough?

623
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Is it enough to just be with you?"

624
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 The first thing is God cares for the body as well as the soul.

625
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 If you've lost your zeal, start there.

626
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 The second is God offers his presence in the silence.

627
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 And number three is God reveals he's working in ways we can't see.

628
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 He's working in ways that we can't see.

629
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Let's pick it up and read the rest.

630
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 So let's start in the second half of verse 13.

631
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 It says, "And behold, there came a voice to him, to Elijah,

632
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and he asked again, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'

633
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And Elijah said his same speech again.

634
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 'I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts,

635
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant,

636
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 thrown down your altars, killed your prophets with the sword,

637
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 and I, even I only am left, and they seek to take away--

638
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 and they seek my life to take it away.'

639
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And the Lord said to him," this is interesting.

640
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 This will go over your head if you're just reading it.

641
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 He says, "Go, return on your way where you came from

642
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 to the wilderness of Damascus.

643
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria,

644
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 and Jehu, the son of Nimshi, you shall appoint to be king over Israel.

645
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And Elisha, the son of Shaphab of Abel-mehola,

646
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.

647
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death,

648
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death."

649
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Verse 18, "Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel,

650
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 all the knees that have not bowed to Baal,

651
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 and every mouth that has not kissed him."

652
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 So God asked Elijah the same question again,

653
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 and I've wondered, why did God do this?

654
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Is it because he didn't understand Elijah's answer the first time?

655
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Is it that Elijah got the wrong--he said the wrong thing?

656
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 And I think it's that God's testing his heart.

657
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Hey, did my experience--did your encounter with me in the silence change?

658
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And we see it didn't. He's still stubborn.

659
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And so God takes a different approach this time.

660
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And this is what he does with us.

661
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 If you're in a suicidal, depressed time where you're just, "I'm just done. I'm just done."

662
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 God doesn't come going, "Well, get up!" He starts with care.

663
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Then he moves to an experience of his presence.

664
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And then he hits him with the hard truth.

665
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 The reality is Elijah had fled south to Jezreel,

666
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 and now God says, "No, I want you to go back to where you came from,

667
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 and I want you to anoint a pagan king,

668
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 and I want you to find your replacement,

669
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 which are relatively normal things for a prophet to do."

670
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 So he basically says, "Hey, I want you to go back from where you came from,

671
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 and I want you to do normal prophet things."

672
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 No fanfare, no credit, just what you're supposed to do.

673
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 And it's as though God is saying, "Hey, yeah, I do the Mount Carmel thing,

674
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 but it's not how I normally work.

675
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 I work and I speak in the midst of your normal life.

676
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I am working in ways that you can't see."

677
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 You know, it's interesting.

678
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 God is working in ways that we can't see

679
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 and that oftentimes it takes perspective later for us to see it.

680
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 You know, I think back to my story at the beginning,

681
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 and when I went to youth ministry,

682
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 so I was transferred from adult ministry to youth ministry,

683
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 and I was embarrassed at the beginning, and then something happened.

684
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 As I began to love on these middle school kids, my life came back.

685
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 You know, I began to teach the Bible,

686
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 and they're throwing paper airplanes in the back and picking their nose,

687
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 and I loved it, you know, and I began to disciple them and watch them grow.

688
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 And then I got a job in grapevine as a high school pastor, and I loved it.

689
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And then fast forward to a few years ago.

690
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 So I've left that job. I'm down in Houston.

691
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 I get a call from one of my former students who says, "Hey, I'm engaged,

692
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 and I'm about to get married to a girl who was in the youth group,"

693
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 and he said, "Will you officiate our wedding?"

694
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I'm like, "Oh, man, that's awesome."

695
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 So I drive up to Dallas, and I go there for the rehearsal,

696
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 and I see that, you know, when we do the rehearsal,

697
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 she's supposed to walk down with her dad,

698
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 and she's walking down the aisle alone in the rehearsal.

699
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 I'm like, "Hey, what's going on there?"

700
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 She said, "Hey, basically some things happened with my dad,

701
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and he's not going to be at the wedding.

702
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 He's kind of deserted our family in this season."

703
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 I was heartbroken for her.

704
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 And afterwards, I said, I pulled her aside.

705
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 I'm like, "Hey, no pressure, but would you be okay if I walk you down the aisle?"

706
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Little tears just started welling up in her eyes,

707
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 and she just said, "I would love that."

708
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 The craziest thing happens, and the next day it's the day of the wedding,

709
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 and my daughter is the flower girl, which was cute, you know,

710
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 and we're in the back.

711
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 The groomsmen have gone out.

712
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 The bridesmaids have gone out, and it's just me and my flower girl daughter

713
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 and this bride, my former student.

714
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 I remember looking at her.

715
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Now and then I got tears in my eyes.

716
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 She's got tears, and I just look at her and go, "You are so beautiful,

717
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 and I'm so proud of you."

718
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 And I started walking this girl down the aisle in the church

719
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 where I was a youth pastor.

720
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 And I just in that moment was so surreal,

721
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 but it was like God was looking down, and he was just going, "See? See?"

722
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 So you couldn't see it.

723
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 When you were a youth pastor just ordering another round of pizza,

724
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 just dealing with another dramatic high schooler and all their issues,

725
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 just dealing with another parent yelling at you about how someone --

726
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 What you can't see, Tyler, is one day -- stay faithful, man.

727
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 One day you're going to be able to walk one of these girls down the aisle

728
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 and make her day being a father figure for her in this moment.

729
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 You can't see it, but stay faithful, man.

730
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 There's perspective if you keep going.

731
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And I just tell you, some of you, you've lost your zeal going,

732
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 "This is pointless, and I'm going."

733
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 I promise you on the authority of the Bible,

734
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 if you stay tethered to God, and you remember,

735
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 "He's doing something I can't see,"

736
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 then I promise one day when perspective hits,

737
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 either on this life or the life to come, you'll see it.

738
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 You'll see the picture that God was weaving together

739
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 that right now in your young adult years you couldn't see.

740
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 John Mark Comer says, "The truest sign of maturity

741
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 is finding the goodness of God in your actual life."

742
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 You want to know if you're mature?

743
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 That's how you know you're mature.

744
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 I want to end quickly with two takeaways,

745
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 and we're going to fly here, and then we're done.

746
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Takeaway number one is, as we think about zeal,

747
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 the first is we need a correct understanding of the gospel.

748
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 If you want to have your zeal, your life, your passions restored,

749
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 number one is you need a correct understanding of the gospel.

750
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 The truth is Elijah was too optimistic

751
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 and too pessimistic at the same time.

752
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 He was too optimistic.

753
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 He thought, "God, if you send the drought,

754
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 if you rain down fire from heaven,

755
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 if the people see it, then revival will break out.

756
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 I'm sure of it." He was too optimistic.

757
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 When it didn't happen, he was depressed,

758
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 and he flipped over to being too pessimistic.

759
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 That didn't work out, so then he's going, "Forget it.

760
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 It's all done. Nothing can happen."

761
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 He did this emotional swing, and the reality is

762
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 the gospel goes after both.

763
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Tim Keller says, "The gospel is this.

764
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves

765
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time,

766
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ

767
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 than we ever dared hope."

768
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 At the same time, our pessimism and our over-optimism

769
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 is confronted with a man, a God-man,

770
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 hanging on a tree that's going,

771
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 "You are so much more broken.

772
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 You think you're bad right now?

773
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Oh, I'm just so bad. You're way worse."

774
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 A bloody Savior on a cross declares,

775
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 "You're far worse than you even think you are,"

776
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 and yet that bloody Savior on the cross declares to you,

777
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 "You are far more loved than you have even the capacity

778
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 to understand."

779
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 You're way too optimistic of what you think of yourself.

780
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 The gospel declares both, and then the second thing,

781
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 the last thing, is that the fire of godly zeal

782
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 is stoked with surrender regardless of circumstance.

783
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 This is a lot, but this is so important.

784
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 The fire of godly zeal is stoked with surrender

785
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 regardless of circumstance.

786
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Some of you refuse to see zeal for God as an option

787
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 because in your situation--

788
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 because in your mind, your situation is too dark.

789
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 It's too hard. It's too broken.

790
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And until my circumstance changes,

791
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 I cannot be passionate for God.

792
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 And I just want to tell you it's not true.

793
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 It's not true.

794
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 I think we have time. One last quick story.

795
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Man, when I was in Houston,

796
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 I had the chance to go to a maximum security prison

797
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 a few times.

798
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Not because I was the prisoner, but to visit.

799
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 And man, as I would go, I remember the first time I went,

800
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 I kind of was--I went begrudging.

801
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 I was like, "Ah, I'm a pastor. I should probably do this.

802
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 And I got to go love on all these broken people."

803
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 And then I step into this chapel service

804
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 of life sentence guys.

805
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 And I saw a worshiper. You thought today was cool.

806
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 I saw a worshiper like I've never seen.

807
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 I start hearing each of these guys' stories,

808
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 and I'm just blown away by their willingness

809
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 to talk about their brokenness

810
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 and their ability to accurately communicate

811
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 the full extent of the gospel

812
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 and how it's changed their life.

813
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And yet every guy I would meet, I'd hear their story.

814
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 It was crazy. And then they'd go,

815
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, my story's crazy,

816
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 but you got to hear John's story."

817
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 I'm like, "Okay." And then the next guy,

818
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 his story's crazy. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,

819
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 my story's crazy, but you got to hear John's story."

820
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 I'm like, "Where's John?" You know?

821
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 And they're like, "He's down, he's back behind

822
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 the sound booth running slides for chapel."

823
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 I'm like, "All right." So I go find him,

824
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 and I'm like, "John, right?"

825
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 He's like, "Yep." I'm like,

826
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 "I heard you have a crazy story."

827
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 He's like, "Oh yeah, let's go sit down."

828
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 And so we go sit down, and John says,

829
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 I'm gonna tell you the abbreviated version,

830
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 but he says, "Man, Tyler, I did a lot of things wrong

831
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 when I was young. 21 years old,

832
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 I ended up with a life sentence in this prison.

833
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 I'm never getting out."

834
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 He said, "When I came here, I had a one-year-old son,

835
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 and I loved that son with my whole life.

836
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 I would live just for visitation to see my little buddy."

837
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 He said, "In the course of years in this prison,

838
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 I actually met God and surrendered my life to Jesus,

839
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 and would just spend that time with my son

840
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 just proclaiming the gospel to him."

841
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 Fast forward 18 years, his son is murdered by another man.

842
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 John's obviously heartbroken.

843
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 And through COVID, this happened pre-COVID,

844
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 in the midst of COVID, there was a shakeup of the prison,

845
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 and the man who killed John's son ended up at his prison.

846
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 And not only that, this man ended up in his cell block.

847
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 And so John knows who this guy is.

848
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 This guy doesn't know who John is.

849
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 And all the guys in the cell block go,

850
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 "Bro, we'll get you alone so you can kill him."

851
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 John's telling me this, I'm like, "What?

852
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 That's a crazy story, right?"

853
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 And he goes, "Man, I remember I went up

854
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 and I talked to this man who killed my son,

855
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 and I said, I just started asking him questions,

856
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 just kind of interview, you know, just like getting after him."

857
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 And the guy finally goes, "Man, who are you?"

858
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 And John goes, "Man, my name's John. You murdered my son."

859
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 And the guy, little scrawny guy, goes in the corner,

860
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 he's like, "Man, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

861
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 I didn't mean to all get transferred out."

862
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 And John goes, "Hey, me and you are talking tomorrow."

863
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 And John goes into his cell block, into his cell,

864
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 and he gets on his face alone in the silence before God

865
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 and pours out his heart to God.

866
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 This is a broken man with a past

867
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 who surrendered his life to Jesus

868
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 on the floor of a dirty prison cell.

869
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 God, everything in me wants to kill this man.

870
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Everything in me from a justice standpoint thinks it's right.

871
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Even my buddies in the prison, what are they going to do?

872
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 Throw me in prison if I kill him?

873
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Like, this is what I'm going to do.

874
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 He's just confronted with the God who forgave him.

875
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 And as he's there, it's just God gently following this path,

876
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 cared for him, met with him, spoke to him.

877
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 And as he spoke to him, it was a reminder of,

878
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 "John, right now in the midst of where you're at,

879
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 I forgave you way more than what you even realize.

880
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 You can forgive this man."

881
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 And, "John, you must forgive this man,

882
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
 or you will be the one who dies.

883
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 You'll be the one spending the rest of your life

884
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 living in that vengeance.

885
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 You must forgive."

886
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 Next day, John goes and meets with this man.

887
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 He says, "I'm not going to kill you.

888
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 I'm going to tell you about someone who changed my life."

889
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 And he shares the gospel with this man.

890
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 This man's hardened, so John comes back the next day

891
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 and the next day and the next day.

892
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 And after a matter of weeks, finally, that hard shell breaks.

893
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
 And this man, he surrenders his life to Jesus,

894
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 receives forgiveness, not only from John, but from God.

895
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
 And then over the next year, John discipled this man.

896
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 Think about this.

897
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 And then a year later, they transferred this man

898
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 out of the prison, and John's telling me now in tears,

899
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 he said, "When they transferred him out,

900
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 it was like I was losing my own son."

901
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 Now, I'm losing it right here in this story.

902
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 I'm like, "What?"

903
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 You know, and he's losing it.

904
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
 And here's why I wanted to end with that.

905
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 I know some of you.

906
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Some of you, you're at the porch, you're just excited.

907
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 This is great.

908
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 Some of you, though, you are walking through dark, dark, dark seasons,

909
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 and you're thinking, "There's no way.

910
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 There is no possible way I can walk with God

911
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
 in the midst of this season and have zeal and passion for him."

912
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 And I'm going, "I know.

913
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 On your own strength, absolutely not.

914
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 But with the God who worked in a dirty prison cell in John's life,

915
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 he can work in yours.

916
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 Don't wait for your circumstance to change.

917
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 Surrender to a God who meets us in the still silence

918
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 right where you're at."

919
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 And that can happen right now, right now.

920
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 Let's pray.

921
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 Father, more than anything else,

922
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 we long to encounter the still small voice.

923
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 Yes, we want the fanfare.

924
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 Yes, we want the hype at times.

925
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 But there's a generation, a remnant of young adults

926
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
 who we've seen that show.

927
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 We're not angry about it.

928
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 There's got to be something more, and there is.

929
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Lord, I just pray tonight, I'm feeling this tug,

930
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 that there's some people here who have never had that dirty cell room,

931
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 prison cell floor moment of surrender to Jesus.

932
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
 Lord, I pray today is that day.

933
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 No circumstance change.

934
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 The darkness is still there.

935
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 The silence still feels quiet.

936
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
 And yet, I need that.

937
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 I need that.

938
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 Lord, I pray that the gospel would ring out

939
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 that God loved us far more than we can imagine,

940
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 despite us being far worse than we even know.

941
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 And Lord, would your spirit meet us right now?

942
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
 Would we see Jesus and surrender fully to him?

943
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 Some tonight would go, "I'm in. I am all in for that."

944
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 And they would just say simply, "Father, I receive your grace.

945
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 I confess that I'm in such darkness right now, and I need you.

946
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 Jesus, come. Be my sacrifice. Be my everything."

947
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 Even in the still, small voice.

948
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I love you, and I trust you.

949
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Now we pray all this in Jesus' name.

950
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
 Amen.

951
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
 Amen.

952
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,060
 you
