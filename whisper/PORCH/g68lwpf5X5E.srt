1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:27,540
 Love it.

3
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,460
 Hello friends in the room, hello friends in Fort Worth

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,780
 and in Houston, I'm gonna start with a story

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,340
 that'll kind of give us traction for where we're going.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,740
 A couple weeks ago on a Tuesday,

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,020
 we had our staff play day, Watermark, as a staff,

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,820
 once a year does like a play day where we go out

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,660
 and do some sort of game or team bonding,

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,580
 staff-wide competition together.

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,740
 And on that day we had a great day,

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,900
 we did this like bow and arrow, Hunger Games,

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,540
 essentially thing as a staff, and had a ton of fun.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,460
 It was a great Tuesday.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,340
 We then had the porch that night.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,140
 The porch was awesome, it was Adam and Eve,

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,920
 JP kicked it off talking about,

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,860
 or kicked off the BC series talking about Adam and Eve

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,740
 and it was just an awesome night.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,700
 Finished the porch, head home at like 10.30,

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,420
 end up getting ready for bed,

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,380
 kissing my wife, we're going to bed, it's 11.15

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,660
 and I get a text message from our senior pastor,

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,420
 Todd Wagner, and it says, "Hey, are you up?

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,740
 "If so, call me."

26
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,980
 And immediately I'm thinking like,

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,780
 oh my God, well, I'm up now, okay?

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,220
 And this would be like your CEO, your boss's boss,

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,340
 texting you late at night, be like,

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,460
 hey, can we talk right now?

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,700
 At 11.15, so this is very unusual,

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,340
 never happened before, unusual,

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,380
 and I'm like, oh my gosh, what could be possibly going on?

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
 Do I, what do I do now?

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,260
 Do I act like, oh, I'm asleep, or do I respond?

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,660
 And I've started the dots, so he knows that I'm awake.

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,500
 And so I call him and I'm like, hey man, what's going on?

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,020
 And I'm waiting to see like,

39
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,820
 what could this possibly be about?

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,300
 It's 11.15 at night.

41
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,500
 And he begins to like start small talk,

42
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,780
 he's like, hey, how was the porch tonight?

43
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,100
 And I'm like, it was great, I'm sure this is not

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,060
 why you wanna talk on the phone right now.

45
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,800
 It was great, it was an awesome night,

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,360
 and tell him what went down, and he goes,

47
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,380
 oh, that's great, man.

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,980
 Hey, tell me, how old are you when your parents split up?

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,900
 And I'm thinking, what, where is this going right now?

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,220
 What are you asking me about?

51
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,540
 Am I delusional right now?

52
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,060
 And I answer, well, and he refers to part of my story

53
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,580
 is my parents divorced when I was 12.

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,780
 And I said, well, that's kind of hard to answer,

55
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,660
 'cause they divorced officially when I was 12 years old,

56
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,660
 and they split up a little bit back and forth before then,

57
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,660
 and literally true story, this is what happens next.

58
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,780
 All the while, I'm thinking like,

59
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,940
 where could this possibly be going?

60
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,460
 You just wanted a bio late at night?

61
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,380
 What is going on?

62
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,660
 And next thing that happens, he goes, oh, huh, that's great.

63
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,020
 Hey, somebody just walked in the house.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,620
 Can I call you back in 30 minutes?

65
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,860
 (laughing)

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,900
 Oh man, I can't believe this happened, I love it.

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,980
 And I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to sleep now.

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,500
 I have no idea where this is going.

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,540
 Literally what's going through my head

70
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,740
 is where could he possibly be going?

71
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,660
 Why does he want, what are we even talking about?

72
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
 Did he like see some father wound today

73
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,540
 on that bow and arrow court that he's like,

74
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,300
 hey, we just need to talk about this right now.

75
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,100
 Or did he, I don't know if he like wants to adopt me.

76
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
 I don't know what is going on,

77
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,660
 and what he could possibly be asking me these questions for.

78
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,660
 And so eventually, you know, we end up talking later,

79
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,660
 and he basically says, hey, I wanted you to teach

80
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,060
 this Sunday, and it was related to Mother's Day

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,580
 and part of my story growing up.

82
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,060
 And I'm like, oh my gosh, why didn't you just lead with that?

83
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,260
 Because I'm like, where could we possibly be going

84
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,380
 with this at this moment in time?

85
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,060
 And the reason I start there is because,

86
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,180
 let me say this, what happened there,

87
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,620
 I think parallels this, or tells me something

88
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,540
 about the relationship that I have with Todd.

89
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,100
 Although I was trying to connect the dots,

90
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,780
 which I don't know if you've ever been there before.

91
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,380
 I feel like we're constantly there trying

92
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,300
 to connect the dots on like at work or with a relationship,

93
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,260
 or when someone says something,

94
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,220
 where are you going with this?

95
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,900
 In that moment, I'm trying to connect the dots with Todd.

96
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,700
 Where could he possibly be going with this?

97
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,540
 But all the scenarios that I thought of

98
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,620
 of where he could be going,

99
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,900
 none of them were like off the deep end, horrible.

100
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,660
 I knew he wasn't calling me to say,

101
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,460
 hey, just wanted to let you know I hate you.

102
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,660
 Or hey, you're fired from your job,

103
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,260
 or we're sending you to Mongolia.

104
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,380
 And congratulations.

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,940
 I knew, just based on our relationship, I love it.

106
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,900
 Just based on our relationship,

107
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,340
 courtesy laugh, my man, that's what I'm talking about.

108
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,120
 Just based on our relationship of trust,

109
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,620
 that wherever he was going,

110
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,220
 it wasn't going to be somewhere like that.

111
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,100
 I still wondered, where are we going with this?

112
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
 But because of just the trust I know Todd,

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,220
 have a relationship with him,

114
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,060
 I knew that it wasn't going somewhere bad.

115
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,580
 And really, any relationship that's marked by trust,

116
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,020
 all relationships at the heart of a healthy relationship

117
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,060
 is required trust.

118
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,820
 Like for any relationship in your life or my life,

119
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,860
 I cannot have a healthy relationship

120
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,460
 without this idea of trust.

121
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,940
 That thing that fills in the gap when you're like,

122
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,980
 I don't know where this is going, but I trust this person.

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,300
 Some of you guys have had relational issues in the past.

124
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,420
 You even call them.

125
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,720
 You're like, hey, I haven't had healthy relationships

126
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,980
 because I'm a person who has relationship problems,

127
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,420
 and you call them trust problems.

128
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,860
 Trust is at the epicenter of every healthy relationship.

129
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,420
 And the reason I start there is because

130
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,760
 when it comes to the pages of scripture,

131
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,620
 really the Bible teaches that God has invited all of us

132
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,820
 through Jesus into a relationship with him.

133
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,380
 And a relationship that at the heart of it

134
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,400
 is to be marked by trust, a trust in God.

135
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
 That if we're to have a healthy relationship,

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,860
 trust is at the epicenter of this.

137
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,820
 And so tonight, as it relates to this relationship

138
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,180
 that God's called us into, a relationship that,

139
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,480
 although at times, just like with Todd, with God,

140
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,860
 we won't always know, hey, where is this going, God?

141
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,000
 Where are you taking this?

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,420
 Where, my circumstances, my job,

143
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,180
 what are you doing with this relationship

144
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,900
 that I was, my dating world,

145
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,220
 I thought it was going in one direction

146
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,780
 and it totally changed.

147
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,980
 What are you up to, God?

148
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,140
 Where are you going with this?

149
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,380
 In the same way, when we ask that question,

150
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,680
 we are to then experience this level of trust

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,700
 that defines our really existence.

152
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,100
 We can go, hey, I don't know where this is going,

153
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,380
 but I trust you, Lord.

154
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,580
 And so tonight, we're gonna discover from a man

155
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,580
 who was called the father of trust, or the father of faith.

156
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,780
 Other places call him the man of faith,

157
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,620
 the man of trust, a guy who like,

158
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,200
 if anybody got this thing right,

159
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,300
 he got an A in how to trust God.

160
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,260
 A man by the name of Abraham.

161
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,900
 That's right, there you go, come on.

162
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,540
 Father Abraham had many sons.

163
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,860
 I'm one of them and,

164
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,500
 boom, man, this crowd does not go to vacation Bible school

165
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,100
 when they were kids, that is unbelievable.

166
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,220
 What is wrong with you people?

167
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,100
 We're gonna look at Abraham.

168
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,060
 If you don't know who Abraham is,

169
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,900
 Abraham is one of the most influential figures in history.

170
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,300
 The three biggest religions, Christianity, Judaism,

171
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,780
 and Islam all trace back to this one man.

172
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,540
 Abraham is at the center of really the Christian faith

173
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,700
 and one of the most important people.

174
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,580
 And he was a man who models for us.

175
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,500
 We're gonna look at his story, look at his story,

176
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,660
 and discover how we can, in the midst of wondering,

177
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,500
 where are you going with this, God?

178
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,140
 I can trust you and learn from his example

179
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,540
 and learn from some of his mistakes.

180
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,240
 So we're gonna trace through his story.

181
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,260
 This will be in Genesis 12 through 22.

182
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,580
 Yeah, buckle up.

183
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,060
 12 through 22, we're not gonna look at all of it.

184
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,780
 I'm gonna fly through some of his story

185
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,220
 and we're gonna look at three parts of Abraham,

186
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,140
 this man of trust story.

187
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,940
 So we'll start in chapter 12.

188
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,460
 All the verses will be on the screen.

189
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,340
 And we'll kind of walk through each section by section

190
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,460
 and look what we can learn from this man

191
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,700
 who modeled what it looks like to have faith,

192
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,980
 have trust, and how we can get there.

193
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,620
 So we'll start in Genesis 12, verse one.

194
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,420
 And I'll read the first four verses.

195
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,380
 We'll talk about it for a little bit.

196
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,820
 Where is God taking us?

197
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,920
 Here we go, so verse one of chapter 12.

198
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,820
 The Lord said to Abram,

199
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,520
 this was before he has a name change,

200
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,740
 which will make sense in a couple chapters.

201
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,100
 He doesn't have the H and the A yet,

202
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,940
 but Abram will become Abraham.

203
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,340
 The Lord said to Abram, "Go from your country,

204
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,060
 "from your people, your father's house,

205
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,520
 "to the land I will show you.

206
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,280
 "I will make you a great nation.

207
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,640
 "I will bless you.

208
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,500
 "I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.

209
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,340
 "I will bless those who bless you

210
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,460
 "and curse whoever curses you.

211
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,920
 "And all peoples of earth will be blessed through you."

212
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,760
 So Abraham went.

213
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,160
 As the Lord had told him, and Lot, his nephew,

214
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,980
 went with him.

215
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,020
 Abraham was 75 years old when he set off from Haran.

216
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,960
 So here's what just happened.

217
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,420
 God shows up to Abe.

218
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,720
 Abraham hanging on the scene.

219
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,160
 He's 75, like he wants to be playing golf in Malibu,

220
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,080
 retired.

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,640
 God shows up and says, "Hey, I have different plans for you.

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
 "I want you to go, Abraham.

223
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,180
 "I'm gonna do something with you through your family,

224
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,660
 "through your descendants, and through your line.

225
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,000
 "And I'm gonna do something that'll bless the whole world.

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
 "But the first thing I need you to do is I need you to go.

227
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,680
 "Go where, God?"

228
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,220
 God literally says, "Hey, just go

229
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,340
 "and I will tell you when you will be there.

230
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,240
 "I'll tell you when to stop.

231
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,380
 "Should I stop in Canaan?

232
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,220
 "I'll tell you.

233
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,000
 "I just want you to go and trust me with the destinations."

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
 Our first idea, really, from the story of Abraham's life

235
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,560
 is this idea of what it looks like to trust God

236
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,700
 means trusting him with the destinations in our life.

237
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
 Trusting him with where he's leading.

238
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,780
 For us, for Abraham, that just meant

239
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,180
 his next stopping ground for all of us

240
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,460
 were in this series of destinations through life.

241
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,200
 Destination of who you're gonna marry,

242
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,240
 where you're gonna work, where you're gonna live,

243
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
 who you are gonna exist in a relationship,

244
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,220
 where you're gonna go to church,

245
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,840
 what job you're gonna work at,

246
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,020
 the amount that you're gonna make.

247
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,920
 All these different, the length of days that you will have,

248
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,500
 God says, "I want you to trust me with the destinations.

249
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,680
 "I just want you to focus on going.

250
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,220
 "I want you to walk in total dependence on me, Abraham.

251
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,180
 "And he may not send you from Dallas,

252
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,860
 "but he has invited you to live in this moment-by-moment

253
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,900
 "trust relationship with God.

254
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,120
 "That I want you to trust me

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,960
 "with the destinations of your life."

256
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,160
 And God shows up to Abraham,

257
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,120
 and Abraham, the first thing he shows us is,

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,160
 "Hey, I'm gonna trust you, Lord, wherever you take me."

259
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,380
 Which, honestly, is so hard for me

260
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,220
 because there's part of me,

261
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,480
 and I think it's really all of us,

262
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,240
 but maybe I'll just talk about me

263
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
 so that I'm not sharing the guilt.

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
 It's all of us, though, right?

265
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,480
 That I just wanna know more of the plan.

266
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,980
 Like, God, hey, I just want you to tell me,

267
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,820
 just fill in the gaps.

268
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,280
 Like, I wish from a very early age,

269
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,700
 everything that we played as little kids,

270
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,480
 whether it's "MASH" with the little paper thing

271
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
 you fold out and like,

272
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,200
 "Oh, you're gonna live in an apartment, Mary D. Sally."

273
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,280
 Or you're gonna play with the magic eight ball,

274
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,000
 and you're like, "Lord, am I supposed to work here?

275
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 "No, maybe, okay, it's broken."

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,840
 I wanna know what the plan are.

277
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,880
 God, will you just tell me, we fill in the gaps.

278
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,640
 I don't wanna trust you with the destination.

279
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,160
 Will you just tell me my future?

280
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,880
 And I think Abraham models really something

281
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,840
 that's true for all of us,

282
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,620
 that God is less concerned about you and I

283
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,560
 knowing the future,

284
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
 and more concerned with us knowing him.

285
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
 Like, I wanna know, specifically,

286
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,160
 even today I was joking with our team,

287
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,560
 like, I often wanna know, like,

288
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,120
 how many years am I gonna live?

289
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,580
 What, 31 years, 35, 51, 75?

290
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,060
 'Cause that may impact how I plan things out down here, Lord.

291
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,000
 And I think God just says,

292
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,560
 "I want you to trust me."

293
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,800
 Day by day, moment by moment, dependence.

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
 He's inviting all of us into this relationship

295
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,200
 where day by day, I'm gonna trust you, Lord.

296
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,640
 Whatever you call me to today,

297
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,040
 I'm gonna be faithful in that.

298
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,480
 Am I supposed to work at this job?

299
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,660
 I don't know.

300
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,880
 I do know how I'm supposed to work at this job.

301
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 Hard, faithfully, to be the best employee here.

302
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,080
 Am I supposed to marry Sally?

303
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,700
 Not me, 'cause I'm already married to Callie.

304
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,160
 But you, whoever it is.

305
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,300
 (audience laughing)

306
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,200
 That one's pretty clear.

307
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,120
 The Lord has spoken.

308
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,160
 (audience laughing)

309
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,140
 Am I supposed to marry this person?

310
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,440
 Maybe.

311
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,260
 I know how you're supposed to pursue them,

312
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,560
 how you're supposed to go about dating them

313
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,440
 if they are to be there.

314
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
 And God's more concerned with this moment by moment,

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,760
 daily trust, will you trust me?

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
 And he invites Abraham into this,

317
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,240
 and Abraham walks obediently with it.

318
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,880
 That's not all that happens.

319
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
 Here's what happens next.

320
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,680
 That just so reflects us and the trust issue.

321
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,480
 This happens in verse one of chapter 15.

322
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,080
 After this, so Abraham goes,

323
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,640
 God eventually says, "Stop right here."

324
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
 And then the Lord shows up later in his life,

325
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,420
 and this is what happens.

326
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,680
 After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision.

327
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,300
 And he said, "Do not be afraid, Abram.

328
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,640
 "I am your shield, your very great reward."

329
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,580
 Lord shows up and says, "Hey, I'm your shield.

330
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,480
 "I'm gonna protect you, Abram.

331
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,980
 "I am your reward.

332
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,020
 "You get me.

333
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,260
 "I just want you to know you're getting God.

334
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,340
 "You're getting the greatest thing

335
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,940
 "that could ever be given to you.

336
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,900
 "That's your reward at the end of the day."

337
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,380
 And I love his response because it's so us.

338
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,620
 Like God says, "Hey, you're gonna get me.

339
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,960
 "You're gonna get the best thing you could ever get, God."

340
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,380
 And here's what Abraham says.

341
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,860
 This is so us.

342
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,820
 But Abraham said, "What can you give me

343
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,740
 "since I remain childless, Lord?

344
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,300
 "And who will inherit my estate

345
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,540
 "besides Eleazar of Damascus?"

346
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,340
 Abraham said, "You've given me no children,

347
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,860
 "so a servant in my household will be my heir."

348
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,340
 That Abraham does what we do when we're told, like God,

349
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,820
 "Hey, you get to spend eternity with God

350
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,040
 "forever and ever and ever.

351
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
 "You're gonna be fully and finally satisfied.

352
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,340
 "This life is a vapor.

353
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,740
 "God, you get the greatest thing

354
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,660
 "that will ever be experienced for all of eternity."

355
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,800
 And we're like, "God, hey, I'm still single, God.

356
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,420
 "Could you please show up and do something down here?

357
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,060
 "That's gonna be really great up there.

358
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,460
 "I'm married to you forever,

359
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,660
 "but I'd still like to have some kids down here."

360
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,460
 I mean, it's like totally us.

361
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,580
 We just lose perspective.

362
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,740
 That's what Abraham does.

363
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,800
 And God responds despite that.

364
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,300
 And says this, "Then the word of the Lord came to him.

365
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,940
 "And he said, 'This man, Eleazar," poor Eleazar,

366
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,320
 "'This man, Eleazar, will not be your heir,'" verse four,

367
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,540
 "but a son who is your own flesh and blood

368
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,620
 "will be your heir.

369
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,620
 "Then God took him outside," 75-year-old Abraham, no kids.

370
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,000
 God says, "You're gonna have a kid.

371
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,980
 "Not only that, his kids and his kids

372
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,420
 "are gonna be more numerous than even the stars,"

373
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,240
 he says next.

374
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080
 He took him outside and says,

375
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,760
 "Look up at the sky and count the stars,

376
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,460
 "if indeed you can count them."

377
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,680
 Then he said to him, "So show your offspring."

378
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,180
 Where he takes him outside.

379
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,420
 And like if you have ever been camping

380
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,900
 in either West Texas, Colorado, wherever you go camping,

381
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,680
 not in Dallas when you look at the stars.

382
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,220
 Dallas, you see like three.

383
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,400
 And you're like, "Oh, that's a plane."

384
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,940
 Oh, that's two.

385
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,060
 And this, Abraham, from horizon to horizon,

386
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,820
 sees stars as far as the eye can see.

387
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,480
 And God says, "Try to count them.

388
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,340
 "This will be the number of descendants

389
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,260
 "that come from you, Abraham,

390
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,340
 "even though you have no child right now.

391
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,160
 "This is the future that I have for you.

392
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,980
 "Trust me with the destinations on the journey."

393
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,860
 And then a verse that really, this verse next,

394
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,640
 what Abraham does next is the foundation of Christianity.

395
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,860
 It's the foundation of faith.

396
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,960
 It's the foundation of a relationship with God,

397
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,380
 if you'll ever have one.

398
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,180
 Here's what Abraham does.

399
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,380
 Abraham believed the Lord, and it was credited,

400
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,460
 or counted, or declared to him as righteousness.

401
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,460
 What did that just mean?

402
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,160
 Abraham looked at the sky, and he said,

403
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,820
 "I believe you, Lord.

404
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,680
 "If you say this will be, I trust you.

405
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,100
 "I trust your promise."

406
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,060
 And in that moment of faith, all of a sudden,

407
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,900
 Abraham was given perfect righteousness with God.

408
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,040
 Not because of what he had done, or how he had acted,

409
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,060
 or did he behave, but because he believed.

410
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,180
 This is what Christianity is all about.

411
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,020
 If you're here, back in church for the first time

412
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,940
 in a long time, or maybe the first time ever,

413
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,260
 and you've ever wondered, what is the Bible about?

414
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,660
 What is Christianity about?

415
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,780
 The whole message of the Bible could be summed up

416
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,780
 in two words, God's invitation to man, saying, "Trust me.

417
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,800
 "I want you to trust me."

418
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,460
 That all of Christianity is about,

419
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,900
 not can you believe, or can you behave,

420
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,420
 but who do you believe in?

421
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,960
 Who have you put your trust in?

422
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,780
 The message of world religions is, can you behave?

423
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,700
 Have you behaved?

424
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,260
 That's what every other major world religion,

425
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,300
 I really wanna make sure we get this before we move on,

426
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,500
 every other major world religion teaches

427
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,420
 that the issue is, when it comes to God

428
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,740
 and man's relationship together, can you behave?

429
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,300
 Can you do enough good things?

430
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,980
 That's what all of them teach.

431
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,700
 And the message of Christianity is not, can you behave?

432
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
 It is, do you believe?

433
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,540
 Who have you trusted in?

434
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,860
 And Abraham believed, and in a moment,

435
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,860
 not based on how he behaved, but in who he believed.

436
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,940
 Everything changed.

437
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,580
 The father of our faith, he was declared righteous.

438
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,280
 You, in a moment of faith tonight,

439
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,380
 if you put your faith not in how good of a person you are,

440
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,220
 and I'm sure you're a nice person,

441
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,220
 but in Jesus's work on the cross to pay for your sin,

442
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,100
 because the reality is,

443
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,380
 you're not as nice as you think you are.

444
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,700
 You're not as good as you think you are, and neither am I.

445
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,240
 That's why we need a savior.

446
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,320
 And in a moment of belief, everything changed for Abraham.

447
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,500
 This verse, three times in the New Testament,

448
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,980
 the New Testament authors say,

449
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,800
 it's always been about, can you believe?

450
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,980
 It's never been about, can you behave?

451
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,900
 And Abraham believed, and perfect righteousness was his.

452
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,500
 So Abraham models this faith for us,

453
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,260
 but really, sadly for him,

454
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,460
 and really encouraging in a weird way for us,

455
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,780
 or giving us hope, he's just like many of us in the room,

456
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,360
 that at times, we express this incredible faith,

457
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,120
 but we have these waves of just, over time,

458
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,340
 as we look at our circumstances, and we're going,

459
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,660
 God, when are you gonna show up?

460
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,740
 And he has these moments of lapses in his life,

461
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,100
 and I'm gonna tell you about a couple of 'em

462
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,540
 where Abraham doesn't perfectly express faith,

463
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,420
 that although he said, God,

464
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,180
 I'm gonna trust you with the destinations,

465
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,700
 he found himself saying,

466
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,120
 I don't know if I can trust you in this situation.

467
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,020
 If you're in the room tonight,

468
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,940
 and you have something in your life,

469
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,820
 where you're like, I don't know if I trust

470
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,140
 what God is up to here,

471
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,780
 with what's going on in my work,

472
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,940
 with where, I don't even wanna live in this city, Dallas.

473
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,140
 I don't wanna be single.

474
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,860
 I don't wanna be, all my other friends have gotten married,

475
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,980
 they're having kids, everything's moving on.

476
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,320
 I don't like what the situation is in front of me.

477
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,140
 Abraham found himself in very similar circumstances.

478
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,220
 And sadly, he didn't walk by the faith

479
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,420
 that marked his original relationship,

480
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,260
 and beginning relationship with God.

481
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,900
 And so, we're gonna talk about some of those,

482
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,820
 about what it looks like to trust him in your situation.

483
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,280
 Our second idea, this comes from Genesis 16.

484
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,920
 I'm gonna summarize the story,

485
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,540
 so that we can keep moving through.

486
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,700
 But basically, what happens,

487
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,960
 Abraham continues to wait for a child.

488
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,940
 God says, hey, I'm gonna bring you a little baby boy.

489
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,520
 That's what's coming for you, Abe.

490
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,220
 You and your girl, Sarah, you're about to have a kid.

491
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,400
 Just get excited, make up the nursery.

492
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,260
 And Abraham's waiting and waiting and waiting.

493
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,900
 10 years go by, there's no kid.

494
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,980
 He looks over at his wife, Sarah, who's 75,

495
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,940
 and he's going, gosh, this woman is not having a baby.

496
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,180
 She is not the baby mama.

497
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,640
 This cannot work out.

498
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,060
 The biological clock is not ticking anymore.

499
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,420
 The clock fell off the wall,

500
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,540
 and Sarah's not having this baby.

501
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,380
 And Sarah's going, I'm not having that baby.

502
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,740
 I mean, think about it, 75.

503
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,020
 Who do you know who's 75?

504
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,860
 And if you're like, yeah,

505
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
 but biblical ages are different, aren't they?

506
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,660
 The Bible says about Abraham and Sarah,

507
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,100
 they were as good as dead, how old they were.

508
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,480
 That's how it describes it.

509
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,460
 So Abraham's looking, Sarah's going,

510
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,660
 it's not coming for me.

511
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,780
 And they look, and one day, they see this servant

512
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,180
 that was a part of their household named Hagar.

513
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,840
 And they say, hey, why don't you go sleep with Hagar

514
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,720
 and Abraham, and maybe she can bring the child.

515
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,960
 Maybe that's what God wants to do,

516
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,040
 that Abraham begins to take things into his own hands.

517
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,760
 And he takes things into his own hands,

518
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,680
 and they go sleep with Hagar, and what do you know?

519
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,360
 God brings into the world a little baby boy,

520
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,600
 but God shows up and says,

521
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,680
 this is not the child of the promise.

522
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,880
 This child, I will bless,

523
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,380
 and he will have nations come from him,

524
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,820
 but this will not be the child

525
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,720
 that I choose to bless the whole world through.

526
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,280
 His name was Ishmael.

527
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,760
 Ishmael, if you know the story of Ishmael,

528
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,120
 there was all kinds of conflict

529
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,220
 because Abraham said,

530
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,620
 I'm gonna just take things into my own hands.

531
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,680
 I don't know if God's way is really gonna work out,

532
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,480
 so I'm just gonna kind of make things work.

533
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,580
 Because of that decision,

534
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,600
 all kinds of chaos was brought into Abraham's family.

535
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,560
 Conflict began to mark their family.

536
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,040
 There was a feud, and eventually,

537
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,560
 Ishmael and his mom were separated

538
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,900
 from the rest of the family,

539
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,080
 and to this day, a conflict exists

540
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,720
 between the two sons of Abraham.

541
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
 Because Ishmael, and Ishmael,

542
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,960
 and if you know the story of the Arab nations,

543
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,200
 they trace their line to Ishmael.

544
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,280
 Is there a conflict today

545
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,160
 between the Arab nations and the Jews?

546
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
 Yes.

547
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,560
 This will be on CNN.

548
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,960
 Click it on, you'll see something about the Middle East.

549
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
 That's what we call that.

550
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,960
 That's what the conflict between the Arab nation

551
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,900
 and the Jew, all of which started here,

552
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,340
 and his desire to take things into his own hands.

553
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,260
 He brought consequences, not just for him and his family,

554
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,100
 consequences we still see the effects of today.

555
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,900
 This is the person who brings things into their own hands

556
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,100
 'cause they don't trust God,

557
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,020
 and they bring chaos into the world as well.

558
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,620
 Like, this is the person, truly,

559
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,780
 this is the girl who says, like,

560
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,480
 look, I know, I'm dating this guy,

561
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,900
 and he's really not a believer,

562
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,220
 but I'm working with him, we're gonna get there.

563
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,580
 I feel like I'm a light in his world.

564
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,120
 I feel like I'm a good example for him.

565
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,200
 I've seen Fixer Upper.

566
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,280
 I know how this thing works.

567
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,300
 He's my little Fixer Upper.

568
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
 We're gonna make it work.

569
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,780
 And this is the person who ends up

570
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,220
 pursuing that relationship, thinking like,

571
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,920
 hey, I need to be the vessel which God uses to save him.

572
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,780
 Ends up going farther in that relationship,

573
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,280
 sometimes even gets married,

574
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,200
 and brings all kinds of pain into their life,

575
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
 the pain that comes from marrying someone

576
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,680
 who doesn't share the same faith as you.

577
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,720
 This is the person who says, like,

578
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,540
 look, I'm gonna take things into my own hands.

579
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,880
 I'm in an unhappy marriage.

580
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
 I'm getting a divorce.

581
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,800
 I mean, God wants me to be happy, right?

582
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
 That's what God wants for us.

583
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,460
 And they say, I'm just gonna get a divorce,

584
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,540
 and all kinds of pain is brought into their life.

585
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,640
 The person, tragically, who takes

586
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,440
 and taking things into their own hands,

587
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,800
 rather than trusting God with whatever situation

588
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,800
 is in front of them, ends up taking the life of a child.

589
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,760
 Ends up saying, hey, I'm going to abort this child

590
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,080
 because, man, God would not want this child

591
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,400
 to be raised in a home like this.

592
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,320
 Could be crazy.

593
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
 And if you're in the room, and that's part of your story,

594
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,780
 any of those things, man, there is so much grace.

595
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,720
 God can redeem, restore any story, any story.

596
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,380
 One of my closest friends, partners in ministry,

597
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,160
 is a girl named Allie, who that's a part of her story.

598
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,600
 And she is a testimony to just how God can redeem

599
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,420
 and work no matter how bleak.

600
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,960
 But at the same time, she would acknowledge

601
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,280
 there's incredible pain.

602
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,720
 When we grab and take things into our own hands,

603
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,040
 and take them out of God's.

604
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,840
 And so Abraham modeled this,

605
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,520
 and not only did he have a lapse of faith there,

606
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,760
 there's another time where God shows up,

607
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,720
 and basically, shortly after this, he says,

608
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,600
 look, I'm going to give you a child.

609
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,720
 And Abraham's response, he literally laughs

610
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,640
 in the face of God.

611
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,920
 I'm gonna read it, and it's almost comical.

612
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,880
 This is what happens a little bit later.

613
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,080
 God shows up, and he says, hey, Abraham,

614
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,640
 I know you still don't have a child,

615
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,680
 and it's been 25 years.

616
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,120
 Think about that.

617
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,400
 God promises you something,

618
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,440
 you're expecting something from him, 25 years.

619
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,880
 If we don't get a prayer request that we pray on Thursday,

620
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,000
 answered by like Sunday, we're like,

621
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,760
 where are you, God, where are you?

622
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,520
 Abraham, 25 years.

623
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,120
 He's still waiting, and God shows up,

624
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,840
 and gosh, I love this part, because it's so like crazy.

625
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
 He says this, verse five of chapter 17, next chapter.

626
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
 No longer, Abraham, God shows up,

627
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,280
 hey, does he show up with a little child?

628
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,360
 No, I'm showing up with a name change.

629
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,680
 I want you to change your name.

630
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,080
 What am I gonna go by, God?

631
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,160
 You will be called Abraham,

632
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,480
 for I have made you the father of many nations.

633
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,000
 I will make you very fruitful.

634
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,040
 I will make nations and kings come from you.

635
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,720
 Wait a second, God, I don't even have one king,

636
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,000
 or one child, let alone a nation.

637
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,080
 Can I just get one?

638
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,960
 Not only do I want you to change your name,

639
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,280
 we're gonna change Sarai's name, your wife.

640
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,000
 She's gonna be the mother of many nations.

641
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And as for Sarai, you are no longer to call her Sarai.

642
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,560
 Her name will be Sarah.

643
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,840
 I will bless her and give her a son by you.

644
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,800
 I will bless her so she will be the mother of nations.

645
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,000
 Like, imagine this conversation

646
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
 when he gets home to his wife.

647
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,600
 So God showed up today, and apparently,

648
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,520
 I'm supposed to stop going by Abraham,

649
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
 and start going by father of many nations.

650
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,040
 I'm Big Papa, and you are Big Mama from now on.

651
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,120
 (audience laughing)

652
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,840
 And think about it, I mean, he doesn't have a kid,

653
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,160
 he's gotta go around the neighborhood

654
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,680
 when people are like, hey, Abe,

655
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,520
 you mind if I borrow, you know, camel?

656
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,440
 I don't know what they borrow.

657
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
 Hey, Abe, you mind if I borrow?

658
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,240
 And he's like, actually, you call me father of many nations.

659
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,480
 Okay, Abe, you don't even have a kid.

660
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
 It's father of many nations, first off.

661
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,360
 Like, think about this, for an entire year,

662
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,320
 change your name to father of nations.

663
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,600
 That is crazy.

664
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,960
 And God, in the midst of this, says,

665
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,120
 hey, I'm inviting you because I've said it.

666
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,720
 You can take it to the bank.

667
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,880
 It's as good as done.

668
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,520
 You are a father of many nations

669
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,880
 because it's going to happen.

670
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,920
 That's how sure of a thing that it is,

671
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,400
 and I want you to call yourself that.

672
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,840
 Here's what Abraham does.

673
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,720
 In the midst of being told this would happen,

674
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,640
 he doesn't do what I think a lot of us look at the Bible

675
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,080
 and we're like, man, what a faithful patriarch

676
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,940
 who must have said, yes, Lord, you have spoken,

677
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,780
 and so it shall be.

678
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,840
 Here's what he does.

679
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,000
 Abraham fell on his face and laughed.

680
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,800
 He laughed at God, saying,

681
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,560
 will a son be born to a man 100 years old?

682
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,560
 Will Sarah bear a child at age 90?

683
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,600
 And Abraham said to God,

684
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,240
 if only Ishmael could have your blessing,

685
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,240
 then God said, yes, but your wife, Sarah,

686
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
 will bear you a son.

687
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,980
 You will call him Isaac.

688
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,160
 I have made my covenant with him.

689
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,720
 I will establish it with him

690
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,200
 as an everlasting covenant for his descendants.

691
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,560
 Time goes by, and God, despite Abraham laughing in his face,

692
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,580
 despite the waves of not trusting him in his situation,

693
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,640
 despite his faithlessness, God is faithful to the promise,

694
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,180
 and a little baby boy shows up.

695
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,020
 Sarah gets a bump in her stomach,

696
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,360
 and nine months later, Isaac gets brought into the world.

697
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,080
 And I wanna pause really quickly here

698
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,540
 before we go to the last part of the story.

699
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,420
 I think this was the pivot point in Abraham's life.

700
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,240
 I think this was the moment when he began to go,

701
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,080
 oh my gosh, God, whatever you say is going to happen.

702
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,000
 I trust you.

703
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,680
 I think because we're told later on

704
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,920
 that Abraham's faith grew, that on the journey with God,

705
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,760
 he grew strong in his faith as he saw God continue to work.

706
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,880
 And I think, and why do I think that?

707
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,140
 Mainly because what would you do if you were Abraham

708
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,880
 and you saw a 90-year-old woman give birth to a baby?

709
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,680
 For us, we're like, oh man, that's crazy.

710
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,260
 That's so biblical crazy.

711
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,220
 Think about your grandma.

712
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,360
 My grandma's 93.

713
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,920
 Girl ain't having no babies anytime soon.

714
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,400
 You got any grandmas around?

715
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,760
 No children coming through that.

716
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,080
 Abraham watches.

717
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,800
 (congregation laughing)

718
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,640
 I apologize.

719
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,600
 And by that, I mean a woman, her.

720
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,940
 (congregation laughing)

721
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,880
 We're gonna just move on.

722
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
 (laughing)

723
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,520
 We're just closing prayer after that, Lord.

724
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,760
 It's true.

725
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,680
 It's true.

726
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,040
 (congregation laughing)

727
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,120
 Oh man, okay.

728
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,760
 Oh man.

729
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
 So anyway, all right.

730
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,400
 So Abraham sees this, but it did happen there.

731
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
 Abraham sees it happen in his own life.

732
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,480
 He sees God show up.

733
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,680
 He sees God deliver and keep his promise.

734
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,960
 And let me bring us back.

735
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,280
 I think it was in this moment that he began,

736
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
 his faith grew strong.

737
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,960
 No matter what God says will happen,

738
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,120
 if he says it, it's true.

739
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,420
 It's going to happen.

740
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,320
 And I say that not only because of how amazing it would be

741
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,160
 if we saw it firsthand,

742
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,000
 but because of what happens next in Abraham's life.

743
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,040
 And this man who both expressed faith at times

744
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,640
 and then had these moments and waves

745
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,960
 where he didn't trust God,

746
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,480
 all of a sudden does what I think is unimaginable

747
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,300
 in terms of faith.

748
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,440
 Shows an amount of faith,

749
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,460
 I don't even know how to get my arms around fully.

750
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,180
 And God comes to him and says one more thing.

751
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
 So the baby is here.

752
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,020
 Isaac is here.

753
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,320
 God's kept his promise.

754
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,000
 Abraham's been waiting 25 years.

755
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,760
 Finally, a little baby boy is here.

756
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,160
 Finally, a child that God has promised will live,

757
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,480
 that God has promised Isaac will be the one

758
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,620
 that my covenant never ends through.

759
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,160
 Isaac will be the one, this little baby boy,

760
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,680
 he's going to be the one who will bring about

761
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,300
 really the savior of the world.

762
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,740
 Jesus would come through Isaac.

763
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,400
 So Abraham's sleeping well knowing,

764
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,040
 "Hey, I know God has promised."

765
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,560
 And just like he promised and it was fulfilled

766
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,720
 in a 90-year-old woman, this child will live.

767
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,000
 This child will bring into the world the savior.

768
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,880
 Until all of a sudden one day, God shows up to Abraham

769
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,240
 and he begins to test Abraham's faith.

770
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,200
 His final exam, if you will, of faith

771
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,080
 in their relationship.

772
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
 And here's what God invites all of us to.

773
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,460
 He's about to show how he calls Abraham

774
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,800
 to a place I think he calls and wants all of us to live at.

775
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,400
 But it's a place of trusting God,

776
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,720
 this is our third point, with no reservation.

777
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,760
 That he's gonna trust God.

778
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
 "I'm not holding anything back, God.

779
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,680
 "I'm gonna trust you with anything and everything."

780
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,540
 And here's what happens next in Abraham's story.

781
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,260
 So the little boy begins to grow

782
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,220
 and this is what happens.

783
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,500
 Sometime later, this is chapter 22,

784
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,100
 God tested Abraham.

785
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,860
 And he said, "Abraham," and Abraham said, "Here I am."

786
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,820
 And then God said, "Take your son,

787
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,700
 "your only son whom you love,"

788
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,080
 or your one and only son you may have, Isaac,

789
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,240
 "and go to the region of Moriah, go to Mount Moriah,

790
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,300
 "and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering

791
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,640
 "on a mountain that I will show you."

792
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,680
 Child sacrifice?

793
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,900
 Like God, what is it?

794
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,840
 You want me to sacrifice the child?

795
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,340
 What are you asking me to do?

796
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,380
 I mean, I've been waiting years and years and years

797
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,540
 for this child and finally he's here

798
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,820
 and you're saying, "Go and I want you to sacrifice him."

799
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,420
 What are you asking me to do?

800
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:11,680
 But Abraham, I think this is why I believe

801
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,060
 that his faith had grown strong,

802
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,940
 that he knew no matter what God's asking me to,

803
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,780
 I can trust him.

804
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,900
 I know that he's a good, loving father.

805
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,620
 He wouldn't call me to do something

806
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,340
 that went against his will, his good and perfect will,

807
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,700
 so I'm gonna trust him.

808
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,460
 We're told later in the book of Hebrews

809
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,180
 that Abraham in this moment believed and trusted

810
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,260
 that even if he sacrificed his son,

811
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,860
 God could raise him from the dead.

812
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,460
 He knew that this child must live

813
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,340
 and so even if God's asking me to kill this child

814
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,660
 and just wait for it,

815
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,020
 'cause you can feel the tension of the story,

816
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,420
 even if God's asking me

817
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,300
 that he can even raise him from the dead,

818
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,820
 there's nothing impossible for him, so I'm gonna go

819
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,220
 and I don't know what he's gonna do,

820
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,700
 but I'm not holding back.

821
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,520
 I'm gonna trust him without reservation.

822
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,380
 Whatever he calls me to, I'm putting it in your hands, God.

823
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,260
 And Abraham goes and he goes to Mount Moriah

824
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,660
 early the next morning and I just,

825
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,100
 the mixture of emotions he must have felt

826
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,540
 as he gets on a donkey with his son who he's going to kill.

827
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,700
 Early the next morning, Abraham got up

828
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,540
 and loaded the donkey.

829
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,380
 He took two of his servants and his son Isaac

830
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,020
 and when he had cut the wood for the burnt offering,

831
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,300
 they set out for the place God had told him about.

832
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,180
 On the third day, Abraham looked up

833
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,780
 and saw the place in the distance.

834
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,740
 Three days, three nights,

835
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,860
 camping underneath the same stars that God said,

836
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,140
 this son, Isaac, will be the one

837
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,940
 through whom more than the stars you could count will come.

838
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,620
 Where could God be going with this?

839
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,100
 And he said to the servants when they arrived at the mountain

840
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,400
 stay here with the donkey.

841
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,260
 So God says, I want you to go to this mountain

842
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,660
 and build an altar, sacrifice him here.

843
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,260
 At the bottom of the mountain, Abraham says,

844
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,140
 hey, servants, you guys stay here.

845
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,460
 I love what he says next.

846
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,860
 While I and the boy go over there,

847
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,860
 we will worship and then we will come back to you.

848
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,440
 I don't know what's about to happen.

849
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,180
 I don't know what's gonna happen up on that altar,

850
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,020
 but I know this, at the end of the day, I can trust God.

851
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,900
 I know even if he has to raise my son from the dead,

852
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,940
 we will come back to you.

853
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,500
 This is the child of the promise

854
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,380
 and I can't fully understand how God could be asking me

855
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,020
 to do this right now, but I know I can trust him.

856
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,820
 I'm gonna continue to walk with him.

857
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,160
 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering.

858
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,580
 He placed it on his son, Isaac.

859
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,580
 He carried the fire, the torch, and the knife.

860
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,700
 As the two of them went on together, Isaac said,

861
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,020
 father, yes, my son, the fire and the wood are here,

862
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,940
 but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?

863
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,660
 Abraham answered, I love this.

864
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,340
 God himself will provide the lamb

865
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,900
 for the burnt offering, my son.

866
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,500
 And the two of them went on together.

867
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,240
 When they reached the place that God had told them about,

868
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,780
 Abraham built the altar there.

869
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,700
 He arranged the wood on it.

870
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,060
 He bound his son, Isaac, and he laid him on the altar

871
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,780
 on top of the wood, and there he reached his hand

872
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,420
 and took the knife to slay his son.

873
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,700
 But the angel of the Lord called out from heaven,

874
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,500
 Abraham, Abraham, here I am, he replied.

875
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,000
 Do not lay a hand on the boy.

876
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,360
 Do not do anything to him.

877
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,760
 Now I know that you fear God.

878
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,980
 You have not withheld your only son from me.

879
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,440
 Abraham looked up, and there in the thicket,

880
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,060
 Abraham's sitting there, he was about to sacrifice his son,

881
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,900
 and God says, don't touch the child.

882
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,460
 I'll provide a sacrifice.

883
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,860
 And he looks up, and he doesn't see a lamb.

884
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,660
 He sees a ram caught in the thicket inside of the wood.

885
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,300
 Miraculously, all of a sudden, an animal has appeared

886
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,980
 right before them to be the sacrifice God provided.

887
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,220
 He went over and he took the ram

888
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,680
 and he sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.

889
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,820
 So God called that place, or Abraham called that place,

890
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,020
 the Lord will provide.

891
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,180
 To this day, it is said, on the mountain of the Lord,

892
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,180
 it will be provided.

893
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:07,020
 That Abraham, despite waiting years and years,

894
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,420
 said, I'm going to trust you.

895
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,780
 I'm going to even place the life of my son.

896
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,580
 And this is what I mean by, I don't know

897
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,660
 that I have enough faith to do what Abraham did.

898
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,560
 I think there's things in my life I know that there are,

899
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,260
 my son included, where I would go,

900
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,900
 God, I cannot give you this.

901
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,940
 I mean, there's parts of my own life,

902
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,640
 when I think about like job and future,

903
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,380
 and even like ministry, and Annie's here,

904
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,300
 and music, make it spiritual.

905
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,140
 And I think of just like, what are you doing, God?

906
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,260
 Where I'm going, I don't know if I'll let you touch this.

907
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,380
 I don't want you to touch my wife's health.

908
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,180
 And Abraham models for us where he just says,

909
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,700
 look, I'm not holding anything back, God.

910
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,740
 I'm putting all of it in your hands.

911
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,140
 I trust you.

912
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,380
 I trust you with whatever you do, God.

913
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,380
 And I think the crazy thing for me on the things

914
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,660
 that all of us, and I know you're in the room,

915
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,100
 they're holding onto things tight.

916
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,640
 When it comes down to like your singleness,

917
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,000
 you gotta, hey, take anything.

918
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
 I'm not gonna be single for the rest of my life.

919
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,240
 I will do whatever,

920
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,600
 I will get on 19 different eHarmony accounts.

921
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,160
 I am not being single, God.

922
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,600
 Do not take that from me.

923
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,680
 And I think all of us have this reluctance to God,

924
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,220
 I'm not giving you this.

925
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,280
 And I think the crazy thing is like,

926
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,840
 Abraham said, hey, I'm gonna put even my son's life

927
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,360
 in your hands, as if it's not there already.

928
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,040
 You're the only thing keeping him alive.

929
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,820
 You're the only thing that holds any chance

930
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,940
 for whatever future you have in this room.

931
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,700
 There's nothing that you're holding onto

932
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,860
 that God's not already holding onto.

933
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,300
 It's not already in his hands.

934
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,180
 And the best shot we have is to place it

935
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,140
 and surrender to him.

936
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,740
 I love the story of Isaac,

937
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,840
 and I'll close here, we'll land the plane.

938
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,020
 Because Abraham, not only did he get to see God show up

939
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,800
 in miraculous ways, he got to see something else.

940
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,660
 He got to see what the story of Isaac

941
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,460
 and really Abraham is all about.

942
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,820
 And so if you've been tuning out,

943
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,700
 tune back in right here.

944
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,860
 If you're counting these little wood things,

945
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,980
 come everybody right back here.

946
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,540
 We're gonna just look at the very purpose

947
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,260
 of the entire story of Abraham and Isaac.

948
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,020
 It was never just about the sacrifice of this son.

949
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,620
 It was about the sacrifice of a son

950
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,440
 that would come years and years later.

951
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,300
 I mean, see the parallels in the story.

952
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,300
 Take your son, your one and only son who you love.

953
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,600
 And all of us in that moment are going,

954
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,780
 God, what the heck?

955
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,980
 How can you ask him to kill his son?

956
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,640
 I'm not gonna have him kill his son

957
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,900
 because I'm killing mine.

958
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,880
 On behalf of him and Isaac and all of the human race.

959
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,160
 He's the one that will be delivered up.

960
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,100
 I mean, see the parallels on the same mountain,

961
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,060
 Mount Moriah.

962
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,620
 You know what we call Mount Moriah today?

963
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,200
 Mount Calvary.

964
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,220
 It's the exact same dirt.

965
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,180
 I'm not saying like, oh yeah,

966
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,600
 it's kind of like the same picture.

967
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,980
 Literally the same place.

968
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,940
 2000 years before Jesus, God on that mountain says,

969
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,080
 don't kill the son.

970
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,260
 I'm gonna kill mine.

971
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,520
 The whole story, Isaac carrying the wood

972
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,820
 up that mountain years later,

973
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,120
 Jesus would carry not wood for an altar,

974
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,980
 but wooden cross on his back.

975
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,020
 Because the story points to the God

976
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,320
 who steps into the world.

977
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,240
 And we ask, where are you going with this?

978
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,360
 Jesus, that's where the whole thing's been going to.

979
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,800
 That's really what the whole Old Testament,

980
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
 BC before Christ, it all points to Christ.

981
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,140
 Everything, last week we talked about Noah,

982
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,420
 the week before Adam and Eve,

983
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,300
 all of them, they're pictures of Jesus.

984
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,560
 Jesus said this in Luke 24,

985
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,880
 where he basically says, look,

986
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,200
 everything in the Old Testament,

987
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,960
 first half, all about me.

988
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,620
 This is the sequel to all of them.

989
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,560
 Jesus, they all point to him.

990
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,180
 Adam, who failed his test in the garden,

991
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,200
 Jesus passed his in the garden.

992
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,640
 Noah, a piece of wood lifted up and raised,

993
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,360
 much like a wooden cross raised,

994
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,640
 and all who trust in it will be saved.

995
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,480
 Isaac, the son who was spared, the one and only son.

996
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,800
 It's all been pointing to Jesus.

997
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,160
 Your life, everything that you're going through,

998
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
 everything in your life,

999
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,520
 God right now is trying to use to point you to Jesus,

1000
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,720
 to allow you to look at Jesus.

1001
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,640
 Abraham, Jesus says about Abraham,

1002
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,040
 and I love this part, and I promise you,

1003
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,360
 I'm laying in the plane, we are landing this plane.

1004
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,520
 Abraham, Jesus said, Abraham saw my day coming.

1005
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,560
 He looked forward to my day coming.

1006
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,320
 John 8, 56, Jesus says, he's talking to these Jews,

1007
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,960
 he says, you're sons of Abraham, right?

1008
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,160
 Abraham looked forward to my day coming.

1009
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,160
 And then it says this, and he saw it, and he was glad.

1010
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,960
 Not just, hey, he was looking forward,

1011
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,480
 he was excited this would one day come,

1012
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
 you know, he didn't exactly understand.

1013
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,520
 Abraham, distinct from the others, Abraham saw it coming.

1014
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,320
 Not only when he looked up from the thicket and saw the ram,

1015
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,120
 he saw the Lamb of God coming.

1016
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,480
 He saw what this was all about.

1017
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,300
 He saw what all of life is about,

1018
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,200
 that all of meaning on this planet,

1019
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,760
 you cannot experience meaning without knowing Jesus.

1020
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,360
 Life finds its meaning in Jesus.

1021
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,640
 Everything you're going through,

1022
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,360
 everything you being here tonight,

1023
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,480
 listen to me, please, you here tonight,

1024
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,120
 if you do not know Jesus, are in this room

1025
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,000
 because the God of the universe has woven your story

1026
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,480
 to land you here right now,

1027
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,840
 trying to point you to the King of Kings,

1028
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,720
 the Savior, who God said, spare Isaac and spare you.

1029
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,560
 I'm going to kill my son so that they can live.

1030
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,760
 That's what God is doing.

1031
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,400
 That's what everything in your life you're going through

1032
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,380
 is meant to point you to look at Jesus.

1033
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,340
 If you are a believer,

1034
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,240
 it's meant to make you look more like Jesus.

1035
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,360
 It's all about him.

1036
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,520
 It's always been about him and will always be about him.

1037
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,640
 And if you don't know him,

1038
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,020
 he sends the invitation to you, will you trust me?

1039
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,320
 Not just in a moment by moment basis on the cross

1040
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,340
 with arms spread out wide, trust in me,

1041
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,840
 not in what you do.

1042
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,640
 That's the message of the gospel.

1043
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,080
 Trust in me.

1044
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,320
 Trust that I paid for your sin.

1045
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,720
 Trust that I'm enough.

1046
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,920
 You're not a good enough person to get in.

1047
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
 You never will be.

1048
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,600
 But I'm giving you a free ticket.

1049
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,020
 Will you trust me?

1050
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,320
 The son who was slain, the lamb God provided,

1051
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,800
 and everything is meant to look towards him

1052
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
 or make you, if you know him, look more like him.

1053
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,080
 I'm gonna pray that would be the case and we'll close.

1054
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,200
 Father, thank you for the story of Abraham and Isaac

1055
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,520
 and the story of faith.

1056
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,120
 Just the example of a man who trusted you in the midst

1057
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:30,600
 of just incredible asks, go.

1058
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,360
 I'll tell you when to stop.

1059
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,960
 Trust me with even your son.

1060
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,760
 Lord, thank you that despite just his failures,

1061
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,160
 despite my failures, my moments,

1062
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,920
 I just don't trust you.

1063
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,880
 Everyday moments, you still love us.

1064
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,560
 You're patient with us.

1065
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,620
 You still died for us.

1066
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,400
 You still allow us to have a relationship with you

1067
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,560
 defined by faith.

1068
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,320
 That it's not about can you behave,

1069
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,680
 but do you believe that Jesus paid for it?

1070
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,800
 Father, we worship you now through song.

1071
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,080
 We thank you that all of life finds meaning

1072
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,600
 in knowing Jesus and seeing Jesus.

1073
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,960
 Thank you for this scandal of grace we're about to sing

1074
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,220
 where you died for us, you died in our place.

1075
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,640
 We sing and worship you through song now, amen.
