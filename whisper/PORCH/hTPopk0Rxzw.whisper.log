[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.800]   - All right, what's up everybody in the room,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.320]   everybody joining us online.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.200]   We are continuing this series, The Book of Ephesians,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.840]   and I wanna welcome PortsLive Locations Midland,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.200]   PortsLive, Boise, Scottsdale, Greater Lafayette, North Houston,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.400]   Tulsa, all of the different locations joining us
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400]   from around the country.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.400]   Let me start by telling you guys about yesterday in my life.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.760]   It was a day that I did not see coming once upon a time,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.320]   specifically when I was younger, dating my wife,
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.300]   early in marriage, sitting in rooms like this,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.720]   listening to people long ago,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440]   and it was the day when my wife and I went to go
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.060]   purchase a minivan.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.400]   And I'm gonna be honest, I didn't see this coming.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.600]   People would sit there and talk about their family
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.920]   and the minivan and we loaded them all up
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.600]   and I would sit there when I'm dating my wife
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.800]   or early in marriage and they would share that
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.920]   and I'd always be like, that's not us, babe,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460]   we are not minivan people, we are Tahoe,
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.860]   we are Tahoe people.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.960]   And then, yeah.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.900]   And then the day came and after months and months
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.760]   of my wife wanting a minivan more than anything else
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.280]   in the world and you know, just things change,
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.720]   people change, it's very practical,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   it's a very practical car, we went to go buy a minivan.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.520]   Now long story short, we went there and we got there
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.920]   and we checked it out and it didn't work out
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.120]   and so we are still on the hunt, so to speak.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.800]   But even the fact that we're in the hunt,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   just something I did not see being a part of my story
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.880]   sitting here.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.360]   But while I was at the dealership,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260]   they needed my license to do some different paperwork
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.920]   and so we gave it to them and we looked at the car
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.360]   and it just didn't make sense and we decided,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440]   hey, we're not gonna buy this one and we took off.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.360]   I get 30 minutes away from the dealership,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.000]   headed back to our house and I get a phone call
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.040]   and he says, hey, your driver's license is still here.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.920]   And so this, you know, long story short,
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.520]   just became like, oh, this is such a mess,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.600]   we just wasted three hours, now I gotta go back
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.960]   and get my driver's license
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.720]   and this little piece of identification.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.000]   Now I say all that to really lead up
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.080]   to the driver's license.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.320]   When you think about a driver's license,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.840]   it is something that doesn't determine or define
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   who you are but it describes who you are
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.960]   and it describes, in particular, a few things about you.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.560]   It determines who you are, it tells you your name.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.820]   Everybody who's got a driver's license in the room
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.660]   has their name on it.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.040]   It tells you where you live, so it tells you who,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   it tells you where, it tells you what year you were born.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   So who, where, what, tells you what height you are
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.640]   and when you were born, so who, what, where.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   And tonight, we're gonna look at a passage in scripture
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.240]   where the Apostle Paul is going to give us, so to speak,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240]   another document that defines, or sorry,
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.400]   describes who you are, where you will spend eternity.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.600]   When you will change, what you have in Christ,
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   what you need most in this life.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.040]   And he's gonna say, 'cause we're in the series,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.540]   Ephesians, Introducing the New You,
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.240]   we're gonna be at Ephesians chapter one,
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.720]   and he's gonna lay out the who, what, why, where, and when
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.040]   of your new identity in Christ.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.320]   And what I wanna answer as we walk through
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.640]   who you are in Christ, what you need most,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.640]   and when you will change, so the who, what, and when,
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.840]   is the question of where you will spend eternity
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.120]   and why you will spend it there.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.200]   Where you will spend eternity,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.560]   either with God in heaven forever
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   or in hell apart from him, and why that will be the case.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.200]   As we look at those three different questions,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.980]   and I can't think of a more important message
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.120]   that you can answer, 'cause here's the deal,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.480]   you come every week, or a lot of you guys come every week,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.640]   and people listen online, and we hope that you have,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.600]   man, an amazing career, hope you have an amazing marriage,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.140]   hope that you raise kids that love you and that you love,
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.160]   and God just blesses you in every way,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.000]   but not if you don't know Jesus,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.200]   or not at the expense of you not knowing Jesus
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.880]   and spending eternity apart from him in hell.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.560]   In other words, you can listen to our dating messages,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.020]   you can listen to how to fight anxiety,
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.220]   but if you don't know Jesus,
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.760]   if you're not gonna spend eternity with God,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.120]   that is a waste, and I wanna start tonight,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360]   and as we journey through this passage,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.280]   give as much clarity to how you can know
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.800]   where you will spend eternity
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.040]   and why you will spend it there.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.740]   And so we're gonna be at Ephesians chapter one,
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.400]   we're looking at who you are in Christ.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.860]   This follower, believer of Jesus, this is who you are.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.100]   Paul's laying out to the church in Ephesus,
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.820]   and as a reminder, if you missed last week,
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.260]   the letter Ephesians was written to the church in Ephesus,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.420]   young church that Paul loved this city,
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.860]   and Ephesus is still a town that exists today,
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.900]   you can get on a plane and you can go fly and go see it
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.460]   today and go see the beautiful port city that is Ephesus.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.400]   And this, 2,000 years ago, was a place
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.040]   that didn't look like it had boats coming through it,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.320]   it didn't look like a port would today,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.260]   but a place that the apostle Paul just loved,
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.520]   and so he writes and he launches in and says,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   "This is who you are, the new reality
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.460]   "of who you are in Christ.
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.600]   "This is what I'm praying for you,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   "'cause it's what you need more than anything else,
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   "and this is when you will change
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.120]   "and what you have access to in Christ."
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.840]   So I'm gonna start in verse three of chapter one,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.280]   it'll be up on the screens.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.560]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up there.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.880]   Additionally, if you don't have a Bible,
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.500]   we have a Bible for you, we'd love to give you as a gift
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.860]   in the Welcome Center right out here.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   So verse three, answering who you are in Christ,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.320]   the first point, and in verses three through 14,
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.480]   the apostle Paul gives the longest single run-on sentence
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.100]   in the entire Bible.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.420]   I mean, it's literally a single sentence in the Greek.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.060]   It would get butchered in your high school English class
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.220]   back in the day, but it's just him overwhelmed.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.660]   It's a little bit like, I don't know,
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.540]   like my sister, when she would tell stories,
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.380]   she would just go and go and go,
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.220]   and she was like, "And today was great,
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.060]   "and I was at school."
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.020]   And then all of a sudden, Bob came out,
[00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.220]   and Bob was like, "Oh, this is so great."
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.300]   And Bob didn't bring his lunch,
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.340]   so I was like, "Bob, you can have some of my lunch."
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.440]   And all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.460]   comes Steve, and Steve was like,
[00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.380]   "And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.140]   And Paul is just caught up in the emotion and passion
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.500]   of what God has done in Christ.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.200]   And so he just goes in, starting in verse three.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.660]   I'm gonna try to get through it in a single breath.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.720]   13 verses, here we go.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.260]   All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.820]   who has blessed you with every spiritual blessing
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.660]   in the heavenly realms,
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.560]   because we are united with Christ.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.880]   Even before he made the world,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.780]   God loved us and chose us in Christ
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.860]   to be holy without fault in his eyes.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.060]   God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family,
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.460]   bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.780]   This is what he wanted to do,
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.180]   and he gave him great pleasure.
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.020]   So we praise God for the glorious grace
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.340]   he has poured onto us, who belong to his dear son.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.300]   He is so, oh man, I didn't make it.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.620]   He's so rich in, (audience laughing)
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.980]   I feel like I'm rapping or something.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.560]   He's so rich in kindness, his grace,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.980]   that has been purchased, that has purchased our freedom
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.260]   with his blood of his son, and he forgave our sins.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.060]   He has showered his kindness on us,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.740]   along with all wisdom and understanding.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.540]   God has now revealed his mysterious plan regarding Christ,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.180]   a plan to fulfill his own good pleasure.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.660]   And this is the plan, at the right time,
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.220]   he will bring everything together
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.580]   under the authority of Christ,
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.980]   everything in heaven and on earth.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.900]   Furthermore, because we are united with Christ,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.100]   we have received an inheritance from God,
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.660]   for he chose us in advance,
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.900]   and he makes everything work according to his plan.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.660]   God's purpose was that we Jews,
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.400]   who were the first to trust in Christ,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.420]   would bring praise and glory to God.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.360]   And now you Gentiles, who have also heard the truth,
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.220]   that God saves you, and when you believed in Christ,
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.680]   he identified you as his own,
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.540]   by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.980]   The Spirit is God's guarantee
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.120]   that he will give us an inheritance he promised,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.780]   that he has purchased us to be his own people.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.860]   He did this so we would praise and glorify him.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.340]   The first question I wanna answer
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.740]   is the Apostle Paul goes through,
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.460]   he says, this is who you are.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.540]   When you trusted in Jesus, when you said,
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.420]   I'm no longer believing that my good works,
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.340]   or myself, will earn eternal life,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.540]   and get me good standing, or get me right with God.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.900]   When you put your faith in Christ
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.940]   as the payment for your sin on the cross,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.380]   his death and his resurrection as proof of that payment,
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.580]   a few things happened,
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.580]   and you receive the fact that you were chosen by God.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.420]   So who are you?
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.860]   You are chosen by God.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.540]   And he says, before the foundation of the world,
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.900]   God chose you.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.740]   Your father in heaven, and he walks through
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.420]   with the father did, the son did, and the spirit did.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.180]   He said, your father in heaven
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.400]   chose you before creation ever happened.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.860]   That there has never been a moment you have existed
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.560]   where if you are in Christ,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   you were not chosen and loved by God.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.080]   From the very first breath you ever took
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.480]   to even before that, he says,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.620]   before anything in creation, God chose you.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.620]   Says that he's blessed us in the heavenly realms,
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.700]   as in spiritual, eternal blessings,
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.900]   that we won't even fully experience or realize
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.340]   until we're in heaven.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.580]   And that he destined us for adoption, that he chose.
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.020]   The word adoption, as I've said before,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.260]   and a couple of weeks ago we talked about this,
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.980]   wasn't a word that was synonymous
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.300]   with what we think of adoption.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.180]   Adoption, in other words, when we think adoption,
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.100]   we think, oh, like a child, like a baby.
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.400]   In the Roman world, that wasn't what people thought of
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.260]   when they thought of adoption.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.820]   They thought of adopting an adult, and here's what I mean.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.500]   In other words, that's pretty bizarre.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.980]   If somebody said in your life,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.220]   hey, we're gonna adopt someone,
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.460]   and then the person that they adopted showed up
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.260]   and he was a 40-year-old man, you'd go,
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.660]   wait a second, what?
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.500]   But that's exactly what would happen over and over.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.260]   The most common form of adoption
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.340]   was a means by which you would pass on your inheritance
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.940]   to someone you selected.
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.520]   In other words, the vast majority,
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.220]   almost all of the Roman emperors,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.900]   the king of the land, was adopted,
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.560]   chosen by the emperor of the time.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.100]   Very few, only three, had any blood relationship
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.660]   with the person that came before them.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.020]   So they thought adoption was something
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.820]   where you would look and you would select,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.620]   and in that day and age, they would look and they'd select,
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.180]   hey, based on certain qualities,
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.660]   hey, you fit, and you fit,
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.580]   and no, definitely not passing it over to you,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.220]   and they would choose who would be a good fit.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   Paul says, God looked and he knew
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.440]   everything you would ever do,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.540]   every sin you'd ever commit,
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.460]   everything wrong inside of your heart and your life,
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.060]   and despite all of that, he said, I choose you.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.840]   He sees your worst moment,
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.480]   and before you ever live that out,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.600]   he sees every sin you're gonna commit in your life,
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.520]   sins you don't even know you're gonna do,
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   and 2037, on a Thursday, he saw, he sees,
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.320]   and he chose you, not because of you, in spite of you,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.440]   just because of his grace, we're gonna see in a second.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.560]   He sees your worst and says, I choose you.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.800]   It's not dissimilar to this, or similar to this.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.880]   In the past decade of doing young adult ministry,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.940]   I've gotten to do a lot of weddings,
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.140]   and something really interesting happens in that moment.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.620]   It's a day where the bride will go through
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.420]   just hours and hours of renovation process
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   in order to get ready for this moment.
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.680]   I mean, the guys are out playing golf that morning,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.100]   and then they're like, do I need to shave,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.140]   and then they're getting their suit on,
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.420]   and the girls, from Tuesday at four 'til Saturday at four,
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.020]   are just going to work.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.500]   They're busting out a tackle box
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.340]   full of makeup and painting things,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.980]   tying hair, putting hair that didn't even exist
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.860]   before attaching it, eyelashes.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.180]   I mean, they're just going full sin, spray tan,
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.660]   in the middle of December,
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.440]   looking like they've been on a beach for the last 18 months,
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.760]   and they just get so ready, and it's the moment
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.360]   where they look better than they've ever looked
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.860]   or will ever look in the rest of their life,
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.640]   and it's kind of their day.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.840]   And the guy is looking at her in her best moment
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.760]   and saying, hey, I choose you.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.700]   See, in the best moment here,
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.540]   and he's seeing her and chooses her.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.080]   In other words, I've done weddings,
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.580]   and I've never been standing next to the groom,
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.580]   and doors open, and see the groom go,
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.660]   ah, man, I don't know.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.840]   Ah. (audience laughing)
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.360]   I feel like whatever renovation happened
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.620]   is maybe less likely to choose.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.440]   He's going, man, this is the most beautiful
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.660]   I've ever seen her.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.920]   And he's choosing her at her best,
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.260]   and the scriptures say that God looked at you and I,
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.740]   and he chose us at our worst.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.260]   And he makes the decision, man, I chose you,
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.740]   and before the foundation of the world,
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.580]   before all of that, in spite of you, I chose you.
[00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.020]   And then he says, the son, and the son purchased us,
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.420]   so you are chosen in Christ.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.620]   You have been purchased.
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.020]   It's the same word for redeemed.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.860]   What's redeemed?
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.740]   Just like if you go redeem a coupon or something,
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.140]   you're exchanging it and getting something in return.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.940]   And the message of Christianity is Jesus said,
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.780]   I will give my life in return for yours.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.140]   I will take your place and die the death you deserve
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.460]   so you can have the standing and relationship with God
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.860]   that only I deserve.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.020]   Why did he do this?
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.560]   Is it because he knew you're a great person
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.620]   or you're not as bad as the other people?
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.460]   No.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:41.020]   Completely because of his riches in grace, the verse says.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.500]   That he is rich in grace.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.340]   What's that mean?
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.460]   The word grace is the word for undeserved favor.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.220]   That has nothing to do with anything
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.180]   that is deserved or merited.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.020]   And God is a God who's rich in grace.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.740]   Grace, I've tried to teach my kids,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.780]   it's not just you don't get punished.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.380]   You were speeding and you should have got a ticket.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.220]   I'm gonna let you go.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.040]   That's mercy.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.700]   Grace is you were speeding and you should have got a ticket
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.340]   and I'm gonna give you a new car.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.220]   That's what grace is.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.500]   In fact, I was trying to explain this
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   to my six-year-old at the time he was four.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.680]   And I was like, man, this is gonna be
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.220]   just a brilliant parenting move.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.340]   And so he had acted up, hit his sister or something,
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.020]   you get in a spanking, take him to the back room,
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.300]   sit in there and I'm like, hey, do you know what you did?
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.740]   And of course, after like five minutes of negotiating
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.740]   of no, okay, you hit your sister and you deserve a spanking.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.660]   But you know what you're gonna get?
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.220]   A piece of candy.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.100]   And I'm gonna take the spanking.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.820]   And I like hit myself.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.780]   Which feels a lot less weird when you're not telling it
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.220]   to a room of thousand people.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.140]   And ever since that moment, every time he gets in trouble,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.060]   I'm like, you're getting a spanking.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.120]   He's like, I want grace, I want grace, please.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.120]   Spank mommy, spank mommy.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.620]   I'm like, oh man, this message was not delivered.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:13.740]   But that's in essence in a far greater reality, real way,
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.900]   he took what we deserved and he gave us
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.440]   what we could never ever get on our own.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.700]   And he purchased us and made us adopted into his family.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.180]   And then it says the spirit of God has now sealed you
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.660]   or confirmed and guaranteed that God has made a promise
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.700]   and that good work he will bring to completion.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.460]   You didn't get yourself in based on how good you were,
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.500]   which means you can't get yourself out
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.960]   based on how bad you are.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.500]   The spirit has sealed it.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.940]   It's done, sign sealed, it will be delivered
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.440]   to God for all of eternity.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.500]   And he uses the language of the spirit.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.700]   He's now sent and begins to come into our life
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.740]   and begin to transform us and convict us.
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.640]   And it says, it's like the deposit.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.680]   What's a deposit?
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.900]   Well, when we were looking to buy that car,
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.520]   if I'm gonna buy that car, I put down a down payment
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.820]   or a deposit, which says, hey, here's some of it.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.080]   And it's a promise for more to come.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.700]   And the Bible says, man, that spirit inside of you
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.780]   is a promise from God sealing you,
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.780]   that there is more to come, eternal life to come,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.540]   transformation to come, the new you is beginning
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.320]   and it is a guaranteed sure thing.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   And now the spirit is beginning to bring about
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.200]   and transform.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.400]   Now, how do you know if you have the spirit?
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.460]   If you can't think of a time where the spirit of God
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:54.500]   and the word of God began to direct your life
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   and call you to do something that on your own,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.940]   you wouldn't wanna do, you wouldn't wanna confess that,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.840]   you wouldn't wanna share that,
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.380]   you wouldn't wanna be generous like that,
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.300]   you wouldn't wanna share your faith at work like that,
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.580]   you wouldn't wanna go back and ask for forgiveness
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.300]   like that, you wouldn't wanna say, man,
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.100]   I think I've messed up in this relationship
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.620]   and I have dishonored you and God.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.140]   If you can't think of any moment in your life
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.420]   where you decided to do something,
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.660]   not because it felt right or you wanted to,
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.060]   but because you knew and felt like the spirit
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.900]   was convicting you or moving you to,
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.300]   then you may not have the spirit of God.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.860]   'Cause the Bible says all who are led by the spirit of God
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.460]   are children of God, Romans chapter eight,
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.760]   that he begins to come and he doesn't bring perfection
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.820]   overnight and none of us are and all of us
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.420]   are in need of a savior, but he begins to just bring about
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.660]   in our life and things that used to just be,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.500]   man, this is normal and I do whatever I want,
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.860]   all of a sudden, it's like he just begins to move in
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.740]   and bring transformation.
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.820]   Now, the most challenging part of that whole passage
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.580]   is like, wait, he just said you chose, God chose me,
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.300]   wait, I thought I chose God whenever I trusted in him.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.960]   Did he choose me or did I choose him?
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.900]   Yes.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.520]   In other words, this is a tension the Bible presents
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.080]   of God wants every person on the planet to know him
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.960]   and yet he knows in advance every person
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.260]   that will accept him.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.080]   And in a way that none of us will be able
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.480]   to fully understand, there is free will
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.460]   and yet God is sovereign and he has chosen
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.400]   and has known you if you are in Christ
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.480]   from the foundation of the world.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.400]   Now, if you're going, wait, but I'm not a believer,
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   what about my family, how do I know if he's chosen them?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.740]   You don't, but you know that he has chosen people
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.380]   everywhere, which moves us to share the gospel with people
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.440]   'cause there are people out there who are going
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.900]   to make that decision, they're going to accept Jesus.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.860]   Not a motivation against it, it's a motivation for it.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.280]   And if you're in the room and maybe you're like,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.040]   man, I don't even know where I stand on all this,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.860]   could I suggest that maybe even the fact
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.020]   that you're here right now is a reflection
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.500]   of the fact that God is after you,
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.760]   not to rip you off, but because he's a God who loves you,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.880]   gave his life for you, wants you to experience
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.360]   good things inside of life.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.200]   And you're in a church on a Tuesday night at eight o'clock,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.240]   you could be at some happy hour.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.440]   And could it be that God is pursuing you?
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:21.360]   'Cause he wants you to be among those who are chosen.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.600]   So Paul launches in, you can just see the passion,
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.480]   I just see Paul just going off 'cause he's so excited
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.580]   about what God has done, sealing and giving security
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.620]   for the rest of their life, and then he launches
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.940]   in verse 15 into a prayer, and in that prayer,
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.220]   he asks for something really interesting for them.
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.780]   He says, I'm praying for you guys, and here's what he says.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.060]   Ever since I heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.780]   and your love for God's people everywhere,
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.980]   I've not stopped thanking God for you.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.300]   I pray for you constantly, asking God,
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.280]   the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.400]   and here's what I'm asking him,
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.440]   to give you spiritual wisdom and insight
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.720]   so that you might grow in your knowledge of God.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.600]   I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.840]   so that you can understand the confident hope
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.400]   he's given us to those who he has called,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.760]   his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.880]   So Paul launches in, and the first thing that he prays
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.540]   is say, I'm praying to God, praying about you guys
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.460]   constantly, woken in the morning, thinking about you,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.020]   here's what I prayed.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.040]   Going to bed at night, thinking about you guys,
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.100]   here's what I prayed.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.520]   And what he prayed specifically is,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   God, will you give them spiritual wisdom and insight
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.140]   so that they might grow in their knowledge of God?
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.500]   Now, when you read the Bible, you're like,
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.360]   man, that's so poetic and it's so beautiful,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.000]   but it's kind of a funny thing to pray.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.980]   In other words, with everything that got going on in life,
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.260]   with all the different ways that life was difficult
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.820]   and challenges they were facing,
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.260]   why would you choose that, Paul?
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.420]   When you think about your life,
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.900]   instead of a room like this, you don't pick any one of us,
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.620]   and you think about all the different challenges
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.940]   that are faced, the job that you didn't get
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.620]   or you did get or the boss you don't like
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.700]   or the dating relationship that you're not sure
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.820]   is gonna make it or even should or is even on the radar,
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.940]   and all the different things that are difficult
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.880]   in your life, and let's say one of the friends
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.900]   around you, tomorrow morning, they send you a text
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.020]   and they just said, hey, just want you to know
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.620]   I'm praying for you, and I'm praying
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.020]   that God would give you spiritual wisdom
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.700]   and insight into the knowledge of God.
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.660]   You would go, what?
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.460]   What does that even mean?
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.980]   You'd probably hit the like button,
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.300]   and you know, not sure I understand.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.260]   They'd say, I'm not either, just read it this morning
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.100]   in Ephesians, what is he saying?
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.640]   Well, it's pretty profound, basically he's saying,
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.440]   I'm praying that God would give you
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.820]   a greater understanding and knowledge of him.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:04.060]   I'm praying that you would know God more.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.400]   The second question I wanna answer
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.560]   is something that Paul is asking God for
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.880]   'cause he knows that above everything else I could pray,
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.480]   the thing that you need, Ephesians,
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.840]   and you need, David, and you need, fill in the blank,
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.380]   more than anything else in life, is to know God more,
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.700]   to know who he is, who you are in light of that,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.460]   what he has promised you in Christ, what you have,
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.180]   and he's saying, hey, what do you need most?
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.980]   The thing that you and every person out here,
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.420]   and you're not gonna think of it this way
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.660]   and have probably never even articulated it this way,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.900]   but he's saying, you know what?
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.660]   Of all the things I could ask God for,
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.740]   the promotion, car, house, prosperity
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.600]   and financial blessing in your life,
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.700]   marriage, kids, I'm praying that you would know God more
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:57.860]   and that you would have a deeper understanding
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.460]   of who he is, his love for you,
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.300]   his control in the world around you,
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.020]   and that you would have a death grip
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.480]   on the hope you have in heaven.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.880]   The hope we have in Christ,
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.180]   and he says the confident hope,
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:21.420]   because he's telling them, no matter what you face in life,
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.100]   because you're in Christ, you have a confident hope,
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.580]   you know who wins.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.140]   I'm praying that God would allow you to know him more
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.460]   and to know the depths of the hope that you have,
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.380]   'cause no matter what you face in life,
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.500]   no matter if you die in the next four months,
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.420]   four minutes, or 40 years,
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.300]   you can rest with a confidence you know who wins
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.340]   and how this thing ends,
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.760]   and you know where you're gonna spend eternity,
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.400]   forever and ever and ever,
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.520]   and I'm praying that that would become a reality
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   in your life, 'cause the more that becomes a reality
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.040]   of man, I just know, no matter what I face,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.480]   I know how this ends, I know my God wins,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.240]   it'll change your moments.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.800]   Why do I say that?
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.680]   From time to time, I'll record a sports game
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.160]   when I'm at like, you know, tonight,
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.680]   or I'm out doing something or speaking somewhere,
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.120]   and I can't watch in a person, so I do what we all do,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.620]   just record it so that I can go watch it later,
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.960]   and I will do my best to go, if it's the Mavs,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.700]   or it's whoever, if I'm around people,
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.140]   hey, don't tell me the score, don't tell me the score,
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.500]   just wanna go watch the game,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.300]   and I'll show up and just volunteer, hey, good to see you,
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.900]   hey, if you've seen the Mavs, Aggies, whatever,
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.980]   don't tell me the score, okay?
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.700]   Inevitably, though, somebody ends up being like,
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:36.900]   oh my gosh, did you see Luka?
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.500]   He just went off in that quarter,
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.020]   I cannot believe we're advancing,
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.560]   and you're like, ah, so I go watch the game,
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.800]   and now I'm watching it in an entirely different way
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.240]   'cause I know what happens, and so whatever,
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.160]   you know, there's a fumble on the opposite side of the game,
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.460]   the team that I want not to win,
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.460]   but I know is gonna lose anyways,
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.960]   I'm like, it's all right, I know who wins, or girls.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.480]   I've lost everybody with the sports thing,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.920]   imagine The Bachelor, and you know who he picks at the end,
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.780]   or the girl, or whichever one,
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.060]   and you're like, oh no, they had a fight,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.940]   but I know that he ends up with her,
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.780]   so it's all gonna be fine, I mean, it's the exact same thing,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.620]   and Paul is saying, hey, when you know what is coming,
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.540]   what's ahead, who wins, it allows you,
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.260]   when things don't go how you wish that they would,
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.260]   to go, I know how this ends, and I have hope,
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.500]   and Paul is saying, man, I am praying
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.020]   he would deepen his knowledge,
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.140]   your understanding of who he is,
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.900]   and the hope that you have in Christ.
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.160]   And that you would know how loved you are.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.000]   Verse 18, he says, he calls the people of God,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   God's holy people, his rich and glorious inheritance.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.680]   Now he just said, God's inheritance is you.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.360]   That's a funny thing.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.600]   Why do I say that?
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.120]   Inheritance is something, it's a reward,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   it's something you get, it's something that,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.720]   eventually, you're going to receive.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.000]   And God, who owns and controls everything,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.520]   created everything, everything has been made by and for,
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.100]   looked at you, and despite having all of that,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.880]   says, that is my great inheritance.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.240]   I mean, it's like, what do you give Elon Musk,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.840]   or Bill Gates, who own so much,
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.320]   and could buy anything for themselves,
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.080]   what do you give them at Christmas?
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.840]   I mean, truly, it's like, man, you could buy,
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.520]   here's some socks, and if you wear them,
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.960]   the socks are gonna go through the roof,
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.440]   and we'll be quadrillionaires, 'cause they have everything.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.120]   And yet, despite the fact, God,
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.160]   there's not a single inch on the planet,
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.940]   or in the universe, that is not his.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.920]   Bible just said, man, you are his chosen possession,
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.440]   his inheritance.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.040]   That there's never been a moment
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.520]   you have not been loved, wanted, chosen by God.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.200]   But the deepest thing is, Paul is saying,
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.800]   oh man, I'm praying for you to know that,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.160]   and for you to know him,
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.560]   for you to have a deeper understanding of him,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.080]   above anything else he could give you,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   I'm asking him to give you that.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.880]   When 10 years ago this month,
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.560]   or a couple months ago, 10 years ago,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.000]   my wife and I got engaged, and whenever you get engaged,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.080]   you get to go through what's called the wedding registry,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.800]   which I've just shared before,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.700]   it's like the greatest thing ever,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.640]   because it's the only time in your life
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.160]   you get to go around and pick out a bunch of gifts,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.960]   and then in a way that society accepts,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.200]   send out paperwork to people going,
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.720]   hey, we know you're gonna get us gifts,
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.480]   if you do, we'd like it to be one of these, okay?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.620]   And so you just go around and you get to register,
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.820]   and pick out at Bed, Bath, and Beyond,
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.160]   or wherever, Crate and Barrel,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.680]   all the different things you want people to buy you.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.020]   And that's awesome.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.120]   What is a far greater gift in marriage
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.900]   than the toaster and the spatula is the spouse?
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.760]   And it would be insane for if you were catching up
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.400]   with a friend who'd recently gotten married,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.640]   and you were like, man, how is it?
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.400]   And they were like, it's unbelievable.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.600]   I gotta show you this toaster.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.960]   We got four lanes here for four pieces of bread,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.000]   and let me show you the spatula over here.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.960]   And you're like, no, but how's marriage?
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.080]   I just told you.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.160]   You wanna see the bread?
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.560]   You'd be like, well, but how's your wife?
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.280]   I actually haven't seen her in a while.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.520]   Let's go back to the spatula.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.280]   You'd be like, you have missed the forest for the trees.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.920]   You are obsessed with the things and the gifts
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.640]   that came with it, not the person, the relationship.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.040]   That's essentially what Paul's saying.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.280]   And candidly, the older I get,
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.920]   the more that I just walk with Jesus,
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.040]   and I see men in my life, and I see women in my life
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.640]   who just continue to walk with Jesus,
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.400]   this shift begins to happen,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.960]   where it's not that God's against stuff,
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.680]   or having a car, or having nice things,
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.160]   or having a house, or whatever it is,
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.800]   but more than he wants you to know any of that,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.920]   or have any of that, he wants you to know him.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.680]   And more and more, I just see people who,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.880]   man, they may even drive the car,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.280]   they may even have the house, but it's like, man,
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.040]   all that's fine,
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.600]   but not if it gets in the way of me knowing Jesus.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.900]   I mean, there's plenty of people on the planet
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.480]   that have everything that you would want in life,
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.840]   but they don't know Jesus, and they're miserable,
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.400]   and sadly, they're going to hell if that stays the case.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.520]   And Paul is saying, more than anything else,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.380]   what will endure longer than anything
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.920]   that God could bring into your life
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.840]   is gonna be a relationship with him,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.400]   and I'm asking that he would give you more of that.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.480]   And then he finally answers the question of when we change,
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.400]   and it's inside of the prayer,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.840]   and he brings something else up, and here's what he says.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.000]   "I also pray that you will understand
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.200]   "the incredible greatness of God's power
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.720]   "for us who believe him,
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.060]   "the same power that God has towards us and works in us,
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:11.280]   "the same power that raised Christ from the dead
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.080]   "and seated him in the place of honor
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.600]   "at God's right hand in the heavenly realms.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.520]   "And now he's far above any ruler or authority
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.000]   "or power or leader or anything else,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.640]   "not only in this world, but in the one to come.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.480]   "God put all things under his authority.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.040]   "He made him head over all things
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.480]   "for the sake of the church, and the church is his body.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.520]   "It is made full and complete by Christ
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.640]   "who fills all things everywhere with himself."
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.960]   That Paul just said, hey, I'm praying
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.720]   that you have an understanding
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:45.760]   of the access you have to the power of God in your life.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.320]   The answer to the question of when you will change
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.480]   is when the power of God becomes something
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.320]   that you begin to surrender to and let work in your life.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.600]   'Cause here's what he just said.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   The same power that raised Christ's dead,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.720]   bleeding, bled out body, and brought life back into it
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.040]   is now at work in those of us who believe.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.740]   And he brings up there is resurrection power
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.600]   that you and I have access to in Jesus.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.840]   And this is how people change.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.120]   This is how Christians change.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.960]   It's not that they come in and they hear a bunch of rules
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.720]   and they're told you need to do something different
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   or you need to act a certain different way
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.800]   and they just walk out of here
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.960]   and bootstrap and try harder.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.800]   No, the power of God comes into the life
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.640]   and begins to transform them
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.720]   and do what the resurrection power of God does.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.160]   It takes dead things and brings life into them.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.800]   And there's no greater force or power in existence.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.200]   I mean, you think about God creating the world,
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.040]   everything in a moment with a word.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.320]   That's impressive.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:51.080]   But creation power is creating something from nothing.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   Resurrection power is God creating something alive
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.680]   from something dead.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.720]   He doesn't just have the ability
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.560]   to make something beautiful out of nothing.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.240]   He has the ability to make something beautiful
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.720]   out of something bad.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.240]   And this is where as Christians,
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   we have to have an understanding of how you change.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.120]   It's not you deciding on your own.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.960]   You know what?
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.780]   I can do it.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.080]   I've got what it takes.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.320]   It's by surrendering and walking and accessing.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.680]   I'm dependent on you, God.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.960]   Apart from you, there's no power in my life.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.240]   There's no power in your life.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.440]   You don't have the ability to conquer anxiety.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.960]   You don't have the ability to conquer depression.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.400]   If you did, you would have done it already.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.000]   You think you have a match for lust,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.120]   the pornography you've had for a decade?
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.480]   And could it be that maybe you think the problem is,
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.160]   man, I just need to try harder and work harder.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.920]   And Paul is saying,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:53.500]   "There's no power in you all by yourself,
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.000]   but you have access to the resurrecting power of God
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.280]   that takes dead and broken, messed up things,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.160]   and he brings life into them."
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.400]   And I wanna answer the question as we close here in a second
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.840]   of how you and I do that
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.440]   and how Christians experience that change.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.440]   But it's not by deciding,
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.940]   man, I'm just gonna work harder.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.960]   It is by accessing the resurrection.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.280]   This is why people and how people
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.760]   begin to experience change.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.720]   This is why people make the decision,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.700]   man, I'm walking in step with the Spirit.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.640]   I'm walking in step with God.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.080]   I need to forgive my father.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.480]   I never thought I could.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.120]   After all the pain, all the hurt, all the abuse,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.660]   and I need to forgive him.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.000]   It's how people, like I've already shared even my own story
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.560]   of pornography for years,
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.400]   and God, through the Spirit of God and the Word of God
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.800]   and people of God moves you to go,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.280]   man, God, I'm totally dependent on you.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.760]   If this is gonna be anything I experience victory in,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.880]   it's gonna be not by my strength or my might,
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.320]   but by you and by you alone.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.480]   And so God, I am surrendering.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.120]   I'm walking in step with you, your Word, your people.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.760]   And God begins to bring change.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.280]   And let me answer the question, how does that happen?
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.640]   Two weeks ago, I was in California.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.080]   My family went with my wife's family.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.920]   We were on a beach.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.840]   It was amazing.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.680]   It was beautiful.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   And I was up one morning
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.780]   and I was watching out in the distance the Pacific Ocean.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.880]   And this sailboat was sailing by.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.200]   And I was watching it.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.720]   And a few minutes later, I went in and just grabbed coffee
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.360]   and I came back out and it was completely still.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.880]   This thing that had been moving at a significant pace
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.760]   was all of a sudden just stopped in the water.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.360]   And the sail was down.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.560]   Sailboat can't move without the sail being up
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.360]   and the wind pushing it in a specific direction.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.600]   Apart from that, it is incapable of moving
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.560]   in any direction all on its own.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.320]   Or it is entirely at the whim of the waves around it.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.520]   And this is the Christian life.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.320]   The Christian life is that you and I are incapable
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.840]   of becoming more and more like Jesus.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.640]   We are incapable of being and living the new you.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.680]   And our role, just like a sailboat, is to spread the sail.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.520]   What does that look like?
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.600]   It means, God, I am surrendered to you.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.720]   I am trusting in you.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.360]   I am incapable on my own of having the type
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.320]   of dating relationships that you call me to.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.640]   I can't, but you can.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.800]   And so I'm inviting you in.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.880]   God, I am trusting you.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.480]   I am opening my life and saying,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.120]   God, you direct it wherever you will.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.320]   I am surrendered to you.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.440]   And when you begin to do that,
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:31.500]   it's like the spirit of God fills the sail of your soul
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.760]   and he begins to direct and he begins to guide.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.160]   But it doesn't happen on your own,
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.800]   but it happens in story after story
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.760]   of people sitting around you who have experienced
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.480]   the power of God in their life.
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.200]   The same power that raised Christ from the dead.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.520]   Working in their life and bringing and healing
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   all the different places that you think,
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.920]   man, that's too far.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.960]   And Paul would say, you have access
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.480]   to the most powerful thing that has ever existed.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.600]   And the spirit of God inside of your life.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.200]   And that's when you would change.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.600]   So where will you spend eternity?
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.920]   Well, it comes back to the why.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.520]   How do you put your faith and trust in Jesus
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.560]   as the payment for your sin?
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.700]   'Cause if so, you are chosen, you are forgiven,
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.120]   you are sealed, you were purchased.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.880]   And the greatest thing any of us need in this life
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.760]   is more of God.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.440]   And the way that we experience change in our life
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.120]   is not by trying harder or by doing more things.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.680]   It is by, God, I am dependent and surrendered to you.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.320]   You bring change.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.000]   I'm opening the sail of my life and you direct.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.200]   And I trust you.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.000]   And that person will spend eternity with God in heaven,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.440]   not because of anything they've done,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:50.440]   but because of Christ, because they are the new creation.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.600]   And that same extension is offered by God to you tonight.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.040]   And just the last thing I would say,
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.320]   man, if you've never made that decision,
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.040]   tonight is your night.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.800]   And God, he's not angry at you, he's crazy about you.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.000]   He gave his life for you
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   so that you could experience a new life in him.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.000]   Let me pray.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Father, I thank you that you are at work in our lives.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.040]   I thank you for the ways you are bringing resurrection power
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:24.960]   and taking areas of our soul and our life and ourself
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.040]   that are dead and you're bringing life.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.540]   And so would you help us, God, to be surrendered,
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:33.040]   to be open to you, to be led by you,
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.240]   to walk just dependent on you.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.520]   God, we can't change ourself.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.080]   We can't conquer anything,
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:45.520]   but you can conquer everything.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.760]   And so God, we ask for your help
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.480]   to walk in dependence on you.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.960]   I pray for anyone who has never trusted in you tonight
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.200]   that would change.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.280]   And in their heart and where they're sitting
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.160]   or in the moments that we're having ahead,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.000]   that they would come to a place
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.200]   where they realize and accept that
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.120]   they are chosen.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.960]   They are loved.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.040]   They have been purchased by Jesus's life
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.240]   and they are sealed.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.200]   And that is a deposit of what is to come.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.280]   We worship you now in song.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.120]   Amen.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   We worship you now in song. Amen.
