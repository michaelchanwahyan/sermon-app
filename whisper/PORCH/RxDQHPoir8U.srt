1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 I mean, he's practically dating a model.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,680
 She told me they went to Cabo, and he paid for the whole thing.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,120
 Dude, she does his laundry and cooks.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,400
 He proposed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,960
 Bro, she plays in his fantasy football league

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,160
 and knows more about the Cowboys than he does.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,520
 She's got the husband, the house.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,920
 She's got it all.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,200
 What more could you ask for?

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,880
 How are we this evening?

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,120
 Come on.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 Well, we're so glad you're here.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,360
 I grew up on a farm in a small town in South Texas,

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,800
 so about 20 acres in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,480
 And we had this big shed.

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,280
 We called it the big garage.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,840
 And as I was a child and loved to play outside and be outside

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
 and whatnot, the big garage was just full of toys.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,200
 And by toys, I mean like shovels and rakes and farming

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
 equipment, that kind of thing.

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
 And there was this thing in there

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,200
 that I didn't know exactly what it was,

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,280
 but it instantly became a toy of mine, if you will,

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
 because it kind of looked like a gun.

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,160
 And so it would make this clicking noise.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,880
 And so I would get it, and I would kind of

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 go around the yard and pretend like I was shooting things.

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,480
 And if a friend came over, I would give him one,

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,080
 and I'd have one.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,440
 And we would play kind of armies.

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,800
 I think I've got a picture of it.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,520
 There it is.

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,600
 OK, so that's it.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
 And so that was this thing in the garage.

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,160
 And so I would get it and play with it.

36
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,080
 And so that's your kind of imagination runs.

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,880
 And so you ever see something, you're like,

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,360
 I wonder what that's for.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,880
 And so for me, I'm like, man, I wonder what that's for.

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,320
 And so one day, I'm out with my dad,

41
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,120
 and we're doing cowboy farming kind of stuff,

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,800
 and not my kind of stuff, but his kind of stuff.

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,720
 And so we're out there.

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,960
 We're feeding the cows.

45
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,040
 And we stop by this fence that's broken.

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,440
 And he gets out that thing.

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,480
 And I'm like, dad, it's a weird time to play army man.

48
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
 What are you doing?

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,720
 And he hooks it up to the fence.

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,040
 And he begins repairing the fence.

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,240
 And so this is another picture of what it is.

52
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
 And so that's what it's for.

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,400
 And I remember having this moment--

54
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,680
 this is why I tell you this weird story.

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,320
 I remember having this moment that's like, oh,

56
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
 that's what that's for.

57
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
 Like, I had no idea.

58
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,520
 I would have never in a million years

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,560
 been able to fill in the blank the right way.

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,720
 It was like, oh, yeah, does that ever happen to you?

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,480
 Oh, that's what that's for.

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
 Or like, you're doing something with something.

63
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
 And you're like, that's not what that's for.

64
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,720
 I'll go one more with you, because you guys

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,240
 didn't seem to jump on board with the fence stretcher.

66
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,000
 So let me go here.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,880
 My son Weston comes in--

68
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,840
 about a year ago, he comes in the room.

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,240
 And he's wearing Monica's bra on his head.

70
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,040
 And he's like, earmuffs.

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,800
 And I'm like, no, that's not what that's for.

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,880
 And I can't even show you what that's for, OK?

73
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,960
 So we'll just talk about it.

74
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,000
 So it's like there's something that serves a purpose.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,720
 And you think that it serves a very different purpose.

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,240
 And the reason I start there as we wrap up relationship goals

77
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,760
 is because tonight, I hope that happens three times.

78
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,200
 I hope three times tonight you go, oh, that's what that's for.

79
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,120
 I thought that it was just a toy for my amusement.

80
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,260
 I thought that it was just something for me

81
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,040
 to engage my emotions on.

82
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,480
 I thought that it was just a good time.

83
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,840
 Oh, that's what that's for.

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,320
 As we talk about singleness, being single,

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,200
 dating, and marriage, I hope three times tonight you go,

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,760
 oh, that's what that's for.

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,360
 We have to return to the purpose of these things--

88
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,840
 being single, dating, and marriage.

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,080
 Because God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

90
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,960
 the one who formed you in your mother's womb,

91
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,480
 the one who created all things as we know it and see it

92
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,400
 and live in it, has a purpose for singleness,

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,320
 and dating, and marriage.

94
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,440
 And you would be infinitely better pursuing

95
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,640
 his purpose than your own purpose, or the world's

96
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,600
 purpose, or culture's purpose.

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,980
 Because you've got to understand we're not getting better

98
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,360
 at this.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,600
 So the divorce rate right now is about 50%,

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
 depending on what stat you read.

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,740
 Somewhere it's hovering around 50%.

102
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,520
 That means about half of marriages fail miserably.

103
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,640
 Half of people who says, I--

104
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,240
 for richer or poorer in sickness and health

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,400
 until death do us part, part before death.

106
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,080
 About 50%.

107
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,160
 And we're not getting better at this.

108
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
 In fact, somebody after a couple weeks ago called in.

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,880
 They wanted to talk to David.

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,840
 They were upset.

111
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,500
 Said they wouldn't be back to the porch

112
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,440
 because we talked about this idea of cohabitating,

113
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,020
 living together before you're married.

114
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,840
 Said I'm committed to it.

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,800
 Well, let me share with you why a loving pastor would

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
 tell you not to.

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,200
 I'll give you some stats.

118
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,660
 Greater than 60% of cohabitating couples who live together

119
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,140
 do not get married.

120
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,260
 Greater than 75% of cohabitating couples who get married

121
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,140
 get a divorce.

122
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,820
 What that means is 10 out of 100 couples

123
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,420
 who cohabitated before marriage actually stay married.

124
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,140
 10 out of 100.

125
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,460
 And so a loving pastor and a loving God

126
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,740
 would say you would be crazy to stack the odds against you

127
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,100
 by doing-- and we said, well, no.

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,740
 Isn't it going to be a better marriage?

129
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,500
 No, statistically, absolutely not.

130
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,540
 And when we talk about a divorce rate of like 50%,

131
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,100
 for example, that does not account for those

132
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,260
 who are miserably married.

133
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,220
 So a successful marriage rate is much lower than 50%.

134
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,600
 We're not getting better at this.

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,380
 We're getting married later.

136
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,940
 On average, seven years later than in the 1960s.

137
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,140
 Just a generation ago.

138
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,820
 We're getting married seven years later.

139
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,500
 What happens 50 years from now?

140
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,740
 Seven years later and 50 years from there?

141
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,140
 Seven years later?

142
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,100
 Pretty soon we're getting married past the age

143
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,580
 that people can have children.

144
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,100
 Did you know that nearly half of girls

145
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,460
 who have children in their 20s are unmarried?

146
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,500
 We're not getting better at this.

147
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,220
 Seems like we've got to return to the purpose.

148
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,340
 But what about if we do it God's way?

149
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,340
 Another stat for you, Protestant Christian couples

150
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,500
 actively involved in their faith are 35% less likely to divorce.

151
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,180
 35% less likely to divorce than the general population.

152
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,460
 93%, that's 93 out of 100 couples who independently

153
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,660
 said that God is at the center of their marriage,

154
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,700
 rated their marriage happy or very happy.

155
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,140
 See, it seems to me that we forgot that we were created

156
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,900
 by God for God to serve a purpose for God.

157
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,220
 And if you had a Bible on a deserted island

158
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,060
 and you began reading it and you said,

159
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,340
 you know, I think this is kind of like God

160
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,420
 has some things for me.

161
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,420
 I want to understand how he wants me to date and pursue

162
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,220
 relationships.

163
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,220
 He's a relational God.

164
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,460
 So I'm just going to read this like I'm

165
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,780
 reading it for the first time.

166
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,780
 I think that you're going to walk away

167
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,620
 from that time on that deserted island

168
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,500
 with a very different worldview of marriage, dating,

169
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,380
 and singleness.

170
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,900
 I think you're going to say, oh, that's what that's for.

171
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,300
 I need to do that really, really different than I'm

172
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,500
 doing that right now.

173
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,100
 And so tonight, as we wind down relationship goals,

174
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,700
 we're going to talk about the purpose of singleness,

175
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,380
 the purpose of marriage, and the purpose of dating

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,260
 and how it is very, very different than what you thought

177
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,420
 when you came in this evening.

178
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,540
 And so I want to show you that singleness is not

179
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,060
 what you think, that dating is not what you think.

180
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,700
 And before you leave here this evening,

181
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,580
 that marriage is very different than what you think.

182
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,140
 Monica and I do premarried couples, premarried counseling.

183
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,780
 And so I've been in ministry for a decade now.

184
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,260
 I've done about 40 weddings.

185
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,020
 And by the grace of God, all 40 of those couples

186
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,220
 are still married today.

187
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,620
 And as we talk to them, all 40 of them,

188
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,980
 as they sat in our living room, all 40 of them,

189
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,940
 without exception, have had crazy expectations

190
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,820
 around marriages, marriage that we've had to correct.

191
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,980
 And they've all come back and said, man, you were so right.

192
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,580
 We had these rose-colored glasses.

193
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,380
 We had no idea what this would be like.

194
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,780
 And so I want to help you this evening.

195
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,260
 We're going to be in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,

196
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,100
 if you want to turn there.

197
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,540
 1 Corinthians chapter seven, written by the apostle Paul

198
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,540
 to the church in Corinth about 56 AD.

199
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,140
 The church is under great persecution.

200
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,100
 He's using language like, hey, Jesus is returning soon.

201
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,060
 You don't have long.

202
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,260
 There's a sense of urgency to this letter.

203
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,060
 Nero is about to show up on the scene, the emperor Nero,

204
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,420
 and he is about to persecute Christians for sport.

205
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,020
 He'll stitch animal skin to them, unleash dogs on them

206
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,760
 so they can be ripped apart for the amusement of others.

207
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,940
 And Paul writes to this church saying,

208
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,580
 hey, get ready, troubles are coming,

209
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,180
 and you need to understand,

210
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,700
 you need to have a right perspective about singleness.

211
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,760
 And he's going to talk about the betrothal period,

212
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,100
 which is being engaged, which is the closest we have

213
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,340
 to dating in the scriptures and marriage.

214
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,260
 You need to have a right perspective of these.

215
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,300
 Very applicable for them then,

216
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,940
 very applicable for us tonight,

217
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,500
 because we are moving in a culture facing persecution

218
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
 for being a Christian.

219
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,900
 Christian values, a biblical worldview,

220
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,820
 is increasingly unpopular.

221
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,060
 So this is a very applicable chapter for us this evening.

222
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,240
 One of the longest chapters in the letter,

223
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,260
 Paul's first letter to the Corinthians,

224
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,900
 and it's written specifically about marital status.

225
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,100
 Should I keep it, change it, or not worry about it?

226
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,420
 He writes this in verse 28.

227
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,020
 But if you do marry, you have not sinned.

228
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,020
 And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned.

229
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,860
 But those who marry will face many troubles in this life,

230
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,940
 and I want to spare you of this.

231
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,780
 What does he say?

232
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,100
 Wait, those who marry will have lots of sex.

233
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,940
 Wait, what is he?

234
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,460
 He wants to tell us something about,

235
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,800
 those who marry will have troubles.

236
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,020
 In fact, this is the only marital guarantee in the Bible.

237
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,020
 Those who marry will face troubles.

238
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,380
 Okay, Paul, what else?

239
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,980
 Verse 32, I would like you to be free from concern,

240
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,360
 literally translated anxieties.

241
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,140
 I would like you to be free from these worries.

242
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,900
 An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs,

243
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,540
 how he can please the Lord.

244
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,060
 Speaking to single people.

245
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,420
 Single people are concerned about the Lord's affairs.

246
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,140
 They live to please the Lord,

247
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,260
 but a married man is concerned about the affairs

248
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,620
 of this world, how he can please his wife,

249
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,300
 and his interests are divided.

250
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,460
 An unmarried woman or virgin,

251
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,500
 it's interesting that he just uses that synonymously.

252
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,460
 Virgin would be like fiance or engaged.

253
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,880
 And when he talks about an unmarried woman,

254
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,620
 he just assumes in the scriptures,

255
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,780
 writing to the church, that she's a virgin.

256
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,540
 I don't say that out of condemnation,

257
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,780
 but just to teach the text

258
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,240
 so that you would have an understanding of it.

259
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,260
 A virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.

260
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,740
 Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord

261
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,940
 in both body and spirit.

262
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,540
 But a married woman is concerned

263
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,140
 about the affairs of this world,

264
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,500
 how she can please her husband.

265
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,540
 And so a summary of that passage would be,

266
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,140
 with marriage comes new worries.

267
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,360
 So you think you're anxious today,

268
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,140
 imagine when you add someone else into the picture

269
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,420
 and you are suddenly anxious,

270
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,540
 not just about what you're going to do,

271
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,780
 where you're going to work,

272
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,140
 how you're going to eat,

273
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,980
 or anything, what you're going to drive,

274
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,060
 but now you're worried about what they're going to drive,

275
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,620
 where y'all are going to live,

276
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,220
 what you're going to do,

277
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,640
 and your worries double in that situation.

278
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,740
 You're concerned about how you will please your spouse,

279
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,400
 but the concerns, listen closely,

280
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,980
 the concerns of a single person should be

281
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,500
 how to please the Lord.

282
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,420
 And so I want to talk about with you

283
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,580
 that singleness is not what you think.

284
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,020
 Singleness is not what you think.

285
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,620
 In fact, the apostle Paul calls it a gift

286
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,260
 in the same chapter in verse seven.

287
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,700
 He says, "I wish that all of you were as I am,

288
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,980
 "but each of you has your own gift from God.

289
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,180
 "One has this gift, another has that."

290
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,060
 When he says, "I wish all of you were as I am,"

291
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,480
 he's talking about his Facebook status of single.

292
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,140
 And he says, "It's a gift."

293
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,780
 And you think, well, if it's a gift,

294
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,620
 does it come with a receipt?

295
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,700
 Can I return this gift?

296
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,060
 Or it's like a white elephant gift that no one wants.

297
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,900
 You know, you're quickly trying to pass it around.

298
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,260
 He says, "No, you don't understand.

299
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,540
 "It's a gift, it's useful."

300
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,300
 It's not just something that you play with.

301
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,540
 It's not just something that you squander.

302
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,460
 It actually serves a purpose.

303
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,860
 God, in his sovereignty, has you with this status

304
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,860
 this evening so that you would do something incredible,

305
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,220
 that you would use your life to change the world

306
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,960
 for the cause of Jesus Christ.

307
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,200
 Wow.

308
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,580
 He calls it a gift because it's used for something.

309
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,160
 We think, listen, we think that singleness

310
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,280
 is a time to live our lives, to see the world,

311
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,280
 to sow our wild oats, to make mistakes, to party,

312
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
 and we've got it all wrong.

313
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,360
 Like, if you're like, "Hey, I'm not ready

314
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,500
 "to get married yet because I still wanna have some fun."

315
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,280
 You have a misunderstanding of marriage.

316
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,480
 Then you have a misunderstanding of singleness.

317
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:11,700
 He says it's the time to do rich ministry,

318
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,460
 that that's where life is found.

319
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:21,660
 Have you guys ever heard of, like, single for a season,

320
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,780
 single for a reason?

321
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,920
 You ever heard of that?

322
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,880
 Single for a, how do I know if I'm single for a season

323
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,640
 or single for a reason?

324
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,080
 Need truth tellers, you know?

325
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,200
 How do you know if you have the gift of singleness?

326
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,040
 I'm gonna tell you right now.

327
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,220
 Like, I can tell you without a doubt

328
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,720
 if you have the gift of singleness right now.

329
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,000
 You ready?

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,360
 You're about to find out right now.

331
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,520
 What I'm about to say next is going to identify you

332
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,920
 as gift of singleness or not, so get ready.

333
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,760
 You ready?

334
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,640
 If this morning,

335
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,840
 when you woke up, true story, I'm telling you,

336
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,920
 about to be unveiled.

337
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,060
 If when you woke up this morning, you were single,

338
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,680
 you have the gift of singleness.

339
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,500
 So you have a misunderstanding

340
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,840
 that it's this chronic terminal illness, right?

341
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,960
 Like, this is this thing that you can't get rid of.

342
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,480
 No, singleness is a gift for today.

343
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,960
 I don't know about tomorrow or next week

344
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,160
 or two months from now, but if this morning,

345
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,980
 if you entered that room, this room single,

346
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,720
 you today have the gift of singleness.

347
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,600
 That's the gift Paul's talking about.

348
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
 It's not this calling on your life

349
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
 that you can't get rid of, that you're cursed, okay,

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,960
 that God gave you this desire that will never be fulfilled

351
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,880
 and so you're angry at God.

352
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,860
 You don't have to think that way.

353
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,700
 God's a good God.

354
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,400
 He gives you good things.

355
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,680
 And so if what you have doesn't seem good to you,

356
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
 you don't understand it.

357
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,060
 He's given you a good gift that you may be misusing,

358
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,540
 that you may be misunderstanding.

359
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,700
 It's not chronic.

360
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,800
 It's not terminal.

361
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,000
 It's not a disease.

362
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
 It's a gift.

363
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,500
 And if you don't see it as a gift to be used for God,

364
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,380
 then you don't see it the way God does.

365
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,380
 In fact, the Greek word is charisma.

366
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,160
 It's the gift of God's grace or God's grace to you.

367
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,700
 So how do you know if you're single for a reason?

368
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,000
 You need truth tellers in your life.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
 No, I'm just kidding.

370
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,280
 How do you know if you're single for a reason?

371
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,560
 You are single for a reason.

372
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,900
 That reason is to build the kingdom of God.

373
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,320
 It's to serve God with everything.

374
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,160
 You will never, ever, ever be more uninhibited,

375
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,040
 more available, more ready to serve God

376
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,400
 than you are right now.

377
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,700
 That is what the apostle Paul is saying here

378
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
 and it is still very, very true in 2016.

379
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,520
 You can wake up this morning

380
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,320
 and you can just get in God's word

381
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
 with no one to distract you, no one.

382
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,020
 And you're like, you don't know my roommate.

383
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,840
 No, you don't know my roommates.

384
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,380
 'Cause he's four and he gets up before me.

385
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,040
 If I get up at five, he gets up at four.

386
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,200
 And he's ready and he's ready to fight me for waffles

387
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,040
 or whatever that is.

388
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,860
 And it's a dream.

389
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,480
 If I wanna get in God's word, I've gotta leave the house.

390
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,520
 I don't know about you.

391
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,840
 You can back up that alarm.

392
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,320
 You wanna spend two hours in God's word,

393
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,400
 you just back up that alarm, two hours.

394
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
 No one to distract you, no one to say,

395
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,720
 hey, where you going, what are you doing, why are you up?

396
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,920
 (congregation laughing)

397
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
 Right?

398
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
 Just be like, I mean, it's not personal,

399
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,120
 but I'm just saying, you can get in God's word

400
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,000
 without distraction.

401
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,120
 It's unbelievable.

402
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,580
 You can go to the gym.

403
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,240
 You can put in the porch podcast.

404
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
 You can be listening.

405
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,520
 You can be, you know, being moved in a sermon.

406
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,800
 No one's texting you saying, hey, where are you at?

407
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,640
 You gonna be home for dinner?

408
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,460
 Can you run by the store?

409
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,560
 Can you grab this?

410
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,520
 What time are you gonna be home?

411
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,480
 Hey, we're sitting at the table waiting on you.

412
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,440
 And some of you are like, oh, but I just want that so bad.

413
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,400
 That's because you're missing out

414
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,720
 on the season that you're in,

415
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,120
 wanting to be in a future season.

416
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,800
 Like what you have is second best.

417
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,280
 It's a misunderstanding.

418
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
 You have a misunderstanding.

419
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,640
 You can go, like you can live,

420
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,800
 like let me just hit this on,

421
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 you can live right now on less than $20,000 a year

422
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,640
 and give away piles and piles of money.

423
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,760
 You can do incredible things and start businesses

424
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,440
 and, you know, change children's lives.

425
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,480
 I mean, if you make 60,000,

426
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,140
 you literally could give away $40,000 a year.

427
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,160
 You're like, no, you can't.

428
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,920
 I know people who do, okay, in Dallas, Fort Worth,

429
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,360
 Houston, wherever you're at.

430
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,240
 You can.

431
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,160
 You may not, but you can.

432
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,260
 You have one mouth to feed.

433
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,840
 I have five mouths to feed.

434
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,080
 I had to pay for 15 meals today.

435
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,400
 Oh, is that just hitting home?

436
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
 Some of you are like, oh, just do the math.

437
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
 [congregation laughing]

438
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,240
 Just do the math.

439
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,920
 Three meals a day 'cause I'm a loving dad.

440
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,220
 I let him eat three times.

441
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,660
 Pretty incredible, I know, I'm a giver.

442
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,760
 Yeah, 15 meals today and 15 meals tomorrow

443
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,320
 and 15 meals the next day.

444
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,880
 And so if you're like, where does this money go?

445
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
 That's where it goes.

446
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,680
 They eat a lot.

447
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,000
 You can go on international discipleship trips.

448
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,960
 If you wanna go to Africa, you can be there next week.

449
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,300
 You wanna go to Brazil, you wanna go to Haiti.

450
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,920
 Man, I remember when I came into the faith,

451
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,440
 like it was so amazing.

452
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,480
 When I was a non-believer, I was like,

453
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,760
 man, I'm gonna travel the world, but I didn't.

454
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,440
 I just kept going back to the bar.

455
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,120
 Sin robs you of creativity.

456
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,360
 But then when I became a Christian,

457
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
 I mean, I went, like as soon as I became a Christian,

458
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,240
 I went to Africa, went on a safari,

459
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,580
 a photo safari in Africa, literally had the opportunity

460
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,560
 to teach the government in Africa

461
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,360
 on conflict resolution, it was incredible.

462
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,660
 I went to the Amazon multiple times,

463
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,920
 got on a boat, traveled days down the Amazon River

464
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,060
 to get off in villages to engage people

465
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,680
 for the sake of the gospel, it was incredible.

466
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,520
 Went to the island nation of Haiti.

467
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,440
 I got to do ministry in the mountains of Haiti,

468
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,320
 ministry in the urban ghetto of Haiti,

469
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,480
 ministry in rural areas of Haiti.

470
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,800
 Incredible.

471
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,280
 And since our family has been growing,

472
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,760
 I haven't done any of those things

473
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,680
 'cause I have a divided interest.

474
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,200
 With one exception, I went to Haiti, we went for a week.

475
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,040
 I showed up for three days, that's what I,

476
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,600
 I had to get back for like a soccer game

477
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,160
 or a parent-teacher conference or something, right?

478
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,240
 Divided interest.

479
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,700
 What are you doing with your singleness right now?

480
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,000
 Are you using it according to what

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,220
 the apostle Paul is saying?

482
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,320
 Like some of you, you're enjoying your singleness too much,

483
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,360
 like you don't want the responsibility of marriage,

484
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,460
 but candidly, you don't want

485
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,640
 the responsibilities of singleness.

486
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,440
 And it's not like you think like,

487
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,900
 oh, but if I serve the Lord, I can't have fun.

488
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,060
 No, what you're doing is not nearly as fun

489
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,200
 as serving the Lord because serving the Lord is your purpose.

490
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,160
 It's why you have breath in your lungs,

491
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
 why your heart beats in your chest.

492
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,540
 You're missing out every single day on your purpose.

493
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,160
 Singleness is for you to concern yourself

494
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,120
 with the things of the Lord.

495
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,760
 And so however hard you pursued God today

496
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,120
 is indicative of how you're going to pursue him

497
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,540
 in a season that's much more difficult.

498
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,800
 It is never going to get easier than it was today.

499
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,600
 And you think, well, this is the apostle Paul,

500
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,000
 and I've read that something crazy's happened

501
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,260
 in 1 Corinthians 7, and I don't know how this,

502
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,180
 no, Jesus said the same thing.

503
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,340
 In Matthew 19, Jesus is talking about marriage,

504
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,720
 and he's like, marriage is permanent,

505
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,560
 and the disciples are like, marriage is permanent.

506
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,120
 Then we should just stay single.

507
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
 And Jesus says this in verse 12.

508
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,720
 There are some, there are those who choose

509
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,940
 to live like eunuchs.

510
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,780
 What's a eunuch?

511
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,240
 A eunuch is a unique person.

512
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,240
 No, a eunuch is a person without reproductive organs.

513
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,600
 So there are those who live like those

514
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,020
 who are committed to celibacy

515
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,120
 for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

516
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,600
 And the one who can accept this should accept it.

517
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,820
 Jesus said, Jesus said, marriage is permanent,

518
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,780
 and singleness is for the sake of the kingdom.

519
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,940
 It's over and over, this idea.

520
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,980
 And so you're here, and you're like,

521
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,820
 but JP, I want to be complete one day.

522
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,140
 You're not incomplete, okay?

523
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,480
 Was the apostle Paul incomplete?

524
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,540
 Was he not a complete person?

525
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,700
 He wasn't married, in case you didn't know.

526
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,460
 Do you know who else wasn't married?

527
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,280
 I'll give you a hint.

528
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,220
 About 33 years of age, single.

529
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,980
 Jesus, God, the most complete person

530
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,140
 that has ever walked the face of the planet,

531
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,300
 stayed, remained, died, single,

532
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,780
 and his life was more complete

533
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,660
 than any of us ours ever will be.

534
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,280
 But I can tell you lots of people.

535
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,260
 There's the Olympian-turned-missionary Eric Liddell.

536
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,400
 There's C.S. Lewis.

537
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,380
 Maybe you've read his books.

538
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,980
 They were written when he was a single person.

539
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,340
 He had time to write

540
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,940
 those incredible, creative masterpieces.

541
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,060
 You can think about whose life here

542
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,420
 is more full than that of Mother Teresa's,

543
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,180
 or Amy Carmichael, who built orphanages.

544
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,420
 She was a missionary to India.

545
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,340
 She founded a mission.

546
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,180
 She wrote books.

547
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,640
 Corrie ten Boom, who helped protect Jews

548
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,780
 from the Nazi army.

549
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,740
 She used her singleness in these ways.

550
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,860
 You can think about Katie Davies.

551
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,380
 When she was a single person,

552
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,340
 she took in 13 girls in Uganda.

553
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,260
 She was a mother to 13 girls as a single woman.

554
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,580
 These are people who used their singleness.

555
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,040
 Dietrich Bonhoeffer, when he wanted to fight

556
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,340
 the Nazi regime, he wanted to build an army of theologians.

557
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,740
 And he had a criteria.

558
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,540
 You must be single.

559
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,900
 An undivided heart.

560
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,420
 'Cause we're about to do work,

561
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,620
 and I'm gonna teach you the word.

562
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,700
 How you doing at using your singleness?

563
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,940
 Listen, singleness is not a disease you caught.

564
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,780
 It's a gift.

565
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,780
 Listen, it's not a waiting room.

566
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,080
 Singleness is not a waiting room for some future season.

567
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,680
 It's not second best.

568
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,220
 It's not JV and you're just waiting for varsity to happen.

569
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,380
 That is bad theology.

570
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,640
 The purpose of being single, here's my point.

571
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,520
 The purpose of being single is serving the Lord.

572
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,300
 Plain and simple.

573
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,420
 And so you gotta ask yourself,

574
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,900
 are you okay if 20 years from now,

575
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,620
 your lot in life is you're a really great aunt

576
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,900
 to your sister's children?

577
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,800
 And you disciple some and you love some,

578
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,700
 and you're gonna live a full life of caring for others,

579
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,300
 and you're gonna die and you're gonna go home

580
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,100
 and be with Jesus forever and ever and ever and ever,

581
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,260
 and never ask yourself, why was I just an aunt?

582
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,860
 'Cause you weren't just an aunt.

583
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,580
 You were God's grace to some children.

584
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,100
 I will tell you, the desire for marriage

585
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,300
 does not guarantee it, you need to know that.

586
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,380
 Having a desire for marriage does not guarantee,

587
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,780
 you may leave here and be hit with a meteor

588
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,980
 before you get to your car, okay?

589
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,000
 I don't know what's gonna happen to you.

590
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,020
 I don't know how this goes.

591
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,060
 You're like, did he say meteor?

592
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,500
 Yes, I did.

593
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,340
 I don't know what's gonna happen to you.

594
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,420
 But the desire does not guarantee it.

595
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,100
 You don't lose if you remain single,

596
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,000
 you lose if you waste your singleness.

597
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,940
 So let's talk about dating, how it's not what you think.

598
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,020
 Verse 35, I am saying this for your own good,

599
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,660
 not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way

600
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,540
 in undivided devotion to the Lord.

601
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,360
 There's a theme.

602
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,660
 If anyone is worried that he might not be acting

603
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,420
 honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to,

604
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,460
 and if his passions are too strong

605
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,380
 and he feels he ought to marry,

606
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,340
 as he should do as he wants.

607
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,340
 I think what Paul's doing here is actually speaking

608
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,300
 to the father of a bride and giving him his advice.

609
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,640
 Hey, if you're worried that they might not be

610
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,740
 acting honorably, if he may not be acting honorably

611
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,240
 to your daughter, it's okay if they get married.

612
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,360
 He is not sinning, they should get married.

613
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,180
 But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind,

614
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,940
 who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will

615
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,060
 and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin,

616
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,280
 the reason it says virgin is just a word then for fiance.

617
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,060
 Okay?

618
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,300
 That's why you can just think of that as interchangeable.

619
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,660
 This man also does the right thing.

620
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,220
 So then he who marries the virgin does right,

621
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,140
 he who does not marry her does better.

622
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,940
 Who would say that singleness is better than marriage?

623
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,980
 The apostle Paul.

624
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,940
 The apostle Paul would.

625
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,980
 But we don't believe him.

626
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,100
 And so he's giving advice here and he's saying

627
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,400
 if they wanna get married they can.

628
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
 But they're engaged, Paul.

629
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,540
 Like of course they wanna get married.

630
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,480
 He put a ring on it.

631
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,140
 Like they wanna get married, right Paul?

632
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,520
 And he's saying something really key here

633
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
 that we have to understand.

634
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,320
 He's saying they're not swept up in emotions.

635
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,540
 That this was not the way that we date today,

636
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
 that we give our heart to somebody,

637
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,780
 that we're completely already swept up

638
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,420
 in that current heading somewhere.

639
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,800
 He's just talking about this really pragmatic decision.

640
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,140
 Hey, I know that they're engaged.

641
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,460
 If they wanna get married they can,

642
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,160
 if they don't, they don't have to.

643
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,100
 Why would they be engaged, Paul,

644
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,140
 if they didn't wanna be married?

645
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,020
 Well, because then, you know,

646
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,240
 it was people who would love you,

647
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,320
 would come alongside you and say,

648
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,920
 hey, I think you would be really

649
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,440
 good partner to that person.

650
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,280
 Y'all should be together.

651
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
 And you would listen to them.

652
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,180
 If they were surrendered to God and wise,

653
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,520
 you would say, okay, I hear that.

654
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,380
 We can get engaged.

655
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,000
 Isn't that crazy?

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,640
 So far from where we are today.

657
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,940
 But I think there are some things

658
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,280
 that we can learn from it.

659
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,440
 First Corinthians chapter seven, verse nine,

660
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,720
 same chapter, he says this.

661
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,220
 But if they cannot control themselves,

662
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,180
 they should marry, for it is better to marry

663
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,140
 than to burn with passion.

664
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,060
 He's saying something really key here.

665
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,460
 I wanna just spell it out for you

666
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,980
 in case you've missed it through this series

667
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,860
 or if you're a first time tonight.

668
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,740
 He's saying one thing.

669
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,380
 He's saying that physical intimacy

670
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,140
 is allowed in one place and one place only in marriage.

671
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,100
 He's not saying, hey, if they burn with passion,

672
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,980
 they should masturbate.

673
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,900
 If they burn with passion, they should fornicate.

674
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,940
 If they burn with passion,

675
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,820
 they should do something else to find sexual release.

676
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,240
 He's saying that if they burn with passion,

677
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,920
 if they desire physical intimacy,

678
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,000
 well then the only place that they're gonna be able

679
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,160
 to find that is marriage.

680
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,840
 That is under God's command, marriage.

681
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,440
 You're like, well, how far is too far?

682
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,560
 When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,

683
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,960
 you've gone too far.

684
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,140
 Do I need to explain that more?

685
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,280
 No, she's like, no.

686
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,680
 Okay, good, good.

687
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,280
 I'm glad we're on the same page.

688
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,760
 Physical intimacy.

689
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,560
 And so if you're dating someone, right,

690
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,100
 you're running from that.

691
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,500
 So that may mean for you no alone time,

692
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,620
 no hanging out in the apartment,

693
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,180
 no going horizontal watching a romantic comedy.

694
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,860
 That's all foolish, man.

695
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,520
 Get married.

696
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,620
 Get married.

697
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,020
 You wanna go horizontal watching a romantic comedy,

698
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,100
 you can do it all the time when you're married.

699
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,820
 Right now, you just,

700
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,100
 well, let's talk about what you're doing.

701
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,920
 The way that we get married,

702
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,600
 the way that we move from singleness to marriage

703
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,700
 is this cultural idea of dating.

704
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,840
 And so I don't think,

705
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,860
 I wanna say that God's not trying to penalize you.

706
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,580
 He gives us these instructions for your protection.

707
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,460
 He's not a big fan of broken hearts.

708
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,440
 He's not a big fan of hurt in relationships.

709
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,780
 And so it is God's design.

710
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,580
 You may be here and you're like, well, okay, man,

711
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,980
 you have not painted marriage in a good picture.

712
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,260
 Like, I'm out on that.

713
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,220
 Why would I wanna get married?

714
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,120
 Well, the first reason is because I told you,

715
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,560
 it's the only place for physical intimacy.

716
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,120
 If you want physical intimacy,

717
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,800
 then you probably want marriage.

718
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,200
 That's God's design.

719
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,960
 The second reason is it's God's design for raising children,

720
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,480
 that they would have both a mother and a father in the home.

721
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,400
 And so if you're here and you're like,

722
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,680
 I really want children, then you probably want marriage.

723
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,840
 Marriage is God's design for children.

724
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,600
 It's not the only way to children.

725
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,120
 There are other ways to children, adoption, fostering.

726
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,120
 You can disciple children, you can be a mentor to children,

727
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,880
 but the family unit is God's design for children.

728
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,440
 And so dating is not what you think.

729
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
 It's actually a choice.

730
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,280
 To go on a date is not a commitment,

731
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,980
 but to enter into a dating relationship is a commitment.

732
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,640
 It's a commitment to find out if that person

733
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,040
 would be a good spouse or not.

734
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,880
 So we only date when we're ready for marriage,

735
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 not before that.

736
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,660
 I know that's so culturally crazy.

737
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,440
 It's so different than the way that we do that.

738
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,100
 Because the crazy thing is, is we've actually taken,

739
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,920
 listen, hear me out on this, tell me if I'm wrong,

740
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,360
 test this, try it on.

741
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,400
 We've actually taken advice from Hollywood.

742
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,720
 Hollywood has the highest divorce rate ever,

743
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,900
 anywhere on the planet.

744
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,120
 Anywhere in America, I'll say.

745
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,120
 And they're the ones who are feeding us

746
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
 this relationship advice.

747
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,160
 I mean, it's people who've been married six times

748
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,700
 are telling you how to date.

749
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,200
 And I would not do that, okay?

750
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,160
 I would not take that advice.

751
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,200
 And so God gives us instructions on how to do this.

752
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,840
 And I just, I wanna show you something.

753
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,280
 It's not law, but it may be helpful to you.

754
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,880
 And so there's this idea of do I want to,

755
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,840
 can I, or should I?

756
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,040
 And so this is when you're thinking,

757
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
 like want to is like,

758
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,960
 man, am I physically attracted?

759
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,160
 Have I given my heart to them?

760
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,140
 That's kind of the want to.

761
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,440
 Has my heart drifted their way?

762
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,200
 The can I is, well, are they married?

763
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,680
 First of all, are they available?

764
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,980
 Are they, you know, are they able?

765
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,160
 Are we, do we like spending time together?

766
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,040
 All that kind of stuff.

767
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,720
 And then the should I is,

768
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,420
 are they running hard after Jesus?

769
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,040
 Are they all the things that the crazy pastor said

770
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,640
 that they should be, you know, should I?

771
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,680
 And then we get married.

772
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,480
 And so what this looks like is you say,

773
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
 okay, well, I definitely want to,

774
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,200
 like he's hot, like she's hot.

775
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,520
 I definitely want to check.

776
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,120
 So now we're at the can I,

777
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,040
 and you're like, oh, oh wow, she's married.

778
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,440
 Okay, done, right?

779
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,560
 And so then what happens is the breakup, right?

780
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,480
 And so, oh, oh, and so this is where you start dating

781
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,160
 'cause you're like, I want to, I'm dating.

782
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,000
 And then you ask the question, well, can I?

783
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,920
 Oh no, we need to break up, I can't.

784
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,480
 The breakup comes and then the heartbreak comes.

785
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,480
 Anybody ever experienced heartbreak?

786
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,360
 You don't have to raise your hand.

787
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,000
 I have to.

788
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,580
 It hurts, it's not fun.

789
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,680
 And it's just, I don't think it's God's ideal.

790
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,200
 And so we start over, right?

791
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,040
 And it was like, okay, well, I want to, okay,

792
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,320
 and so we're dating, the can I, I can, yeah,

793
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,520
 they're available, okay?

794
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,440
 Now it's the should I,

795
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,900
 am I in a place where I should get married?

796
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,480
 Are they in a place where they should get married?

797
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,960
 Have I worked through my baggage?

798
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,280
 Am I struggling with porn?

799
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,120
 Am I not, am I free?

800
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,920
 Do I have addictions?

801
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,160
 Should I, are they running hard after Jesus?

802
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,920
 And then you realize that, no, man, I'm, oh my, oh my,

803
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,400
 they're actually have some addictions.

804
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,220
 There's something going on.

805
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,640
 We should not get married right now.

806
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,080
 There's the X and there's the breakup,

807
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,480
 and this one really hurts.

808
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,760
 And it hurts.

809
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,200
 And so I think what I would propose to you this evening

810
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,240
 is to take this and turn it around on its head.

811
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,920
 And so before you start dating,

812
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,520
 you're hanging out with people,

813
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,280
 and they're all people who love God's people.

814
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,420
 And they're all people who are pursuing purity.

815
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,320
 They're all people who are pursuing hell

816
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,480
 through the scriptures, walking according to the spirit.

817
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,480
 And so you're like, should I absolutely,

818
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,480
 any of these people, I am free to marry any of these people.

819
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,960
 I'm in a place where I can marry,

820
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,720
 they're in a place where they can marry.

821
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,360
 And so then it's like, can I?

822
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,640
 Well, of course, they're available,

823
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,400
 and we enjoy spending time serving God together.

824
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,360
 We're always constantly hanging out.

825
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,920
 And so you've got the can I check,

826
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,200
 but here's the deal, you're not dating yet.

827
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,000
 You're not dating.

828
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,360
 And so now you're like, okay, can I?

829
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,660
 You know what, I'm going to start dating then, I think.

830
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,800
 I think we can begin to date.

831
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,720
 And so now we're in that dating place,

832
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,620
 and dating is answering one question.

833
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,120
 Do I want to spend the rest of my life with them?

834
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,100
 How much time do I need to determine

835
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,060
 if I want to spend the rest of my life with them?

836
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,040
 It's good to start with a plan in mind.

837
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,080
 Is that going to take me three months to determine?

838
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
 One month to determine?

839
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,260
 Is that going to take me six months to determine?

840
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,440
 I know that they're free to date.

841
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,840
 I know that I can date them.

842
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,200
 Now, do I want to spend the rest of my life with them?

843
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,740
 Is the desire there or is it not?

844
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,500
 And if it's there, then it's like, meet me at the altar.

845
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,180
 Let's go.

846
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,020
 Why not?

847
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:10,460
 Hey, you may be tempted to think I've lost my mind.

848
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,900
 I've had a front row seat for this model now for 10 years.

849
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,200
 I've seen it work really well.

850
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
 How are you doing, by the way?

851
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,100
 And I don't mean that offensively.

852
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,600
 How many relationships you've been in?

853
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,240
 How have they been going?

854
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,840
 You ever experienced heartbreak?

855
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,820
 See, I've got this crazy notion

856
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,420
 that God wants us to give our heart away one time.

857
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,100
 Literally, check this out, wait for this.

858
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,920
 I think God wants you to kiss one person.

859
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,580
 What?

860
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,140
 I think that as the creator of the heavens and the earth,

861
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,540
 that that's actually his ideal.

862
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,260
 That he's not like, no, on spring break,

863
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,500
 see how many you can kiss.

864
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,340
 Like, that'll be fun.

865
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,740
 No, that's not how he rolls.

866
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,460
 That's not what he's going for.

867
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,580
 I think dating should actually be the shortest, easiest part.

868
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,200
 It's the place where you have the final conversations

869
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,780
 that you need to have, and you're just deciding,

870
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,180
 man, are we for sure, are we going?

871
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,980
 Are we doing this?

872
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,380
 Are we, we're gonna go, like, forever and ever and ever.

873
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,640
 'Cause you don't know what marriage holds.

874
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,700
 You don't know what that's gonna look like.

875
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,220
 And some of you have given your heart away

876
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,180
 long before the date.

877
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,740
 Like, there's girls here that have given their heart away

878
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,180
 to guys they don't even know.

879
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,780
 I know you learned that from Hollywood.

880
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,080
 I'd be cautious.

881
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,260
 I'm sorry, I know that hurts, I'm sorry.

882
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,780
 And so instead of doing this way,

883
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,380
 we actually start dating in junior high,

884
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,940
 and then from there we date multiple people in high school,

885
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,020
 and from there we actually go to a university

886
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,940
 that instructs us to divorce.

887
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,260
 Because we jump in a relationship,

888
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,560
 and as soon as we don't like them anymore,

889
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,860
 we jump out of the relationship.

890
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,300
 Or worse, we're jumping into a relationship,

891
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,300
 as soon as they don't like us anymore, they jump out.

892
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,620
 And there's baggage in our hearts from that

893
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,780
 that we are oblivious to.

894
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,460
 We don't even know how bad this process has hurt us.

895
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,340
 We have baggage in our lives that we are blind to

896
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,280
 because of heartbreak that we've caused

897
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,380
 and heartbreak that we've experienced.

898
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,380
 And it's not a loving God who's crazy about you,

899
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,620
 it's not his plan for you.

900
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,300
 He has something better planned for you.

901
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,420
 And I know you didn't know, but I'm so glad you're here.

902
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,920
 I'm so glad you're listening.

903
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,420
 See, I think for us, we look at three things

904
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,920
 that we prioritize, chemistry and shared interest

905
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,660
 and physical attraction.

906
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,660
 Do we have chemistry, do we like the same things,

907
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,260
 am I physically attracted to them?

908
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,340
 If you read this on a deserted island,

909
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,620
 there's gonna be three things.

910
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,760
 If you said, hey God, I wanna see what's important to you,

911
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,300
 there's gonna be three things missing.

912
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,060
 Chemistry, shared interest, and physical attraction.

913
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,220
 Hollywood's gonna tell you that's ultimate.

914
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,820
 God's so much better at this than Hollywood is.

915
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,080
 I know you're learning a new way,

916
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,020
 I know it's crazy, I see some of your wheels turning,

917
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,220
 you're like, man, I think you might be onto something.

918
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,140
 Test it, prove it, see if it's true.

919
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,740
 The purpose of dating is confirming a decision to marry.

920
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,340
 That's my second point, rather.

921
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,100
 The purpose of dating is confirming a decision to marry.

922
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,260
 And so this brings us to this idea

923
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
 that marriage is not what you think, verse 39.

924
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,500
 Marriage is not what you think.

925
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,160
 A woman is bound to her husband as long as she lives,

926
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,180
 but if her husband dies,

927
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,860
 she is free to marry anyone she wishes.

928
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,600
 But he must belong to the Lord.

929
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,820
 Very strong language here, she is bound,

930
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,700
 that word means they are stuck together,

931
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,300
 one in flesh, serving each other for a lifetime,

932
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,740
 serving the Lord together for a lifetime.

933
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,900
 But if he dies, then she's to find someone else

934
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,900
 who belongs to the Lord, that criteria that's so important

935
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,940
 that they fully belong to the Lord.

936
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,440
 And if he dies, she can remarry, she can find somebody else.

937
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,800
 And so I've asked several married people,

938
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,240
 several different groups this week,

939
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,080
 hey, what's the one thing that you wish you knew

940
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,240
 before you were married?

941
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,360
 And my response and many of their response would be this.

942
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,960
 I wish I knew how practical marriage is.

943
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,480
 Like how much, it's not so much about the feelings

944
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,320
 and the emotions that are there some days

945
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,560
 and not other days, it's so much more about

946
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,400
 just two people strengthening their ministry together,

947
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,540
 raising children together, pouring into their lives together,

948
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,500
 making disciples together, that you're not looking

949
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,600
 for some trophy wife, you're looking for someone

950
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,760
 to go to war with you.

951
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,180
 You're looking for someone to raise children with you,

952
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,040
 to pour in their lives, someone to study God's word with,

953
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,460
 it's about companionship.

954
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,140
 Proverbs 18, verse 22 says, "He who finds a wife

955
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,100
 "finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord."

956
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,300
 See, marriage is hard but good.

957
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,860
 And marriage is good but hard.

958
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,220
 And there's some of you here tonight that believe

959
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,960
 that marriage is ultimate and what you need to hear tonight

960
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,060
 is you need to hear that it's also hard.

961
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,100
 And there's some of you here tonight that think,

962
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,180
 hey, I'm gonna stay single forever so I can keep having fun

963
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,960
 and what you need to hear is no, marriage is good.

964
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,020
 Marriage is good.

965
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,120
 I went through this workout program here,

966
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,820
 it's like CrossFit here at Watermark, we call it Well.

967
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,460
 And it's like a eating plan and everything

968
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,020
 to produce health in your life.

969
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
 And I don't, if we know each other, you know I don't

970
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,940
 really like to work out very much.

971
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,940
 And so as I saw people go through this and they're doing

972
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,140
 10 flights of stairs and all the crazy things

973
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,700
 that they were doing, I'm like, I am so out on that.

974
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,860
 And but people kept coming to me like, no, it's good,

975
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,460
 it's good, I'm like, it just looks hard.

976
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,060
 They're like, no, but it's good.

977
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,580
 And so eventually they talked me into doing this

978
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,200
 and I got into the program and the room was divided.

979
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,100
 There were people there that knew that it was hard

980
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,340
 and didn't think that it was good.

981
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,820
 And there were people there that knew that it was good

982
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,860
 and didn't think that it would be hard.

983
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,420
 And the truth was it was really hard

984
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,440
 and really, really good.

985
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,540
 It produced so much fruit in my life.

986
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,980
 It changed the way that I think about these things.

987
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
 I'm so glad that I went through it.

988
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,540
 And every day it was really, really hard.

989
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,060
 But it made me better in every way.

990
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,300
 And that's the way that I think about marriage.

991
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,120
 It's often like you going to the same place

992
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,740
 with the same people, same place with the same people.

993
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,900
 It's a lot like working out

994
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,700
 or being a part of a CrossFit box

995
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,660
 or going to a gym or running a race or climbing a mountain

996
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,180
 or whatever metaphor best resonates with you.

997
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,660
 It's like you're doing this thing that's good

998
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,220
 and challenging all the time with the same people.

999
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,060
 And sooner or later you look around

1000
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,140
 and you see her, you know, or him.

1001
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,820
 And you're like, man, we've been doing this together.

1002
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,220
 We've been serving the Lord together.

1003
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,580
 We've been going to church together,

1004
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,840
 the same church, the same place,

1005
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,080
 running in the same groups of friends,

1006
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,840
 serving at the same soup kitchen,

1007
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,020
 going on the same international trips.

1008
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,540
 Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?

1009
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,020
 (congregation laughing)

1010
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
 And it's that simple.

1011
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,340
 And I'm not even kidding.

1012
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,260
 I'm not even playing, man.

1013
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,400
 It is that, and try it your way.

1014
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,940
 And if your way doesn't work, try it his way.

1015
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,980
 I wish you didn't have to try it your way though

1016
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,420
 'cause it's gonna be painful.

1017
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:23,040
 He says, "What I mean, brothers and sisters,

1018
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,240
 "is that the time is short.

1019
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,900
 "From now on, those who have wives

1020
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,820
 "should live as if they do not."

1021
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,440
 Why does he say that?

1022
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,700
 Why does he say that in verse 29 of 1 Corinthians 7?

1023
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,180
 Those who have wives should live as if they don't.

1024
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,100
 Because remember what he said,

1025
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,200
 those who don't have wives should live

1026
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,940
 like undevoted service to the Lord.

1027
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,940
 And he's saying those who have wives

1028
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,260
 now have someone to serve the Lord with.

1029
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,020
 I remember when Monica and I were engaged,

1030
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,260
 12 years ago, we sat in this man's office,

1031
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,020
 this preacher's office, we were brand new Christians,

1032
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,740
 and this guy saw us, and we were very passionate people.

1033
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,220
 We had given ourselves to each other through sex

1034
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,060
 and all sorts of sin, then we became Christians.

1035
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,740
 We trusted in Christ and we did our best

1036
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,320
 to stop all of that and begin to pursue him,

1037
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,080
 but we were still pursuing each other.

1038
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,160
 And this guy just looked at us,

1039
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,720
 saw these two passionate people

1040
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,360
 wildly in love with one another,

1041
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,880
 and he just said, "You guys need to stop pursuing each other

1042
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,960
 "and start pursuing Christ together."

1043
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,200
 And I sat there and I nodded my head and I smiled,

1044
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,440
 and what was going on in my head is,

1045
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,400
 "You are the stupidest man I've ever heard.

1046
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,020
 "That is the dumbest thing."

1047
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,400
 I'm like, "Okay, preacher man,

1048
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,400
 "would you read that in some preacher handbook?

1049
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,700
 "Stop pursuing each other.

1050
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,520
 "We're about to get married, don't you know?"

1051
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,760
 And he just said this, he goes,

1052
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,640
 "When you pursue each other, you miss.

1053
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,680
 "It's manic highs and manic lows.

1054
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,940
 "You guys are so full of passion towards each other.

1055
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,340
 "If you took all of that passion

1056
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,600
 "and you directed it to God

1057
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,280
 "and you pursued God with your entire life,

1058
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,560
 "you're just gonna grow closer and closer

1059
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,940
 "and closer and closer and closer,

1060
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,800
 "but God has to be ultimate, not each other."

1061
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,600
 And guys, it changed everything about me, that advice.

1062
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,840
 I look back on that, it was so prophetic in my life.

1063
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,880
 God used that in profound ways to save my marriage.

1064
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,320
 And then when we started pursuing God together,

1065
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,800
 everything changed for us.

1066
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,440
 It's the best marriage advice I ever could have had.

1067
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,080
 And so marriage is a picture of Christ's commitment to us.

1068
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,600
 In fact, the purpose of marriage,

1069
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,040
 this is my third and final point,

1070
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,240
 the purpose of marriage is to display

1071
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,040
 God's covenant with us.

1072
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,400
 That word covenant there, it's more than a promise.

1073
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,820
 It's more than a commitment.

1074
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,020
 A commitment is, I will if you do.

1075
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,020
 It has terms.

1076
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,420
 A covenant is, I will regardless of what you do.

1077
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,120
 This is beautiful because if you've looked at porn,

1078
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,040
 God's pursued you.

1079
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,800
 If you've had sex, God's pursued you.

1080
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,320
 If you've had abortions, God's pursuing you.

1081
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,060
 He has a covenant towards you.

1082
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,320
 It's a covenant that will be completed

1083
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,600
 regardless of what you do,

1084
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,020
 if you've trusted his payment for your sins

1085
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,360
 through Jesus Christ, his death,

1086
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,920
 as a payment for your sins and his resurrection

1087
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,240
 of evidence of his power,

1088
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,700
 that power that could be at work in your life.

1089
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,620
 And so the purpose of marriage

1090
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,460
 is to display God's covenant with us.

1091
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,980
 A great verse on that is Ephesians 5, verse 31.

1092
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,900
 "For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother

1093
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,780
 "and be united to his wife,

1094
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,960
 "and the two will become one flesh."

1095
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,500
 And then he says this.

1096
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,080
 "This is a profound mystery,

1097
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,980
 "but I'm actually talking about Christ in the church."

1098
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:34,140
 That Jesus is the bridegroom or the groom of the church.

1099
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,480
 And we're his bride.

1100
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,820
 And he's coming back for us.

1101
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,560
 And the narrative in this book, guys,

1102
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,700
 listen, you gotta get this.

1103
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,180
 If you wanna get marriage right, you gotta get this.

1104
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,660
 The narrative in this book,

1105
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
 it's about another relationship,

1106
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,240
 not the one that you would have with your spouse,

1107
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,420
 the one that the church, God's chosen people,

1108
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,340
 has with him.

1109
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,640
 And so I've gone through this,

1110
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,760
 and you might pick up on that I'm a fan of young marriage.

1111
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,460
 I'm a fan of short engagement.

1112
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:11,580
 I'm not a fan of dating until you're ready for marriage.

1113
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,600
 And I'm a fan of changing the world while you're single.

1114
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,280
 And so in summary, the purpose of being single

1115
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,480
 is serving the Lord.

1116
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,480
 The purpose of dating is confirming a decision to marry,

1117
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,640
 and the purpose of marriage

1118
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,860
 is to display God's covenant with us.

1119
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,640
 I didn't understand all this

1120
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,240
 until I really saw the beautiful metaphor that marriage is,

1121
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,480
 that's in the Scriptures,

1122
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,520
 and really in the Hebrew Jewish wedding tradition,

1123
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,560
 but I gotta tell it to you,

1124
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,320
 and I think that you'll be inspired by it as well.

1125
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,680
 And so the way that marriage would work

1126
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,400
 at the time that the Scriptures were written here

1127
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,640
 is that a young Jewish child, a young Jewish boy,

1128
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,280
 would leave his town,

1129
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,240
 and he would go in search for a bride.

1130
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,240
 He'd go to the church,

1131
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,600
 he'd go in search for a bride.

1132
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,880
 He'd go to a foreign land in search for a bride.

1133
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,340
 And when he would find her,

1134
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,280
 his father, his dad, would pay what was called the dowry.

1135
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,740
 His dad would purchase his right to marry her.

1136
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:14,440
 And the two would drink from a cup together.

1137
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,400
 This is where we get so many of the traditions

1138
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,280
 we still celebrate today, the wedding toast, if you will.

1139
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,120
 The two would drink from the same cup.

1140
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,880
 This is why Jesus says, "Can you drink from this cup?"

1141
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,060
 And then he would return to his dad's house.

1142
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,000
 Listen, guys.

1143
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,360
 And he would begin to build a room on his dad's house

1144
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,920
 because that was his inheritance.

1145
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,840
 Like, he was gonna get the property, his father's property.

1146
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,740
 And so he built what was called a bridal chamber.

1147
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,840
 It was a room for him and his wife to live in.

1148
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,120
 Now, she doesn't know when he's coming back for her,

1149
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,200
 but here's what she knows.

1150
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,960
 She knows from that moment forward that she belongs to him,

1151
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,120
 that at some point, unbeknownst to her,

1152
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,280
 that he's gonna come return for her

1153
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,680
 to take him home to himself.

1154
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,880
 And she doesn't know the time or the hour.

1155
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,160
 And when he's finished with that room,

1156
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,960
 he gets his wedding party together.

1157
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,720
 His groomsmen, we call 'em today.

1158
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,840
 She gets her bridal party together.

1159
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,520
 Her bridesmaids, we call 'em today.

1160
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,560
 See, then bridesmaids actually did something.

1161
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,800
 It wasn't just right over left and smile.

1162
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,280
 They were making her wedding dress.

1163
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,000
 They were making her wedding dress.

1164
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 They would remind her daily that she belongs to him,

1165
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,880
 that he's gonna return for her.

1166
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,720
 And then check this out.

1167
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,680
 What would happen is his groomsmen, his boys,

1168
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,140
 they would run out in front of him saying, he's coming.

1169
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,640
 Your groom is coming for you.

1170
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,120
 And they would blow trumpets and make sounds and instruments

1171
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,960
 and that word would travel to towns in front of them

1172
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,600
 like people would spread it.

1173
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,960
 Tell her he's coming for her.

1174
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,280
 He's on his way.

1175
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,780
 And it would reach her and her bridesmaids

1176
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,160
 would come to her house and they'd grab her dress

1177
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,320
 and they would get her all ready and then he would come in

1178
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,680
 and he would take her home with him.

1179
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,580
 And before she entered the bridal chamber,

1180
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,320
 she would be washed, cleansed, cleaned.

1181
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:16,680
 And there was a party waiting for them,

1182
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,640
 but they would go into the bridal chamber

1183
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,200
 and they would consummate the marriage.

1184
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,300
 They would make love.

1185
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,720
 They would pursue physical intimacy

1186
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,560
 in the place of where it was intended

1187
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,000
 with everybody waiting outside, could you imagine?

1188
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,840
 Crazy.

1189
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,160
 And then she would come out with him

1190
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,340
 and he would present to his friends and family

1191
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,040
 for the first time his bride, we're married.

1192
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,960
 And the party would continue for seven days

1193
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,280
 where we get the tradition of the honeymoon.

1194
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,640
 For seven days they would party.

1195
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,700
 For seven days they would celebrate this new relationship.

1196
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,940
 Friends, don't you see when Doubting Thomas said,

1197
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,780
 "Where are you going?

1198
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,620
 "How will we get there?

1199
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,580
 "We do not know the way."

1200
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,980
 And Jesus says to him, "You do know the way.

1201
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,320
 "In my father's house are many rooms.

1202
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,000
 "I go to prepare a place for you.

1203
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,380
 "I'm coming back for you.

1204
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,420
 "I'm coming to take you back home with me."

1205
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,020
 See, this book doesn't say a lot about dating

1206
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,500
 because this book is about another relationship,

1207
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,180
 a much better relationship, an eternal relationship.

1208
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,760
 It's not till death do us part, it's eternity we don't part.

1209
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,700
 It's not for a lifetime, it's for an eternal lifetime,

1210
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,700
 God's radical, reckless pursuit of you.

1211
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,820
 And friends, I gotta tell you something, you're pursued.

1212
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,880
 You wanna be pursued right now, you are being pursued.

1213
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,400
 Not just pursued, but you've been chosen.

1214
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,100
 The God of the universe looks you in the eyes and says,

1215
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,340
 "I choose you to spend the rest of the rest with."

1216
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,720
 And not just chosen, but you've been loved.

1217
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,800
 He said, "I love you so much

1218
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,920
 "that I'm going to prepare an eternal home for you

1219
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,840
 "where your eternal family will be."

1220
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,300
 See, in heaven, no one's married.

1221
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,340
 Monica and I won't be married in heaven.

1222
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,760
 We'll both be married to Jesus in heaven.

1223
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,560
 I know that sounds churchy, man,

1224
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,720
 but I want you to pursue it, prove me wrong.

1225
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,920
 Grab this book tonight and just go through it

1226
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,520
 and say, "I don't know, married to Jesus, are we sure?"

1227
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,880
 Spend some time looking at it.

1228
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,440
 You're chosen, you're pursued, you're loved,

1229
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,860
 he's prepared a home for you.

1230
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,200
 Listen to this part, you gotta hear this.

1231
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,640
 You're gonna be washed clean.

1232
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,540
 If you trusted in Christ, his death and resurrection

1233
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,720
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

1234
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,880
 you've been washed clean,

1235
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,680
 but you still sit in this broken world,

1236
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,820
 and so you're not glorified yet,

1237
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,160
 you're gonna be carried back to the finish line.

1238
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,940
 You'll be washed clean, spotless, no abortion,

1239
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,320
 pornography, filth, that thing you did on the prom night,

1240
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,560
 it's all gone, washed clean.

1241
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,120
 Beautiful, man, so beautiful.

1242
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,540
 And then this part, and I know it's weird,

1243
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,720
 but you get to share in the eternal pleasures

1244
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,120
 with God forever and ever and ever and ever.

1245
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,840
 Forever and ever and ever and ever.

1246
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,320
 I know you got these desires for pleasure right now,

1247
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,200
 I get it, man.

1248
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,260
 People are like, "But you're married,

1249
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,100
 "you have someone to go home with."

1250
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,800
 You don't think I remembered what it was like to be single?

1251
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,740
 I was single in Dallas.

1252
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,980
 I dated in Dallas.

1253
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:33,220
 I dated in DFW, looking for a spouse.

1254
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,760
 I was where you were, I hadn't forgotten what it's like.

1255
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,840
 I know it's hard, but it's worth it.

1256
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
 It's worth it.

1257
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,640
 You're loved, friends.

1258
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,240
 And Father, we thank you just for this truth.

1259
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,120
 For all that you've done for us through Jesus.

1260
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,800
 For your reckless pursuit of us through Christ.

1261
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,120
 For the way that you woo us, the way that you choose us,

1262
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,320
 the way that you pursue us, the way that you love us,

1263
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,880
 the way that you've purchased us,

1264
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,600
 the way that you've given us,

1265
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,720
 purchased us, the way that you cleanse us,

1266
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,280
 the way that you wash us.

1267
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,780
 Daddy, we love you.

1268
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,100
 Father, we love you.

1269
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,440
 Jesus, we love you.

1270
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,120
 Holy Spirit, we love you.

1271
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,040
 Would you help us?

1272
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,220
 We know we messed up.

1273
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,360
 We know we messed up.

1274
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,600
 God, would you help us?

1275
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,400
 Would you help us understand the covenant love

1276
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,480
 that you have for us?

1277
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,240
 Would you help us understand the metaphor

1278
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,120
 that marriage is?

1279
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,480
 Help us to walk in it, to live it.

1280
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,200
 In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
