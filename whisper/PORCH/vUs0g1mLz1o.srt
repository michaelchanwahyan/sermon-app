00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:26,780
 Let's go.

3
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,960
 >> [APPLAUSE] >> What's up, friends in the room?

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,600
 Friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, Northwest Arkansas, Phoenix,

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
 wherever you're listening in from.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,360
 We are continuing this mood series tonight.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,480
 Anyone ever been in a relationship with someone where you feel like

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
 they're not trying as hard as you are?

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,400
 >> [APPLAUSE] >> [LAUGH]

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,240
 Hopefully it's not the person you're here with tonight.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,440
 >> [LAUGH] >> But I recently had this, and

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
 I'm not even talking necessarily in a dating relationship,

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,880
 I'm talking about a friendship.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,280
 A friend of mine, man, you guys have some stuff to vent.

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,600
 >> [LAUGH] >> A friend of mine recently,

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,200
 not long ago, moved up and took a position of a pastor in Fort Worth.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,840
 And my best friend in the world was the best man at my wedding, really close.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,080
 And have just college roommates, spent so much time together.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,520
 And ever since he's moved up there, it's just been that we've missed having

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,320
 to be able to connect.

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,440
 And I have felt at times, dude,

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,760
 I feel like I'm trying harder in this thing than you are, what is the deal?

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,800
 Recently there was a concert that I'd gotten tickets for him and his wife,

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,240
 joined me and my wife, let's go to it.

25
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,200
 And kinda at the last minute he had to bail.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,920
 And then the series of phone tags just continued to take place.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,120
 And there was a shower that we threw and hosted for a mutual friend of ours, and

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,200
 they couldn't come to that either.

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,600
 And it just felt like one thing after the next.

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,680
 And at some point last week, I just kinda had this breaking point where I

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,320
 left him a message.

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,800
 It basically was like, hey dude, I feel like there's something going on, or

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,560
 you're not trying as hard in this relationship right now, what's the deal?

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,200
 And then the next couple days go by and don't really hear anything.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,280
 And then at some point got a phone call, couldn't call him back.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,640
 And it's kinda the end of the week by this point.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,880
 And I'm thinking like, man, I am starting to feel all kinds of just frustration,

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,480
 like what is the deal, bro?

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,360
 I feel like I thought we were boys and we have not been able to hang.

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,560
 And I feel like, what is the deal?

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,120
 And Father's Day rolls around, and little did I know that our wives

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,760
 were totally unaware of this.

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,960
 And they had planned kind of a special day of like, no,

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,400
 here's what we're gonna do to celebrate.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,600
 We're gonna let them, we'll take the kids, and we'll let them go hang out and

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,240
 go to the batting cages, go to Topgolf, and go do all this stuff.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,960
 So my Father's Day surprise was, hey, conflict resolution.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,000
 And so get a chance to go and hang out with him.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,760
 But really what had happened in that situation was some hurt had festered

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 inside of my life, and it began to turn into an anger or resentment.

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
 And I'll come back to that story in a second.

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,920
 And it began to create this kind of like, honestly, as I was told,

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,120
 he's coming over to do batting cages.

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,040
 Part of me was going, I don't even know that I wanna go do Topgolf and

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,880
 batting cages right now.

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,800
 That doesn't sound like fun.

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
 It sounds like we need to work through some stuff before we do that.

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,760
 And it began to create this wall that started with a hurt,

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,040
 that turned into anger, that began to turn into resentment.

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,040
 And I start with that story tonight, and I'll pick up that story and

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,200
 finish it here in a second, because we're continuing this mood series, and

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,880
 we are covering the topic of anger, covering the emotion of anger.

63
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,080
 Oftentimes, anger starts with hurt, and it turns into that.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
 But like few emotions that you're gonna have in life,

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,880
 the power of anger to impact your relationships is tremendous.

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,560
 It is the ability to destroy relationships.

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,360
 It is the reason why some of you don't talk to your parents,

68
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,720
 some of you don't talk to old friends from high school.

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,200
 Some of you switched best friends in high school or

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,440
 college like nine different times because anger or hurt turned into anger and

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,320
 then turned into resentment.

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,000
 And so we're gonna cover what God's word says about this topic.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,280
 Now, just to loop everybody in, in case you're like, dude,

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,480
 we're talking about anger, this feels so not relevant to me.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,080
 Is this just relevant to the guy who goes home, he's angry,

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,440
 punches holes in the wall, the Hulk, basically, the rage man?

77
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,940
 No.

78
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,600
 Anger is one of those emotions that, I mean, it can lead us at times to have

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,640
 explosions, but there's others of us in the room that we don't act out in

80
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,000
 aggression, you act out in passive aggression.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And you act out in not explosions, but this implosion on the inside.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,960
 Some of the most angry people on the face are like, everything's fine,

83
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,680
 this is great, I hate them, I hate all of them.

84
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,120
 That's how some of you express your anger.

85
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,640
 And it's just this internal dialogue.

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,000
 We show the feelings wheel this first week, particularly for the guys,

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
 by the way, this is not in your Bible.

88
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,360
 This is totally just a helpful tool, take it or leave it.

89
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
 But you'll see inside of that, of the idea of anger,

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,640
 it's connected to all kinds of these different sub-emotions that can be

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,160
 connected to.

92
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,280
 In other words, you could be angry, it could look like, man,

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,720
 I'm humiliated right now.

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,280
 You could be angry and just feel like I was really disrespected in that moment.

95
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,480
 It can lead you to be critical of others, it can lead to jealousy,

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,920
 it can lead to all these types of different emotions.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,840
 So we're going to cover what God's Word says about anger.

98
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,920
 And in case you're wondering, does this really apply to me?

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,040
 Here's some scenarios where it's a likelihood or a good chance that you

100
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,920
 are angry.

101
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,760
 Is there anyone inside of your life that you would just be a little bit happy if

102
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,040
 things weren't going great in their life?

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,800
 Like if they failed or they didn't get the promotion or they didn't get that new

104
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,360
 car or their boyfriend broke up with them, you would be like, "Oh,

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,800
 I'm so sorry."

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
 Yes.

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,120
 You probably have some hurt that has turned into anger or resentment in their

108
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,600
 life.

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,880
 Is there anyone in your life that their name, they're like Voldemort,

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,240
 it is the name that shall not be named.

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,400
 You bring it up and it's like, "I can't, I don't even want to talk about this

112
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,840
 person right now.

113
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,280
 I thought you knew that we're not good, okay?"

114
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,200
 You probably have some anger or hurt that's turned into resentment.

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,400
 Is there anyone you would avoid in public because if something happened,

116
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
 something that happened between you?

117
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,920
 Is there anyone that you're waiting to let back into your life to have a

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,040
 relationship and you won't let them back in until they apologize?

119
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,920
 There's probably some hurt that has turned into anger and is impacting life.

120
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,520
 Do you often battle lots of thoughts in your mind going on?

121
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,360
 Will you just find yourself trapped in like, "What are they thinking about me?

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,320
 I'm prone to negatively interpreting what they're thinking."

123
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,560
 There could be some anger that's turned into resentment in your life.

124
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,960
 Are you prone to keep all of your feelings to yourself?

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
 There could be some anger and resentment that's taking place there.

126
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
 All of them may be reflections that there's anger going on below the surface.

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
 And so the last thing I would say is unlike very few emotions, this one will

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,520
 hurt your relationships now, will impact your future marriage that you're going to

129
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,280
 have your ability to resolve and work through resentment and hurt and anger and

130
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,120
 prevent it from becoming bitterness, and really impact the rest of the

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,720
 trajectory of your life, your work environment, your overall relational

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,600
 satisfaction, ability to keep relationships with friends.

133
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,600
 So we're going to look at what the Bible says as it looks to the source of our

134
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,120
 anger, some of the side effects that the Bible says, "Hey, if you allow anger to be

135
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,720
 a part of your life in any way, these are the things that are going to take place."

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,280
 And then the solution that God really clearly lays out in the New Testament as

137
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,800
 it relates to dealing with our anger.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,720
 So the first, let's cover, it comes from Matthew, Mark chapter 7, verse 21.

139
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:19,680
 Jesus says this, "For it is within and out of a person's heart that evil thoughts come."

140
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,920
 Jesus says, "Okay, the evil thoughts that you have, the evil thoughts that lead to

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,960
 actions, those don't flow from external circumstances, those flow from your heart."

142
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,840
 What type of evil thoughts or actions?

143
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
 Sexual morality, theft, murder.

144
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
 What do you mean murder is a thought?

145
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,280
 Yeah, anger can lead you to a place where you begin to think of like, "Man, I just

146
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,040
 wish they were not in my life to the point of murder."

147
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,560
 Adultery, greed, malice, which is just a word for being mean towards someone.

148
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,600
 Deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, which is just talking bad about somebody.

149
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,480
 Arrogance and folly.

150
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,800
 All of these evils come from inside and defile a person.

151
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
 The first idea that really I want to camp out and talk about for a little bit, and this

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,880
 is so huge, is the source of the sinful anger in your life comes from your heart.

153
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,080
 Particularly two places.

154
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,680
 From the fact that every single one of us has a sinful heart, the Bible says.

155
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,640
 And then the other place that it comes from is just hurts that get lodged.

156
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
 But when I say sinful anger, let me explain what I mean, why I even have that included

157
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
 in there.

158
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,120
 If you take notes, the first idea is that source of your sinful anger is your heart.

159
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,200
 When I say this, let me qualify by saying the Bible does not say anger is a sin.

160
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,800
 It says anger is an emotion that was given to us like every emotion by God, and it is

161
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,520
 possible to be angry and not sin.

162
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
 God was angry.

163
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,160
 There is such a thing as righteous anger.

164
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,760
 But for the purpose of really the next 25 minutes, I'm gonna focus in on sinful anger

165
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,960
 because I've never met somebody who's like, "I feel like the biggest problem in my world

166
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,640
 is too much righteous anger.

167
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,520
 That's leading me to do all kinds of godly things."

168
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,560
 That just isn't usually the types of conversations that I get into.

169
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
 So we're gonna focus on sinful anger.

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,400
 And that sinful anger, you can trace the source, the Bible says, all the way directly to your

171
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 heart.

172
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,920
 That if you just focus on your external behavior, you're not addressing the root of the problem.

173
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,560
 That's what I mean by these sinful areas of the heart is sinful and it can lead to anger

174
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
 expressing itself.

175
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,640
 Sometimes it looks like selfishness.

176
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,520
 The reason why if you have road rage, you're angry is because there's something in your

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,120
 heart and there's a selfishness that, "Hey, get out of my way.

178
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,720
 I wanna get where I wanna get on time, and I just get so angry about it."

179
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
 There's a selfishness.

180
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,320
 There's a sinful aspect of your heart that leads you to anger.

181
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,720
 Another way that it can flesh itself out is entitlement.

182
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,880
 Some of you are angry at God because you feel entitled to being further along in your job,

183
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,720
 in a different city altogether, in a married relationship, in any relationship, and you

184
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,600
 have this anger because it results or it's coming from a sinful entitlement that you

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
 have.

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
 Envy can lead us to anger.

187
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,000
 We look around in comparison and feel like, "Man, everyone else has the things that I

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,640
 should have and I'm angry about it.

189
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
 I'm angry at them.

190
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
 I'm angry at God."

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,520
 Stress and the need for approval from others can be a huge trigger for anger.

192
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,560
 That is the biggest trigger in my life for anger is I can feel overwhelmed and stressed

193
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,220
 about things that at the source or root of that, I'm really just like worried about what

194
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,360
 other people are thinking about me, how successful or how impressive that I am in life.

195
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
 If I can't accomplish those things, it can lead to anger because there's a sinful part

196
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
 of my heart.

197
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
 I'm going to tell you why that's so important.

198
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,400
 The second area is not just the fact that all of us come into this room with a broken

199
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,840
 heart that when sin entered the world, it entered the human heart.

200
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,800
 You can trace back all the anger and sinful expressions of it to the heart, but you can

201
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,160
 also trace it to the fact that along the journey of life, there will be people that hurt us

202
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,240
 and do things to us, and inside of that hurt, it can get lodged if it's not dealt with in

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,200
 a healthy way, that hurt from somebody betraying us, somebody lying to us, somebody doing something

204
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,600
 that just hurts us, it can get lodged into our heart, and it becomes something where

205
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,960
 it turns eventually into anger, it turns into resentment, and we begin to hold it against

206
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
 those people.

207
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,240
 In Hebrews 12, verse 15, it says this, "See to it that no one falls short of the grace

208
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:05,600
 of God, and that no bitter root or the root of bitterness grows up and causes trouble

209
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,480
 and defiles many."

210
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,000
 The Bible says that the root or the bitterness, bitterness can be like a root inside of your

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 life.

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 It's such a genius analogy because what's a root?

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,200
 It's something that's below the surface that even though you can't see it on the outside,

214
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,800
 it's impacting what's above the surface.

215
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 And the Bible says that if you allow it, if you allow it hurts from other people in your

216
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,400
 life and you don't handle them God's way, we'll talk about that, that it becomes like

217
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:37,160
 this root, that it grows, and even though not everyone can see exactly what's underneath,

218
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,240
 it's impacting what's above and on the surface, and it leads us to lash out, to respond in

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,640
 anger, to wall off, and shed other people out of our life.

220
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,440
 The two areas that really the source of the anger inside of your life, or resentment,

221
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,400
 or bitterness, or any of those different things, comes from the heart just being sinful, and

222
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,760
 from hurt and harboring hurt inside of your heart, and undealt with hurt grows.

223
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,680
 Anger is a signal that there is something there that should be addressed.

224
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,720
 There's two types, let me explain it kind of this way.

225
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,440
 There's two types of people as it relates to a very specific thing, and that is something

226
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,720
 called the check engine light in your car.

227
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,080
 When I get in my wife's car, or my wife's car not long ago, I got into it, and in the

228
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,640
 car we were driving along, and all of a sudden the check engine light was on, and I was like,

229
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,760
 "The check engine light is on.

230
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,760
 Do you know that?

231
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 Have you known that?"

232
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
 And she was like, "Oh yeah, it's been on for a while."

233
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,080
 Some of you in the room are kind of like my wife, where you're like, "Oh yeah, it's fine.

234
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
 It basically is like I'm low on gas.

235
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,840
 I'll fix it at some point.

236
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
 I'm sure everything's fine."

237
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,560
 And then there's others of us who are like, "The check engine light is on.

238
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
 The car could totally shut down.

239
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,440
 Like you may have an oil tank, it could total the car.

240
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 Do you know that?

241
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,800
 Do you guys know that?

242
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
 That's just for free."

243
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,280
 And either way, whatever perspective you have on that, here's what we all agree on.

244
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,460
 The check engine light is a signal that there's something below the surface or beneath the

245
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,920
 hood that needs to be addressed.

246
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,840
 That's why it's on.

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,440
 Human emotions, we've said, and anger in particular, is a signal to you and to me.

248
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
 Every time you feel a human emotion, if you get nothing else out of this entire series,

249
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 it should be this.

250
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,920
 Hopefully a lot more, but at least this.

251
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,800
 Every time you feel something, and anger, for example, should be a signal to you, there's

252
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,120
 something going on inside of my heart that I need to address.

253
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,960
 That you need to learn the art of whenever you're feeling something, like why, beginning

254
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,180
 to wonder and ask, "Why am I feeling what I'm feeling?

255
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,180
 What is going on?

256
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,320
 What is the check engine light, which is this emotion, telling me?

257
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,280
 And why am I feeling the way that I'm feeling?"

258
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,800
 Learning the skill, if you will, of monitoring your heart.

259
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,000
 What do I mean by monitoring your heart?

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,080
 Here's like what society will help us do.

261
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,160
 Everyone in this room has been raised to monitor their behavior.

262
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,080
 And from very early on, you were taught, "Hey, monitor your behavior if you want to be successful

263
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
 in life at all."

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,280
 At elementary school, it's like, "Hey, if you're good, you get to put the green sticker

265
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
 on.

266
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
 If you're bad, you don't.

267
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,920
 If you move on to middle school and you get demerits, if you don't behave, you're gonna

268
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
 get in trouble."

269
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
 Everyone's taught to monitor their behavior.

270
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,920
 In fact, as a society, we have really collectively said, "You're gonna learn to monitor your

271
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,940
 behavior or we're gonna monitor it for you."

272
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,600
 And that thing is called prison.

273
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,460
 Because in prison, you no longer get to choose your behavior anymore.

274
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,520
 And so if you can't learn to monitor your behavior, we're gonna put you in prison.

275
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,960
 And so many of us, most of us, we kind of learn not to just follow every instinct that

276
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,160
 we have and to kind of check and monitor our behavior.

277
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,900
 But rarely do people learn to monitor your heart, to stop and say, "Why am I feeling

278
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,640
 what I'm feeling?"

279
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,840
 When I was waiting for my friend at, you know, that Topgolf, I was sitting there beginning

280
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,240
 to dress and beginning to go, "Man, why am I feeling like this right now?

281
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,700
 What is going on inside of my heart that makes me feel this way?

282
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,080
 I feel like I'm trying harder than he is and maybe it's because I've placed unrealistic

283
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,300
 expectations on him.

284
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,700
 He's got a ton going on.

285
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,020
 He's got little kids.

286
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,460
 Is there something that I have done to place unrealistic expectations?

287
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,980
 And I think that also I've associated quickness and response time to intimacy in a relationship

288
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,340
 or closeness in a relationship.

289
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,260
 Like, what is going on beneath the surface?"

290
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,480
 Anytime you feel anger, frustration, resentment, that should be a signal to you, there's something

291
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,440
 going on there.

292
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,160
 Some of you, there are men and women, you don't like women or you are resentful towards

293
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,420
 women or you look down on women.

294
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,220
 You should go, "What is that inside of me?"

295
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,440
 There are women in the room and you're angry and bitter towards men and that resentment

296
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,340
 should signal to you, "What is going on in my heart?"

297
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,000
 When you get angry at your boss, when you get angry in a dating scenario, when any emotion

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,780
 comes on its own, learning the heart of the going, "What is going on inside of my heart?

299
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,540
 What would God's Word say about this emotion?

300
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,180
 What are the lies that I'm beginning to believe?

301
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,460
 What are the things in general I'm believing?"

302
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,660
 And addressing those by monitoring your heart.

303
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,580
 If you get nothing else, the skill of going, "Hey, every time you feel something, that

304
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,140
 should be a signal to you.

305
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,260
 There's something going on underneath the hood or underneath and in the heart that needs

306
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,380
 to be addressed and aligned with God's Word."

307
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
 Involving community.

308
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,580
 If you have a community group, which hopefully you do, involving them if you're at a place

309
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,240
 where like, "I don't know exactly what I'm feeling or why I'm feeling what I'm feeling

310
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,920
 right now."

311
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,340
 Because if you fail to address at a heart level what you're feeling, you're failing

312
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,020
 to address the root of what you're feeling.

313
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,860
 And the root will lead you to why you're feeling it.

314
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,420
 So the first thing you've got to know if you're going to have any victory inside of this and

315
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,420
 really emotions in general is that the source of sinful anger comes from the heart.

316
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,380
 Second thing comes from Matthew chapter 5, where Jesus further talks on this topic and

317
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,300
 he says this.

318
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
 Starting in verse 21.

319
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,360
 "You've heard it said," it's in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, and he's teaching

320
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,640
 basically Jesus' first sermon ever and he launches into several topics, one of them

321
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
 being anger.

322
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,440
 "You've heard it said long ago, 'You shall not murder.'

323
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,600
 And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.

324
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,360
 But I tell you that anyone who is angry," or your translation may say, "angry in the

325
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,720
 heart with a brother or a sister will be subject to judgment."

326
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,000
 Jesus says, "Hey, everyone thinks it's the standard.

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,680
 As long as you don't murder somebody, you're good.

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,880
 And I've come and I'm telling you that the standard is not murder.

329
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,160
 The standard is you being angry.

330
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,120
 If you hold on to anger in your heart, you are just as liable and subject to judgment

331
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,880
 as the person who's murdered."

332
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
 And then he says this.

333
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,680
 "Therefore," verse 23, "if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember

334
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,280
 that your brother or sister has something against you, that there's something between

335
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,160
 you two, leave your gift there in front of the altar.

336
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,800
 First go and be reconciled to them and then come and offer your gift at the altar."

337
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,200
 So Jesus says, "Hey, look, if you are sitting in church and you're sitting there and you're

338
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,600
 raising your hands and you're like, 'This is how I fight my battles,' or there's another

339
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,360
 in the fire and he hits you, oh man, I've got some beef with him, with her.

340
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,960
 I'm holding something against a Christian brother or sister that you should put your

341
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
 hands down.

342
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
 You should walk out.

343
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
 You should call them.

344
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,640
 You should attempt to address the scenario or attempt to be reconciled to them."

345
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,160
 Think about how crazy that is.

346
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,120
 The God who's there says, "Hey, you can't be okay here vertically unless you are okay

347
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:13,220
 horizontally and I want you," like think about this, "to prioritize your horizontal relationships

348
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
 before me."

349
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,520
 In other words, you can't be right and you can't have this being the priority of your

350
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,280
 life if you are not okay with other brothers and sisters who are Christians.

351
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
 So I want you to go and first be reconciled to them because anytime that you allow anger

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,620
 to sit inside of your heart, it creates a wall in your relationships, creates damage

353
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,800
 in your relationships to one another and God says it walls you off from him.

354
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,360
 First address them before you come and deal with me.

355
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,920
 The second point, if you take note, so we're just talking about is the side effect of sinful

356
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,000
 anger is harmed relationships.

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Harmed relationships.

358
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,800
 Every time that anger sits and it's not dealt with in the right way, it turns into bitterness

359
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,240
 and it always puts a barrier up, it always hurts the relationships.

360
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,800
 Maybe for you this looks like with a parent, like we've all experienced this in so many

361
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,000
 different ways, we just talk for hours about examples and illustrations, where we get hurt

362
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,980
 and it turns to anger and we begin to put barriers, we begin to kind of keep them at

363
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,120
 a distance because I'm gonna begin to wall that up.

364
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,160
 Maybe it was with a parent and you have a dad who walked out and divorced your mom or

365
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,620
 you have a mom who walked out and left your family and that created hurt and it's turned

366
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,920
 into an anger and you kind of begin to keep them at a distance.

367
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,440
 Maybe you have a resentment or an anger towards a parent, you're like dude, my dad, he never

368
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,040
 came to my sports games all throughout growing up and that hurt has turned into an anger

369
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 and a resentment.

370
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,680
 Maybe you have just parents, you're like dude, nothing was ever good enough for them.

371
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,480
 Everything that I did, they had these unrealistic expectations, it was exhausting and it hurt

372
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
 and I'm angry about it and you don't even realize it.

373
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,780
 None of this happens consciously where we're like and now I'm choosing to be angry about

374
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
 it.

375
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:55,940
 It just sits there and it begins to place a barrier relationally between the two of

376
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
 us.

377
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,540
 Maybe it's with a boss at work and you just feel disrespected all the time.

378
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,220
 You just feel like man, I'm hurt by that and now I'm angry and now I don't even want to

379
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,940
 work for this person, I'm looking at LinkedIn all the time.

380
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,460
 When I go to job, that's what I do.

381
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,060
 They disrespected you, maybe they dismissed your idea in front of everyone.

382
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,760
 Maybe they gave the promotion to the guy who's only been there for six months, you're like

383
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,840
 I've been here for three years, are you serious?

384
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,680
 And it's created a hurt that's led to an anger and it's created a barrier and a distance.

385
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:30,240
 Anytime that hurt is undealt with or is not dealt with in God's way, it creates, it hurt

386
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,880
 turns into an anger, it turns into a bitterness and that bitterness begins to build a wall.

387
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,760
 It's like this, anytime that there is a giant blanket on the stage and a platform, okay,

388
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:47,280
 watch out, it's like in our relationships, every time that somebody hurts us, we begin

389
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,000
 to build a wall and it's a wall that separates us from them.

390
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,720
 So some of you guys have like friendships and I mean, you've like switched around with

391
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,380
 friends so many different times because as it relates to them being your friend, they've

392
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,560
 just hurt you and you don't even realize it and each time they hurt you, you didn't address

393
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,480
 it, you didn't talk about it, you didn't bring it to them, you didn't extend forgiveness,

394
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,960
 you were like I'm just gonna hold on to that.

395
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,440
 This is just the type of person you are.

396
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,960
 So I can't believe that you didn't invite me on that vacation with all of my friends

397
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
 and it doesn't even fit in there and I'm angry about it and you got to go and you're like,

398
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,800
 oh, I didn't know that you liked the beach.

399
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,120
 Who doesn't like the beach?

400
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
 Are you serious?

401
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,560
 And you went without me and you deserted me.

402
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,960
 And then I found out that, you know, I wasn't even included in your wedding party and you're

403
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,040
 getting engaged so you got engaged, you're gonna get married and I'm not just not a bridesmaid,

404
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,480
 I'm not even in the house party.

405
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,160
 You serious?

406
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
 Not the house party?

407
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
 That's like the B-level bridesmaids.

408
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
 I didn't even make that.

409
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,960
 If you're not from Texas and you're listening in, house party, it's like the B-level bridesmaids.

410
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,360
 Still gotta buy a dress but it's kind of like we're close but not that close.

411
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
 I'm not even in that and you begin to build the bricks and you're like, I can't believe

412
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
 you don't even follow me on Instagram.

413
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
 This is ridiculous.

414
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,320
 You don't even know that I'm dating someone now 'cause you don't follow me on Instagram

415
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,920
 and I am just upset and I begin to put these bricks in place and one by one, I just decide,

416
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
 hey, I'm not gonna have any relationship.

417
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,600
 And then I heard that you talked bad about me that one time and I'm getting out of breath

418
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,240
 and I'm like, these bricks, oh golly.

419
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,760
 It is heavy to carry bitterness around and bitterness, I act like that was planned and

420
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,160
 just one by one by one.

421
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,720
 In fact, you didn't text me back.

422
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
 I texted you about having dinner plans this past weekend and I know that you saw it 'cause

423
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
 I saw the little dots pop up and I know it was there.

424
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
 And you know, the last time that we hung out, I paid for your meal and you didn't Venmo

425
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
 me.

426
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,640
 It was only eight bucks but it's the principle of the thing and my birthday came up, you

427
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:46,600
 didn't even wish me happy birthday and all of a sudden, I start jogging.

428
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:53,200
 One by one, that bitterness is like bitter bricks and it creates a wall.

429
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,120
 And the sad and crazy thing is that on the other side of that wall is not just your friend

430
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,560
 or not just your parent or not just a coworker, God says, you can put me over there too.

431
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,840
 Because the intimacy that you're gonna have with me is gonna always be hindered until

432
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,640
 you get right with them.

433
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,720
 This is what I mean by like some of us, we just have friends that we've gotten so good

434
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,400
 at building up walls and hey, if you do me wrong, like I'm done with you.

435
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,240
 And so we just move on and we don't talk to them for another six months.

436
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,560
 We don't talk to them for another couple years and then all of a sudden, that roommate that

437
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,000
 I was so close with, man, they kind of betrayed me.

438
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,560
 I'm upset about that dating thing that happened and now we just don't talk anymore.

439
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,440
 Because one by one, and the crazy thing about this is like these get easier to put up every

440
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,720
 single time.

441
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,760
 All of a sudden, you're like, man, of course you don't call me back.

442
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,160
 You don't even think about this, it's just kind of who you are.

443
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,440
 And even more dangerous, some of us have friends and they will help us build the wall.

444
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,160
 They will help us be like, yes, they don't ever call you back.

445
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,720
 That's just the type of person that they are.

446
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,400
 Put another one on there.

447
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,680
 And it is tragic.

448
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,560
 And Satan loves that we build the wall.

449
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,620
 He loves that we cut people off.

450
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,520
 His whole goal is to divide you, to separate you, to see the church divided.

451
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,800
 And it doesn't happen and these walls don't get built overnight, it's just one by one

452
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,440
 by one, we begin to put them up and put them in place.

453
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,240
 But there is a solution.

454
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,320
 The Bible says to deal with the hurt that turns into this resentment that just builds

455
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 this wall.

456
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:42,440
 Ephesians chapter four says this, verse 26, "In your anger, do not sin.

457
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:49,280
 Do not let the sun go down while you are angry and do not give the devil a foothold.

458
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:57,160
 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander, and every form of malice or evil

459
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,000
 intent.

460
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,720
 Be kind and compassionate to one another."

461
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,600
 So Paul just said, hey, get rid of all anger, all bitterness, all brawling, brawling is

462
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,920
 your thing, get rid of all of that and replace it with being kind and compassionate.

463
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,040
 That sounds so easy, Paul.

464
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
 Really?

465
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 Just be nice, that's your solution?

466
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,040
 No, he says how you can do that.

467
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,720
 Forgiving one another.

468
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,080
 Just as Christ, in Christ, God has forgiven you.

469
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,840
 The remedy for all of the anger, all of the things you hold onto, all the bitterness that

470
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,120
 marks your life, all the resentment that's beneath the surface, there is one remedy that

471
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,240
 the Bible says and that is through forgiveness.

472
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,600
 Making the decision, hey, I'm gonna choose to forgive this person.

473
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 What is forgiveness?

474
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,680
 So the third idea is the solution for the sinful anger in your life, for the broken

475
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,400
 relationships in your life, for the times that somebody did you wrong in your life,

476
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,560
 is forgiveness.

477
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,280
 Making the decision, I'm gonna choose to forgive just as God in Christ has forgiven me.

478
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,880
 I'm making the decision to forgive.

479
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 So what is forgiveness?

480
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,680
 Well, let's talk about what it isn't.

481
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,960
 Forgiveness is not excusing someone's sin.

482
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,880
 Hey, you cheated on me and that was okay.

483
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,120
 Hey, you lied to me and that was okay.

484
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
 We're just gonna excuse that.

485
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,920
 That's not what God does at all.

486
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,160
 He doesn't excuse someone's sin and say it's not that serious.

487
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,680
 It was so serious it put Jesus on the cross.

488
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,760
 So it's not excusing it and saying, hey, it's not that big of a deal.

489
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
 It's not forgetting.

490
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,760
 Sometimes people will say, hey, forgive and forget.

491
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
 You don't forgive and forget.

492
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,400
 In order to forgive, you cannot forget because it's choosing.

493
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,240
 I know the offense that was created and I'm choosing to forgive.

494
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,040
 And I'm gonna tell you what forgiveness is here in a second.

495
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,800
 The two other things that it's not, it's not denying hurt or angry.

496
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,720
 If you've been hurt or sinned against, you shouldn't deny it.

497
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,640
 God gets angry over sin.

498
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,040
 Forgiveness is not conditional and it doesn't require the person asking for it or to own

499
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,480
 their part or even be present.

500
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,900
 Forgiveness is releasing the demand for justice to God.

501
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,000
 Forgiveness is deciding I am releasing the demand for justice over how I was wrong, how

502
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,280
 I was hurt, what was done to me.

503
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
 I'm gonna trust God with that.

504
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,840
 I am choosing to forgive every sin that's ever been, ever taken place will either be

505
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,460
 paid for, has been paid for on the cross by Jesus or by the person for all of eternity.

506
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,120
 So if they're a believer and they've trusted in Christ, I am choosing to release any need

507
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,040
 for justice or vengeance to God.

508
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,900
 Ultimately, that's in his hands and he'll account for it.

509
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,280
 And I'm choosing to let go of the debt.

510
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,480
 What does forgiveness look like practically?

511
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
 So that's what it is.

512
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 How do you do forgiveness practically?

513
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 The first thing is this, the scripture says to overlook an offense if you can.

514
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,720
 It says in Proverbs chapter 19 verse 11, a person's wisdom yields patience.

515
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,920
 It is to one's glory to overlook an offense.

516
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,380
 So the Proverbs say, hey, it is a glorious thing if somebody does something that offends

517
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,920
 you and you're able to be like, hey, I believe the best, it's okay, I'm sure they didn't

518
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
 mean it.

519
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,520
 If you can overlook it, it's a glorious thing, the scripture says.

520
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,240
 How do I know if I can overlook it?

521
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,360
 Can you overlook it?

522
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,840
 If you find yourself replaying the tape or rehearsing the conversation and thinking about

523
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 that moment again, and I can't believe that they did that, and really reinvesting or rethinking

524
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,200
 through the scenario again, there's probably a good likelihood you cannot overlook it.

525
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,440
 If you replay the tape one time, two times, three times, you should move towards reconciling

526
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
 with that person.

527
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,520
 The first thing is, if you can't overlook it, overlook it.

528
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,840
 If you can't, the Bible says that you and I are to move quickly.

529
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,720
 So how do you resolve or how do you extend forgiveness and deal with anger, deal with

530
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,500
 the bitter bricks that are in your life?

531
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,040
 The first thing is, whenever one of those bricks popped up and I'm tempted to put it

532
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,720
 on there, I'm gonna move quickly to deal with it and extend forgiveness to that person.

533
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,880
 It says, don't let the sun go down on your anger.

534
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,660
 In Ephesians four, we just read the verse.

535
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,560
 Does that mean literally, don't let the sun go down before your anger?

536
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
 I don't know.

537
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
 I don't think so.

538
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
 He's just saying, hey, move quickly.

539
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,280
 Here's why I think, probably not, because if you lived in Alaska during the summer,

540
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,880
 you would have the entire summer to not deal with any anger.

541
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
 You'd be like, sun never goes down.

542
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,560
 It can't be literal if it's saying, hey, it has to, if the sun goes down, the people in

543
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,080
 Alaska are like, yep, I got 'til September and then I'll deal with this.

544
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,440
 He's just saying, hey, move quickly.

545
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
 Keep short accounts.

546
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
 If there's something that happened, if you got hurt by something, move quickly.

547
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,400
 Don't try to put it away or dismiss it if you can't.

548
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,800
 And most of us, honestly, we are peace fakers.

549
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 We're not peacemakers.

550
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,080
 And so when somebody hurts us, you need to move in the direction of, hey, this hurt me

551
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,720
 when you did that.

552
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720
 So move quickly.

553
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
 Keeping short accounts.

554
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,320
 If everyone in this room just did this, it would change the world.

555
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,600
 Because how many people sit on something, and I've been thinking about this for six months.

556
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,640
 The second thing is that when you go and you discuss and say, hey, this hurt me, when you

557
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,640
 bring up the hurt that took place, the anger that you're holding onto, you need to own

558
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,640
 your part.

559
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,000
 You know what it says in Matthew chapter seven?

560
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,320
 Jesus says, before you do anything to address the sin in someone else's life, you need to

561
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,600
 first own your part.

562
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,840
 Own everything that you can about the situation.

563
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,480
 Some of you, maybe the thing that most you need to own is you've been holding onto being

564
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,280
 hurt or being sinned against for years.

565
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,960
 And you need to go tonight, tomorrow, quickly and say, hey, will you forgive me?

566
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,040
 You hurt me like six months ago and I've been holding onto that and it's impacted the way

567
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,080
 that I see you, the way that I think about you, honestly, the way that I talk about you.

568
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,440
 My likelihood to do 10 things if you're around because honestly, it just hurt me.

569
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,000
 And you need to ask for forgiveness for holding onto that if they're a believer.

570
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,660
 Because the Bible says you are to move quickly.

571
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,360
 Do not give the devil a foothold in your life.

572
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,080
 And by waiting and prolonging, you are giving him a foothold.

573
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,620
 So go, move quickly, own your part, and then when you go to them, go and focus on two things

574
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,620
 in particular.

575
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,400
 So when you talk, you're like, hey, this is what happened and this is when you hurt me.

576
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,480
 Focus on two very specific things, very, very specific things.

577
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,800
 When you go to them, you don't focus on their motive and hey, you always do this type of

578
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
 thing.

579
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
 You focus on two things.

580
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,360
 The very specific action that they did.

581
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,600
 You did not call me back.

582
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,360
 And then the specific emotion it created in you.

583
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,720
 And when you did that, it made me feel like you don't care about me.

584
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,480
 I'm gonna focus not on like, hey, you're just, you're a bad apple.

585
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,040
 This is what, the type of person that you are.

586
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,960
 Don't focus on, don't say statements like you always or you are, but focus on when you

587
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
 did X.

588
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,080
 It made me feel X.

589
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,800
 Whenever you did not invite me on that trip with all of our roommates, it made me feel

590
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,520
 like you don't care about me.

591
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,200
 It made me feel alone.

592
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,480
 Address the very specific behavior that they had.

593
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,600
 Don't attack their motive, don't attack their character.

594
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,200
 Just attack or focus on the very specific behavior that they had and then what it made you feel

595
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 inside of you.

596
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,760
 Finally, the fourth component or fifth component, what it looks like to forgive someone is to

597
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,880
 extend grace over and over and over.

598
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,320
 In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus says, or he's asked the question by Peter, how many times

599
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
 should I forgive someone?

600
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,880
 Up to seven times if they've sinned against me.

601
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,920
 And Jesus says 70 times seven, some of your translations, 'cause there's a footnote on

602
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,400
 it, that the Greek is unclear whether he's saying 77 times or 70 times seven times seven.

603
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,600
 As in like on and on and on, that there is no end, there's no limit that God puts on

604
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,680
 it because you're to forgive like God in Christ forgives you.

605
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,800
 And he doesn't have some limit of, all right, you just reached 77, I guess that's it, we're

606
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,120
 done.

607
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,720
 That over and over, that as believers, you are called to forgive, you are commanded.

608
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,520
 And God says if you do not forgive, God will not forgive you.

609
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
 Think about that.

610
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,200
 That as painful as the hurt is, as long as you've carried it, as deep as the scars run,

611
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,000
 that there's a God who's there who says, I want you to work towards healing.

612
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
 And as long as you carry anger around, you're gonna build up walls in every direction.

613
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,560
 And eventually you're gonna wall yourself off and the wall comes over here, the wall

614
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,280
 comes over here, the wall comes around, and you make a prison for yourself.

615
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,520
 And the way that you tear down the wall is one brick at a time.

616
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,960
 Hey, you forgot to invite me, I'm forgiving you.

617
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,160
 You didn't show up and you weren't a part of my sports games, and I'm forgiving you.

618
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,920
 I'm not gonna hold onto that anymore.

619
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,200
 And I'm choosing to make the decision, I'm not gonna carry this.

620
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
 How long are you gonna carry it?

621
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,160
 Like for real, how long are you gonna be angry at what happened when you grew up?

622
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560
 How long are you gonna hold it against your friend from high school?

623
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,720
 How long are you gonna hold it against your sibling?

624
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,920
 How long are you not gonna call your parents back?

625
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
 I want you to answer that.

626
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,700
 Like some of you, you need to tonight, you've got some business, the God who's there says

627
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,880
 you need to leave here right now.

628
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,760
 Leave your gift at the altar.

629
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,600
 And you need to go be reconciled with the people in your life.

630
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
 You're carrying around the hurts.

631
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,140
 And the only way you're gonna break down those barriers, and the God who's there hates that

632
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,140
 there's barriers.

633
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,520
 The scripture says that he came in Ephesians chapter two to tear down the dividing wall

634
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,200
 of hostility between people.

635
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,960
 Satan loves the barriers.

636
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,000
 He wants you to think right now, you're the victim, you were harmed, you can't do anything

637
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,640
 about it, you should be angry.

638
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,320
 He wants you to hold onto that.

639
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,720
 And when you do, it makes every relationship you have, it's a lot easier, I'm just gonna

640
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,320
 put these bricks back on, that's just who I'm gonna be.

641
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,680
 So they own it, and they deserve it, I'm done with those people.

642
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,800
 And there's a freedom that God offers, and the freedom comes through choosing, I'm going

643
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,340
 to forgive, even though they didn't earn it, even though they don't deserve it, I'm choosing

644
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,900
 that, I'm not gonna let this define my life.

645
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,020
 If you're in a dating relationship, this is so huge, we're about to land a plane.

646
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,600
 Before you get married, you've got to deal with this stuff.

647
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,600
 Because if you are holding onto bitterness right now, you're gonna get into marriage,

648
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,580
 and you are gonna over and over and over again be deeply hurt by someone who you deeply love.

649
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,380
 And you have got to be able to forgive someone.

650
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,300
 Billy Graham said that what makes a great marriage is two great forgivers, it is so

651
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,180
 true, because it is one wound after the next, and choosing to forgive.

652
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,580
 I want this so badly for you, this is a huge part of my story.

653
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,480
 Anger, I entered Region about a year ago, because anger is something that has marked

654
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,980
 my life, that I struggle with anger.

655
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,100
 And that can not, oh it doesn't always look like outbursts and freaking out, but it looks

656
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,140
 like there's just an anger inside of me.

657
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,460
 And at some point I just said to my community, I think I need to go to Region, I think I

658
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,460
 need to address this, and it was by beginning to go, what is at the source and at the heart

659
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,760
 of why I'm angry?

660
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,340
 How is this anger impacting my life?

661
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,420
 And what is the solution to take in the steps?

662
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,900
 And the solution is the same for me as it is for you.

663
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,900
 You've got to forgive.

664
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,780
 Some of you have parents like me, that I had to forgive.

665
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,720
 Some of you have siblings, you have relationships, you have an old dating relationship.

666
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,940
 How long are you gonna carry that stuff?

667
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,400
 And the way that you can be free and tear down the wall is by choosing, I'm not gonna

668
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,580
 like that to find me anymore.

669
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,860
 I'm choosing to forgive.

670
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,920
 And that's the only way.

671
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,700
 And we can't see the walls in your life, but if we could, some of you guys are walled off

672
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
 in every direction.

673
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:55,780
 Ultimately, the call on your life is to choose to forgive like God forgave you.

674
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,580
 How did God forgive you?

675
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,340
 If you're a Christian, every single time that you've ever sinned, there was a brick as it

676
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,540
 were put between you and God himself.

677
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,140
 That every sin that you had created a division, created something that was unbridgeable for

678
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
 you.

679
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,100
 That every time that you've ever, every look at pornography, every time you've ever gotten

680
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,260
 wasted, every hit that you've ever taken, every time that you've lied to somebody, everything

681
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,260
 that you've ever misrepresented or slandered somebody or talked bad about somebody, every

682
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,120
 time that you've ever missed the mark of perfection or failed to do all that God calls you to,

683
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,840
 it was like a brick got put in the way of a relationship with God.

684
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,500
 And Jesus came in and the scripture tells us that he decided, I'm gonna choose to pour

685
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,380
 over the dividing wall and everything is gonna break down.

686
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,740
 And Jesus stepped in and gave us the perfect example of there is a path.

687
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,660
 And he took all of that forgiveness and he didn't just push it over, he took it on himself

688
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,860
 to give the perfect example.

689
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,500
 Whatever harms have been done against you, they pale in comparison to what you have done

690
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,940
 against God, what I have done against God.

691
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,980
 And the scripture says, holding onto this bitterness is going to hurt you.

692
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,420
 One person said that forgiveness and choosing to forgive is like unlocking a cage and unlocking

693
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,900
 a prisoner and discovering the prisoner was you.

694
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,660
 How long are you gonna be a prisoner?

695
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,900
 And the God who's there is calling you.

696
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,700
 If you want to experience freedom, it is possible.

697
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,460
 But there is only one way.

698
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:24,500
 By choosing, I'm releasing the demand for justice to God.

699
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,420
 He paid for it or that person's gonna pay for it for all of eternity and that's a far

700
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,940
 worse thing to experience than anything they could have ever done for me, eternity in hell.

701
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,260
 And I'm choosing to forgive or you can carry it and you can build the walls in your life.

702
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,700
 And the more you build, the more you're gonna build and the more people you're gonna shut

703
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,900
 off, including God himself.

704
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,580
 And the reason he's gonna feel distant at times is because he's saying there's distance

705
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,580
 in your relationships.

706
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,060
 And you're gonna feel distant with me as long as you're there.

707
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,900
 Let me pray.

708
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:00,980
 Father, thank you that the dividing wall of hostility you tore down with the cross, that

709
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:09,580
 you took every sin we've ever committed, every decision that we've ever made to worship ourselves,

710
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,580
 to pursue idols, to pursue worldly fleeting things, the approval of other people around

711
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:23,940
 us, and a million other ways that we have sinned against a perfect holy God, that you

712
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,940
 took all of those things and you forgive us, you paid for them all.

713
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,780
 I pray for tonight, specifically for men and women, for friends in the room who have never

714
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:38,060
 forgiven and even as I talk, they know I need to work, I need to forgive that person.

715
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,740
 I'm holding them at a distance and I've never really worked through this.

716
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,540
 And on the surface, nobody can really tell and I try to be nice, but I'm holding it against

717
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:52,140
 them, that right now, where you are or wherever they are, that you would meet them there and

718
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,700
 they would make the decision, I'm not gonna hold onto this anger anymore.

719
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
 I'm releasing it to you.

720
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,540
 I'm entrusting it to you, the God who paid for everything I've ever done, everything

721
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,980
 that's ever been done against me, and I want freedom.

722
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,100
 That they would have that.

723
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,140
 I pray that you would break up every couple in this room who wants to move forward without

724
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,780
 dealing with the anger, the bitterness, the resentment from the past, maybe even from

725
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,460
 the present, that they wouldn't take those things in and bring a marriage of people that

726
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,940
 are just constantly filled with bitterness and resentment towards one another.

727
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:35,460
 Would you fill our hearts with love and compassion towards one another and rid of all anger and

728
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,300
 malice and all of the things that don't honor you and do so by allowing us to forgive one

729
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,860
 another as you and Christ have forgiven us.

730
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,600
 We worship you now in song, amen.
