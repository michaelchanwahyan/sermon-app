 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:23,260
 Way.

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,640
 What's going on, porch?

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,320
 Hello, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston,

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,800
 and spread out every other place.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,320
 And jumping in online.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,440
 I'm Todd.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,560
 I get to hang out here at Watermark all the time,

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,000
 and I love diving in with my friends at the porch.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,560
 Thou shalt.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,320
 Man, you hear a series titled that,

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,480
 and you're kind of like, I don't know.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,640
 Really?

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
 You're going to tell me what to do?

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,920
 Well, I'm not.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,280
 But who the one is that is telling you what to do,

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
 once you understand that, it's going to change.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,160
 Thou shalt.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,480
 You ready for the first point?

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,120
 If you guys get this right, remember

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,520
 for the rest of the series, we're doing this tonight,

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
 next week, and then one more.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,320
 We're going to talk about the big 10, the 10 commandments.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,760
 And when we hear the word commands, we all genuflect.

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,520
 Like, come on, man.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,960
 Quit wearing me out.

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,160
 The reason I didn't follow God for a long time

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,840
 is I thought everything I wanted to do,

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,800
 he was going to slap my hand when I reached for it.

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,120
 And everything I didn't want to do,

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,720
 he was going to poke me in the back and drive me towards it.

32
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,280
 That was my view of God.

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,520
 And because my view of God was wrong, I was living life wrong.

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,400
 And when I came to finally understand,

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,240
 when I ran into people who know him, when I listened to him

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,520
 and quit telling him who I thought he was,

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,760
 it changed my life.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,920
 Here's the very first thing you need to understand.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,000
 Thou shalt is better understood as because I love you,

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,760
 I want you to know.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,920
 When you hear thou shalt, it's better understood

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,960
 because I love you.

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,640
 I want you to know this is the love of God,

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,840
 that we keep his commandments, and his commandments

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,080
 are not burdensome.

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,000
 Jesus said, now I've come that you might have life

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
 and have it abundantly.

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,880
 There is an enemy who lies to you about who God is,

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,600
 and he is going to steal your joy.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,960
 He's going to kill your hope.

51
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,080
 He's going to destroy your life.

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,640
 And so when God shows up and says, thou shalt,

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,560
 he is not looking to rip you off.

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,280
 He is looking to set you free.

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
 I don't know what you know about your Bible,

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
 but if you know much about it at all,

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
 you know it's broken up into two major categories,

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,000
 an old and a new testament.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,400
 Testament is just a fancy word for a covenant or a way

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,920
 that God is going to relate to us for a season and for time.

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,440
 Always, both in the old and the new covenant,

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,360
 you're going to find out that God is good,

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,320
 that God is gracious, that God provides for you what you can

64
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,520
 never earn on your own.

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,080
 And all he wants you to do is know him.

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,440
 In the Old Testament, you weren't

67
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,160
 saved because you kept a bunch of rules.

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
 And in the New Testament, you're not

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,360
 going to be saved because you keep a bunch of rules.

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,240
 You are going to be saved when you acknowledge

71
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,400
 the goodness of God and ask him to do for you what

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
 you can't do for yourself.

73
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
 It's called the gospel.

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
 It means good news.

75
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,960
 Let me say it to you again.

76
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,800
 When you hear thou shalt, if you hear anything less than,

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,520
 because I love you, I want you to understand this.

78
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,840
 You have bought a lie.

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,360
 Every now and then you come across a story that

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
 sticks with you for a long time.

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,080
 Can you tell that I've had this one for a while?

82
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,920
 I cut this out of the paper before.

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,880
 Maybe most of you--

84
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,600
 now, you were just now born.

85
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,720
 This is dated June 6, 1986.

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,760
 All right?

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,520
 Yeah, you go, wait, bro, are you allowed

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,020
 to take that from the Smithsonian Institute?

89
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,320
 That's probably what you're thinking right now.

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,360
 I've got permission, all right?

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
 So here we go.

92
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,960
 I want to read you.

93
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,760
 This is an article.

94
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,920
 The reason I ripped it out is because this young gal that I'm

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,360
 about to tell you about, you see a picture over here.

96
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,240
 This is June 16, 1986.

97
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,000
 It was in Sports Illustrated.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,680
 This was national news.

99
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 There was this young gal named Kathy Orangeby.

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,000
 I'm just going to show you this picture just for a second.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,160
 There's a track right there.

102
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,080
 That's where the NCAA national championships were being held.

103
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
 Then you see a little softball field, the baseball field,

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
 and then you see a little bridge right there

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,320
 on the way to the river.

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,080
 Remember that bridge.

107
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,640
 I'm going to read this article a little bit out of order.

108
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,640
 Here's what it says.

109
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,320
 "Friends knew Kathy-- Kathy Ormsby

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,840
 is who this article is about--

111
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,480
 friends knew Kathy Ormsby as a perfectionist who

112
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,320
 would be up running at 5 AM trying to make herself better.

113
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
 She led a charmed, all-American life.

114
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,000
 I guess so."

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,280
 OK, so let me just let you into my world a little bit.

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,800
 '86, I was done, all right?

117
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
 I'm out of college.

118
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,920
 I'm out of sports.

119
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,240
 I am adulting.

120
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,440
 We didn't even know what that word was at that time,

121
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,480
 but I was doing it, all right?

122
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,800
 We needed you to invent that for us.

123
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,200
 So I was right where you were, and I had just

124
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,480
 spent the first 21 years of my life trying to get places,

125
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,720
 to have things that were going to give me peace,

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
 to experience things that were going to give me joy,

127
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,400
 to find things that were going to make me the man.

128
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,040
 And I had run every gamut that men run,

129
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,320
 looking for those things.

130
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,280
 Now, my life, by grace, was interrupted a little bit

131
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,120
 before this.

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,600
 And I started to understand that thou shalt was not

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,840
 the way God started a bunch of rules

134
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,800
 that he was trying to oppress me with.

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,640
 I had just come to understand, not long before this,

136
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:05,400
 that thou shalt was better understood because I love you.

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,600
 I want you to know this.

138
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,960
 And I had been living underneath, really,

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,160
 throughout my college years, I had lived underneath,

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,280
 not thou shalt, but because I love you.

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,320
 And it changed my life.

142
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,040
 And I found a little girl who was the same age as me,

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,640
 little younger, in fact, who didn't find out what I found

144
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,680
 out when I did.

145
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,960
 And she ended up where I was going to end up.

146
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,200
 And I ripped it out of the paper.

147
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,320
 This is true about Kathy Ormsby.

148
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,760
 She got places I never had been.

149
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,840
 You get a Kathy Ormsby, says the article,

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,320
 but once in a lifetime.

151
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,800
 Said who?

152
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,680
 Ralph Robertson.

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,160
 Who's that?

154
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,840
 Well, he was the principal of Richmond, North Carolina,

155
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
 Senior High School.

156
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,600
 That's where Kathy went to high school,

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,520
 where she graduated number one in a class of 600

158
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,480
 with an unprecedented 99% average.

159
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,040
 She never made a B. That's a never made a B.

160
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
 That's the one thing that Kathy I had in common.

161
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:16,080
 But this girl right here, OK, this gal was number one.

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,560
 She had a 99% grade point average.

163
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,960
 She was the classic overachiever, her principal said.

164
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,960
 Track was just a sideline to what she was about.

165
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
 She was a pre-med student, and we

166
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,660
 knew she was going to do something great.

167
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,240
 12 years of school in Rockingham,

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,560
 Ormsby never received one grade lower than an A. All right,

169
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
 you say, that's fine.

170
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,640
 Good for you, Kathy.

171
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,680
 But you're a geek, right?

172
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,400
 You don't have any friends.

173
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,720
 You don't do anything but study.

174
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 Wrong.

175
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,200
 Wrong.

176
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,160
 This girl got better grades than me.

177
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,240
 There's a picture of her.

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,600
 She's better looking than me.

179
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,080
 It's a low bar right there.

180
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
 So far, it was not a big bar to get over,

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,560
 but she was ahead of me in both of these things.

182
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,100
 And she was a better athlete, an All-American, state champion.

183
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,420
 She set three state records.

184
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,060
 She didn't just win her year.

185
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,080
 She was the fastest female runner that

186
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,580
 ever lived in North Carolina.

187
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,580
 Just before she graduated, I'm like, yes, OK,

188
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,420
 but don't you hate that kid, right?

189
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,380
 She got-- never got a B. She won state championships,

190
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,660
 and she won three--

191
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,460
 I mean, she set three state records, right?

192
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,160
 Nobody likes Kathy, right?

193
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,000
 Listen to the next paragraph.

194
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,880
 "Just before she graduated in 1983,

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,920
 the mayors of five communities came together and did something

196
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,160
 they had never done before.

197
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,600
 They declared a day in honor of Kathy Ormsby.

198
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,920
 Buttons were given to high school students

199
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,760
 in five districts listing her accomplishments.

200
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,840
 There was an assembly in her honor and a proclamation

201
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,440
 for her to hang on a wall at her home.

202
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,100
 They had a stinking parade to celebrate this girl.

203
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,300
 OK, I don't know how popular you were in high school,

204
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,620
 but I'm guessing everybody wasn't giving your button.

205
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,180
 I don't think the mayors of five communities, all right,

206
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,020
 slapped some proclamation together and said,

207
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,460
 take this to college.

208
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,300
 We're going to miss you.

209
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,860
 Now, here's the problem with high school success, right?

210
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,140
 There's always another league.

211
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,740
 You got to go to the next thing.

212
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,460
 So Kathy got to college.

213
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,920
 Now we're about to see why we have to follow ourself

214
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,760
 off that track across the softball field,

215
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,680
 across the baseball field to a certain bridge.

216
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,920
 Because Kathy probably struggled when she was in college.

217
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,680
 Wrong.

218
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
 She was a Dean's List student who

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,640
 held the NCAA double women's record in the 10,000 meter

220
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,520
 race.

221
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,400
 She was an All-American athlete.

222
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,520
 She held the record fastest woman ever to run in college.

223
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,100
 Now, here's the lead paragraph.

224
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,400
 Kathy Ormsby, a record-setting distance runner

225
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,560
 from North Carolina State University whose life was

226
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,280
 one triumph after another, is paralyzed from the waist down

227
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,000
 and is not expected to walk again

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,480
 after she inexplicably jumped from a bridge Wednesday night

229
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,920
 during the NCAA championships in Indianapolis.

230
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,120
 She was expected to win.

231
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,760
 Ormsby, 21, jogged away from the stadium

232
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,240
 while in eighth place in the women's 10,000 meter race,

233
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,200
 she was favored to win.

234
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,760
 And she jumped off a bridge two blocks away,

235
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,880
 suffering multiple spinal fractures.

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,400
 She left the race with 3,400 meters to go.

237
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,240
 I mean, I read that.

238
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,360
 I didn't have a category for this.

239
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,760
 Even though I had come to understand

240
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,760
 that there was a God that was out there that loved me,

241
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
 I didn't--

242
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,280
 I just-- I thought, well, come on, man.

243
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,200
 God, I'm glad you love me.

244
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,960
 I'm glad you're thou shalls or really because I love you.

245
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,320
 I want you to know.

246
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,840
 But man, Kathy Ormsby, God, I mean, she--

247
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
 that girl is popular.

248
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,280
 That girl is famous.

249
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,320
 That girl is set up for the future.

250
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,360
 That girl is brilliant.

251
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,640
 And she did what?

252
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:07,200
 What Kathy Ormsby did is she came to the end of her idols.

253
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,160
 What Kathy Ormsby did is she realized that--

254
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,560
 that the gods that she was serving were no gods at all.

255
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,280
 Now, what's really interesting is Kathy Ormsby

256
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,600
 said all she wanted to do with her life was to please God.

257
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,640
 But here's the thing.

258
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,400
 She didn't understand the God who was pleased with her.

259
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,600
 She had in her mind's eye that if she didn't get great grades,

260
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
 if she didn't perform really well,

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,400
 if she wasn't going to always do the next amazing, most record

262
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,160
 setting thing, that she was disappointing God,

263
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,400
 disappointing others.

264
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,840
 And she was haunted by that.

265
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,280
 It's a phrase that I've often quoted.

266
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
 The phrase goes like this.

267
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,160
 It says, "The rich are infinitely better off

268
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,820
 than the poor.

269
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,280
 Because while the poor still think

270
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,740
 that money will buy them happiness, the rich know better."

271
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,560
 When I read that article, I thought,

272
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,720
 Kathy Ormsby is infinitely better off than me.

273
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,560
 See, in my athletic career, things

274
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,000
 happen that it didn't tend to fully trend the exact same way

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,360
 that Kathy's did.

276
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,280
 And it's just a fact that the girl in this room that

277
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,080
 wears that little size 2 dress, that has that long, flowing

278
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,160
 hair she never has to comb, whose complexion is just

279
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
 something, whose body is just shaped like it came right

280
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,640
 of a Lululemon catalog, who just has it all,

281
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,080
 she is infinitely better off than you who are frumpy.

282
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,560
 Because while you who come in this room look in a mirror

283
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,040
 and don't like what you see, that girl who looks in a mirror

284
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,500
 and sees what all the world says is going to make you happy,

285
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,560
 she knows better.

286
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:02,400
 That girl that's got a great boyfriend that's on her way,

287
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,960
 you know, maybe to having a big day where everybody celebrates

288
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,560
 her and focuses on her, and she's the bride,

289
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,520
 she's infinitely better off than some of you guys that

290
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,440
 have never had a date.

291
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,640
 Because while some of you think, if I could just

292
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
 get a guy to love me and pursue me,

293
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,400
 the girl who's already been down that road

294
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,560
 is starting to think, God, there's

295
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,840
 got to be a little bit more than this.

296
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,400
 I know we shared here, Tom Brady,

297
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,800
 after he won his third Super Bowl.

298
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,280
 He's 27 years old.

299
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,280
 60 minutes devoted an entire segment to him.

300
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,680
 And I just said, Tom, man, you know, you've got it all.

301
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,320
 It's all breaking your way.

302
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,880
 I quote.

303
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,440
 He says, I got to tell you this.

304
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,040
 I don't know why I had three Super Bowl rings.

305
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,960
 And I still feel like there's something out there that's

306
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,760
 greater than this.

307
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,480
 There has to be.

308
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,600
 And a lot of people say, hey, man, hey, Tom,

309
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 this is what it is, man.

310
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
 You've reached your goal, your dream.

311
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,560
 Your life has got it made.

312
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
 And he goes, me?

313
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,640
 I think, God, there's got to be more than this.

314
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,840
 And then the interviewer said, well, what is it?

315
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 What do you think it is?

316
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,200
 He goes, God, I wish I knew.

317
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,080
 God, I wish I knew.

318
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:07,840
 See, when you come across Tom Brady,

319
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,880
 when you come across Kathy Ormsby,

320
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,960
 and you still see them who have experienced what you have--

321
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,520
 this last week on Saturday night,

322
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,880
 I did the chapel for the Kansas City Chiefs.

323
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,600
 I'm sitting there with these guys, and I'm talking to them.

324
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,840
 And I could go right after them with this, you see?

325
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,640
 Because those guys have made it where

326
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,840
 every guy that's ever strapped on a helmet,

327
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,920
 ever boiled a mouthpiece, it's where they want to go.

328
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
 They want to be in that room.

329
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,520
 They want to be a guy that's a part of the NFL.

330
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
 And they are infinitely better off

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
 than some of you guys that are still

332
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,880
 exaggerating to the girls in this room

333
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,960
 about how great you were in high school.

334
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
 And if it weren't for an injury, you'd

335
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,720
 have been probably there, too.

336
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:52,760
 Because you think, man, if you just had that NFL alumni

337
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,840
 card in your pocket, then you'd have something.

338
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,800
 Those guys know better.

339
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,120
 Guess who else knows better?

340
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,580
 The one who says, hey, man, I don't

341
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,120
 mind if you break NCAA records.

342
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,840
 I love that you get good grades and use the mind.

343
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,300
 I've given you the fullness of your potential.

344
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,160
 You ought to take care of your body

345
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,720
 and have it be as useful and functioning and healthy

346
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
 and beautiful as it can be.

347
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,800
 But man, if you worship at that tree,

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,880
 it's not going to go well for you.

349
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,520
 Hey, man, if you've got what it takes to make it in the league,

350
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,680
 that's great, man.

351
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,100
 But if that's your God, it's just

352
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,000
 not going to serve you well.

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
 Can I give you another point?

354
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 Let me just give you this point.

355
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,540
 God always wants to give you everything

356
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,820
 you would have asked for if you knew everything he knows.

357
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,500
 When you hear thou shalt, he is not doing anything other

358
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,640
 but saying, because I love you, I want you to know this.

359
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,220
 Guys, this statement is so true.

360
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:06,520
 And it's just that what we think about when we think about God

361
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,680
 is the singular most important thing about us.

362
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,560
 And here's the deal, man.

363
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,880
 There's a liar, and all he wants to do

364
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,360
 is tell you that God doesn't have your best interest

365
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,860
 in mind.

366
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,960
 Thou shalt is a burden.

367
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
 Thou shalt is a beating.

368
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,400
 In fact, if you went and studied Satanism, you don't have to.

369
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,860
 I'm going to just kind of summarize it for you right here.

370
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,280
 You ready for Satanism for idiots?

371
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,640
 Here it comes, OK?

372
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,720
 You could sum up the entire Satanic Bible

373
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,920
 with what is commonly called the Thelemic Law.

374
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,160
 That means in Greek, will or intention.

375
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,920
 And here it comes.

376
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,200
 Do what thou wilt. Hey, do whatever you want, man.

377
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
 And the reason you've got to do whatever you want

378
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,160
 is because God, he doesn't have your best interest in mind.

379
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,320
 God isn't good.

380
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
 His word's not true.

381
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,600
 And disobeying him is not that big a deal.

382
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
 Do whatever you want.

383
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,880
 Bible says you can do whatever you want,

384
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,520
 but I'm just going to tell you that's the way of death.

385
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,160
 There's no life there.

386
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,080
 God always wants to give you everything

387
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,400
 he would ask for if you know everything that he knew.

388
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:30,120
 This is what it says in Exodus chapter 20.

389
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
 Says in verses 1 through 7, "Then God

390
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,200
 spoke all these words."

391
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,600
 Again, right now, what you thought

392
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,120
 about when I told you who spoke this

393
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,720
 is the most important thing about you.

394
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,960
 We spent a whole week on it last week.

395
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
 I am the Lord your God.

396
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
 Whether you want me to be or not, I am.

397
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
 So that's just not up for debate.

398
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,960
 Now, you can reject it.

399
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,240
 You can fight against me.

400
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,040
 You can make me out to be what I'm not.

401
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,240
 You can compare me to your old man who was abusive

402
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,160
 and abandoned you.

403
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,320
 Or you can listen to me.

404
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,360
 I am the Lord your God.

405
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,940
 And now here's what he's going to say.

406
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,560
 Who brought you out of the land of Egypt.

407
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,400
 We talked about this last week.

408
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
 I mean, what God's trying to say is, listen,

409
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
 I'm not here to put you into bondage.

410
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
 I am here to set you free.

411
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,440
 I like to say it this way.

412
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,320
 God isn't looking to catch you in your sin.

413
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,880
 He is looking to free you from the sin

414
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,660
 that has captured you.

415
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,760
 Now, I don't know what you think of God is up there

416
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,440
 and he's telling you, "Hey man, thou shalt.

417
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,420
 "And if you don't, I'm gonna catch you."

418
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,360
 No, that's not what he's gonna say.

419
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,320
 What he's saying is, listen, thou shalt,

420
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,920
 because I love you, I want you to know this.

421
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,200
 That if you don't do these things,

422
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,480
 you're gonna be captured and enslaved

423
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,360
 to various lusts and pleasures.

424
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,920
 You might even have some success.

425
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,040
 You might get good grades.

426
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,880
 You might be beautiful.

427
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,280
 You might have an NFL alumni card.

428
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,880
 You might be beautiful.

429
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,920
 You might have some ecstatic, emotional,

430
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
 and physical experiences.

431
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,560
 But you're not gonna have what you're looking for.

432
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:10,680
 There's a great line by a guy that had his own level

433
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,200
 of academic success and was a great philosopher and writer.

434
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,220
 He said this, "If we find ourselves with the desire

435
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,280
 "that nothing in this world can satisfy,"

436
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,740
 see Cathy Ormsby, see Tom Brady, see Todd Wagner.

437
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,960
 "The most probable explanation is that we were made

438
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,820
 "for another world.

439
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,700
 "If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it,

440
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,500
 "that doesn't prove that the universe is a fraud.

441
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,560
 "Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it,

442
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,020
 "but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing.

443
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,260
 "If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand,

444
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,380
 "never to despise or to be unthankful for

445
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,400
 "the earthly blessings that I have."

446
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,360
 In other words, earthly blessings hearken

447
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,520
 to fullness of life.

448
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,680
 They are a whisper of the satisfaction that is to come.

449
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,660
 But watch this, "But I also must never make the mistake

450
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,920
 "to mistake them for something else

451
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,560
 "of which they are only a kind of copy

452
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,400
 "or an echo or a mirage.

453
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,740
 "I must keep myself alive to the desire of my true country,

454
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,120
 "which I shall not find till after death."

455
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,640
 Now here's the thing, when God says, "Thou shalt,"

456
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,320
 what he's trying to do is to direct you

457
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,680
 back towards his kingdom's way.

458
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,880
 You were born a rebel in a rebel world,

459
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,440
 and the world keeps going away that seems right to them,

460
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,840
 but it's the way of death.

461
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,720
 Let me just give you one of the ways of the world.

462
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,160
 Here's one of the ways of the world.

463
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,640
 When the world doesn't think about God correctly,

464
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,040
 they are filled with anxiety and despair.

465
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
 When somebody's filled with anxiety or despair,

466
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,160
 we put them on meds.

467
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,200
 And we just try and numb them from their pain.

468
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
 And then we tweak meds the rest of their days.

469
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,440
 And sometimes their meds don't do what needs to be done,

470
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,380
 and they beat their wife and abuse their child.

471
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,040
 And sometimes that doesn't satisfy their anger

472
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,860
 and their need to lash out in pain,

473
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,720
 and so they grab a gun and they kill as many as they can

474
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,680
 in a town not far from where they live.

475
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,020
 (congregation laughing)

476
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,640
 You see, there's another way.

477
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,400
 And God is trying to help us and bring us to it.

478
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,300
 He loves us, and he wants us to know there is a better way.

479
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,320
 In Exodus 20, you guys need to understand

480
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,400
 that little verse right there in verse two,

481
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
 he says, "I brought you out of the land of Egypt."

482
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,560
 What God is telling him is,

483
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,400
 I'm about to tell you how to operate with me.

484
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,680
 And I am good.

485
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,880
 You were slaves.

486
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,820
 You had nothing.

487
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,580
 You were being abused.

488
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,320
 And you were sick and tired of being sick and tired,

489
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,340
 and so you cried out to me for a deliverer.

490
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,920
 And in my grace, I brought you one.

491
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:59,240
 And now, you have come to know that I am the one true God.

492
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,720
 So you may not know much about Exodus 1 through 19,

493
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,040
 but let me summarize it for you.

494
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,400
 There was a group of people that were slaves,

495
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,960
 that were abused, that were oppressed,

496
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,840
 that lived in a land where there were a multitude of gods,

497
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,580
 and those gods had been thoroughly mocked.

498
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,880
 They were proven to not be gods at all.

499
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,160
 The god of the Nile turned to blood.

500
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,880
 The god of frogs multiplied to the point of nuisance.

501
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,880
 Lice, gnats, flies, on and on and on and on.

502
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,480
 The god of the sky tortured them.

503
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 Every plague that happened in Exodus 1 through 19

504
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,280
 was a plague that mocked and took the gods of Egypt,

505
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,880
 the only gods the world knew that must be great

506
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,200
 because Egypt was the most powerful nation on earth,

507
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,360
 and absolutely brought sadness through them.

508
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,160
 God was showing there is no other god but me,

509
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,320
 and that is exactly what Moses tried to tell

510
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,380
 not just the Jews, but even Egypt.

511
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,440
 And he was telling Pharaoh, "Pharaoh, look, man,

512
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,800
 "you got a lot of power.

513
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,360
 "I'm glad you're Cathy Ormsby right now.

514
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,540
 "I'm glad you got your Pharaoh alumni card in your pocket.

515
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,500
 "But there's no life there for long,

516
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,520
 "because you must do business with me,

517
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,480
 "and I'm going to show you myself."

518
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,480
 And God showed the idols of Egypt were vain idols.

519
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,640
 And the people of Israel were set free

520
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,240
 from the bondage that they were in,

521
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,520
 and now God brought them out.

522
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
 Here's a note.

523
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,480
 The law was not given to redeem a people.

524
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,760
 This is so important.

525
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,680
 The law was given to a redeemed people.

526
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,120
 God never gives us the law so that by the law,

527
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,560
 we might be set free.

528
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,120
 God shows us that he is good, and then he says, "Thou shall."

529
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,640
 I love you.

530
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,240
 I have done for you what you can't do for yourself.

531
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,260
 If you want to continue to have a great life,

532
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,720
 don't do what you yourself want to do

533
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
 because you're a rebel boy in a rebel land.

534
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,440
 But by faith, you can trust in me,

535
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,140
 and not how you feel, and not what the world offers,

536
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,100
 and it will bless you.

537
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,960
 Do you know what happens at the end of the Old Testament?

538
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,380
 The very first words that God on earth speaks

539
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,600
 are these words, "Blessed."

540
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,400
 You know what that word means?

541
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,220
 It means happy.

542
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,060
 You want to be happy?

543
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,880
 Be poor in spirit.

544
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,720
 Don't be arrogant.

545
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
 Don't tell me where you're gonna find life.

546
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,160
 You're not gonna find life in those things.

547
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,640
 It's okay if you have relationships.

548
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
 I want you to have relationships.

549
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,880
 Here's how to have relationships at work.

550
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,360
 Thou shall do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.

551
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,720
 Thou shall not treat each other like sex toys.

552
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,440
 Thou shall, and on and on he goes,

553
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,180
 because he goes, "I don't want you to have moments

554
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,960
 "where you're pleased, but then you have poison

555
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,980
 "that ultimately breaks down your world

556
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,760
 "and the society of which you live."

557
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,300
 I love you.

558
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,520
 And God never tells you what to do

559
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,400
 until he's told you who he is.

560
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,440
 He starts by giving you a resume.

561
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,200
 I'm the God that set you free

562
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,760
 and brought you out of bondage.

563
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,720
 Romans 8, 32 says this.

564
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,080
 He who did not spare his own son,

565
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
 but delivered him up for us all,

566
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,400
 how will he not also with him freely give us all things?

567
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,440
 The argument of Paul is, hey, this God

568
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,020
 that brought us out of Egypt, of slavery and of judgment,

569
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,200
 if God will die for us, if that's his son

570
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,000
 and he demonstrated his love for me

571
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,020
 by dying on the cross, won't he thou shall me

572
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,280
 to other great things?

573
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,200
 Why wouldn't I listen to that God?

574
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,680
 And so with that as the setup, guys,

575
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
 we move to verse three.

576
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,400
 And here's what verse three says.

577
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,520
 It says, "You shall, thou shall

578
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
 "have no other gods before me."

579
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,800
 Why?

580
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,480
 Because what you think about when you think about God

581
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,040
 is the most important thing about you.

582
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,000
 God is only concerned with one thing.

583
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
 He's only concerned with one thing.

584
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,940
 By the way, do you know why Jesus died on the cross?

585
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,520
 It's not because he loves you.

586
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,760
 That's a secondary benefit.

587
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,520
 It's a secondary reason.

588
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,080
 The primary reason that God died on the cross

589
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,920
 is because he is holy and the wages of sin is death.

590
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,300
 And because God is love, he has to do

591
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,960
 what love demands that he does,

592
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,480
 and so love demands that he saves,

593
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,040
 but he's just and he can't save wicked people.

594
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,200
 So he had to appease his own eternal perfection

595
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,720
 by offering an eternally perfect sacrifice.

596
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 There's not a lot of those laying around.

597
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,200
 Enter the son of God,

598
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,240
 who does for you what cannot be done.

599
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,440
 It's not until Jesus demonstrates his love

600
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,180
 that he says, "Hey man, follow me."

601
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,160
 That's why Jesus came and reversed

602
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,400
 some of the effects of the fall.

603
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,660
 He would find lame people,

604
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,980
 which there was no lameness prior to us abandoning God.

605
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,520
 There was no sickness or death prior to us abandoning God.

606
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,200
 And what he does is he shows he has the power

607
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,240
 to reverse the effects of the curse.

608
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,480
 Who can do that except the one that is more powerful

609
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,600
 than the one that brought the curse?

610
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,920
 But God ultimately had to make sure

611
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,720
 that the payment was made.

612
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,960
 And so in order to establish his glory

613
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,680
 and to satisfy his justice,

614
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,140
 he demonstrated his holiness on a cross.

615
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,280
 And in the demonstration of his holiness

616
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,320
 for the purpose of saving you and me,

617
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,160
 we saw the demonstration of his love.

618
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,320
 And so he says, "Thou shalt."

619
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,220
 Thou shalt follow the God

620
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,280
 that has your best interest in mind,

621
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,040
 not the one who offers you

622
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,120
 what appears to be life-giving but is death.

623
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,200
 This is an illustration that whenever I give it,

624
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,040
 it kind of makes it,

625
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,860
 I'll tell you a little bit.

626
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,080
 It's an illustration that talks about how wolves

627
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,120
 would deal with, how Eskimos would deal with wolves

628
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,640
 that are ransacking and destroying their community.

629
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,480
 Do you know how they do that?

630
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,880
 What they do is they take a blade of,

631
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,560
 they take a very sharp knife and they slaughter an animal,

632
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,080
 okay, a beast of burden or an animal that they eat,

633
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,280
 and they dip it in that blood

634
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,680
 and they tie it to a stick in the ice

635
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,360
 and they let it freeze and they dip it in blood again

636
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,720
 and they do it again and again and again,

637
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,440
 let it freezing, layers and layers and layers

638
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,200
 and layers of blood until you've got a frozen blood popsicle

639
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 outside a knife blade, a very sharp knife blade.

640
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,120
 And then they'll take that and several others like them

641
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,600
 and they'll dip them one more time in flesh blood

642
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,040
 and they will go just outside their village

643
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,840
 and they will stick them in the ice.

644
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,400
 And then the scent comes to the wolves.

645
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,000
 And they hear there's blood there,

646
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,880
 it's easy prey and they will come and they will go

647
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
 and what do they find?

648
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,900
 I'll be dag numb, a blood popsicle.

649
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,580
 Now what happens when you start to lick the warm blood

650
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,620
 and underneath it, your warm tongue is melting

651
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,860
 the very next layer of frozen blood,

652
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,200
 so you get more and more blood,

653
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,900
 you're working yourself into a frenzy

654
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,600
 where as you are melting the frozen layers of blood,

655
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
 what's happening to your tongue?

656
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,920
 It's getting number and number and number

657
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,580
 until all of a sudden you lick through all the frozen blood

658
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,000
 and now you're licking the blade.

659
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,720
 And what happens when you lick a blade with a numb tongue?

660
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 You get more blood.

661
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,080
 And you just sit there and you just are consumed

662
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,360
 in the lust of your flesh.

663
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,280
 It sure seems life-giving.

664
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
 And what the enemy who comes to steal, kill and destroy

665
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,320
 is doing is he's putting all kinds of little idols,

666
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,640
 all kinds of little blood popsicles out there for you

667
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,600
 and say, "Come and get it."

668
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
 And at first you're like, "This is awesome."

669
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 You're like, "Here's Ralph."

670
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,440
 Mine's really good, you know?

671
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,040
 And next thing you know,

672
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,480
 you're talking like a slurred wolf, all right?

673
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,680
 And next thing you know, you're laying there dead.

674
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,120
 Doesn't that sound like lower Greenville?

675
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,400
 That sounds exactly like lower Greenville.

676
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,580
 Y'all get in there, go, "How's it going, Ed?"

677
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,220
 What did J.P. call it?

678
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,340
 Two-time Tuesday, whatever it was he called.

679
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
 I don't know.

680
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,260
 He's a two-time scoundrel 'til he found the Lord.

681
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,100
 That's what I know.

682
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,420
 (congregation laughing)

683
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,660
 Look, here's the thing, man.

684
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,500
 I wanna say it again.

685
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,860
 The law wasn't given to redeem you.

686
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,820
 The law was given to those that are already redeemed.

687
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,980
 That's what the scripture says, by the way.

688
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,580
 Let me just read it to you, Romans 3:20.

689
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,740
 "The works of the law were never there

690
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,820
 "in order that you might be justified."

691
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,700
 No, no, no.

692
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,700
 The law was there to show you that sin is real.

693
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,740
 And God's just saying, "Now look, here's the deal.

694
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,280
 "I'm holy, I don't jack around with what's not good

695
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,100
 "and true and beautiful and right.

696
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,220
 "This is not good and true and beautiful and right.

697
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,240
 "So stay away from it,

698
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,040
 "because I know it looks life-giving.

699
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,960
 "I know it's a popsicle, but it's gonna numb you

700
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,300
 "and it will destroy you.

701
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,300
 "Thou shall not lick blood popsicles."

702
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,640
 (congregation laughing)

703
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,680
 All God's saying to Israel,

704
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,820
 all He's saying to you and me is,

705
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,920
 "If you wanna get warm, man,

706
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,520
 "you gotta stand near the fire.

707
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,340
 "If you want peace, if you want joy, if you want life,

708
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,340
 "you've gotta get close and stay close to where life is."

709
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,580
 And He's just showing you, "I'm where life is."

710
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,600
 That was bondage, false God's bondage.

711
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,780
 By the way, what happened in Egypt?

712
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,600
 When you first got to Egypt, it was all,

713
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,920
 "Hey, man, you guys are awesome.

714
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,340
 "There are people from your tribe

715
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,300
 "that are telling us about the trouble that is to come.

716
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,240
 "Man, we love you, we bless you, we're jealous of you.

717
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,540
 "You're gonna be slaves."

718
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,340
 Right?

719
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,180
 Now watch this, I mentioned the word jealous,

720
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,380
 let's just deal with it.

721
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,860
 Second command, "Because I love you,

722
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,720
 "I don't want you to make yourself an idol

723
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,520
 "or any likeness of what is in heaven above

724
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,860
 "or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth.

725
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,660
 "You shall not worship them or serve them

726
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,900
 "for I, the Lord, your God, am a jealous God."

727
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,740
 Oh, really?

728
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,540
 Here's the problem with that.

729
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:49,260
 First Corinthians 13, four through seven says this,

730
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,260
 "Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous."

731
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,900
 I thought God was love.

732
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,060
 I mean, first John 4, it says God is love.

733
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,180
 And then in first Corinthians 13, four,

734
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,140
 it says love is patient, love is kind,

735
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,920
 love is not jealous, does not brag.

736
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,500
 I thought, Todd, you said the only thing

737
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,580
 God was really concerned about was His glory.

738
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,100
 All He wants to do is make His glory known.

739
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,860
 That's what He's really about.

740
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,940
 Here's the deal, follow me.

741
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,180
 There's two kinds of jealousy.

742
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,260
 There's the kind of jealousy that exists

743
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,380
 when you have a feeling of resentment for another person

744
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,940
 because of their success or their happiness

745
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,300
 or their accomplishments or the advantage they have over you.

746
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,300
 That is a jealousy that is one that will make you covetous.

747
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,620
 Like if I had what they had, what Kathy had,

748
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,060
 what Tyreek Hill had, what Dak has, I'd be happy.

749
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,360
 And I'm jealous of their success

750
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,400
 or I'm jealous of their relationship

751
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,300
 or the attention they get.

752
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,980
 There's another way that jealousy can be used though.

753
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,100
 Jealousy is not just used about resentment

754
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,740
 towards somebody who has what you think

755
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,600
 would give you life if you had it.

756
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,180
 It can also be an intolerance of unfaithfulness

757
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,860
 or of anything which threatens what is beautiful.

758
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,660
 And that is what it means in Exodus 20

759
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,140
 when it says that God is jealous for you.

760
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,780
 He doesn't want you to lick blood popsicles.

761
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,860
 He wants you to find life in deed.

762
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,220
 You see, this is how you can know

763
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,340
 if you've got a God-like jealousy

764
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:26,380
 is if you see somebody truly happy, if you rejoice.

765
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,580
 Or if you're like, I don't want you to be happy

766
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,200
 unless it makes me happy.

767
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,280
 See, God's not like that.

768
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,780
 What God says, and here's the deal,

769
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,060
 God is consumed.

770
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,320
 Love is not arrogant and does not boast.

771
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,560
 All God does is he says, look at me, look who I am,

772
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,400
 look who I am.

773
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,700
 Now why is God saying that?

774
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
 It's not because he's insecure

775
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,620
 and he doesn't need you to affirm who he is.

776
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,540
 He knows who he is.

777
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
 He's unchanging.

778
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,360
 What God's trying to let you do is see him

779
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,040
 because he knows if you see him

780
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,100
 that he is the one who delivers you from bondage.

781
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,980
 He's the one that gives good things

782
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,260
 in whom there is no variance or shifting shadow.

783
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,940
 You're going to want more of him

784
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,280
 and because he is life and light and love,

785
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,240
 you will then get what you can only get

786
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,700
 when you cozy up to him.

787
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,040
 Do you see that?

788
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,400
 God is not trying to establish his glory.

789
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,080
 God is trying to reveal his glory.

790
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,360
 What sin is is trying to numb you

791
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,560
 from the reality of the pain that is coming.

792
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,640
 He is a deceiver.

793
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,760
 He tells you there's life over here

794
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,200
 when in the end it is death.

795
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,900
 God says, "Die to your desires.

796
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,480
 "Follow me and you'll find life."

797
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,680
 So when God says, "You shall have no other God

798
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,900
 "because there is no other God,"

799
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,000
 you're going to be making it up.

800
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 You're going to serve a false God.

801
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,240
 False gods don't deliver you.

802
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,360
 False gods lead to what happened to Egypt.

803
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,340
 Don't make idols.

804
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,380
 Idols don't give life.

805
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,320
 I give life.

806
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,120
 There is no warmth besides that which is not a fire.

807
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,100
 And here's the truth of who I am.

808
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,420
 There's going to be consequences.

809
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,640
 I mean, I'm a good and gracious God.

810
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,020
 I'm patient and I'm kind.

811
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,740
 But sooner or later I'm going to let you have

812
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,900
 what you want if you want it

813
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,300
 because what God does is when you commit the only sin

814
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,500
 that really matters to God,

815
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,580
 in fact there's only one sin in the Bible

816
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,760
 that really matters, it's a primary sin.

817
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,660
 Everything else is not even so much a secondary sin.

818
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,980
 It's a judgment which ultimately comes

819
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,240
 because of the primary sin.

820
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,540
 What's the primary sin?

821
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,100
 When you reject the kindness, the goodness,

822
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,980
 and the love of the Father.

823
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:36,980
 And you make him out to be impetuous or needy or oppressive

824
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,180
 and therefore you give yourself permission

825
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,660
 to not serve him or want him or to follow him.

826
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,780
 Here's the truth.

827
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,000
 Most of us don't struggle with the idea that God exists.

828
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,020
 Every time we sin, all we're doing is confessing,

829
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,300
 I don't think you're good.

830
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,540
 And I think when you say thou shalt, the enemy's right,

831
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,300
 that you're not good, your word's not true,

832
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,380
 and disobeying you is not that big a deal.

833
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,260
 And because he's patient,

834
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,180
 it's always not that big a deal right away.

835
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,900
 But do not be deceived, God is not mocked.

836
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,700
 Let me just read you an amazing little section of scripture.

837
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,520
 It comes in Psalm 106.

838
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,980
 This is what it says, Psalm 106.

839
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,180
 Praise the Lord.

840
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,700
 In other words, this is the most important thing.

841
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,720
 Start by reminding yourself, oh give thanks to the Lord

842
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,060
 for he is good.

843
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,460
 God's loving kindness is everlasting, it never stops.

844
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,340
 There is no variance, no shifting shadow.

845
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,100
 Who can speak in the mighty deeds of the Lord?

846
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,900
 You know why we come together and gather corporately?

847
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,660
 Man, to remind ourself God is good.

848
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,500
 Because when you get out there,

849
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,300
 the world starts to say, he's not that good.

850
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,260
 He doesn't have your best interest in mind.

851
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,220
 Look at the mirror.

852
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,100
 Look at your job.

853
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,620
 What about your family of origin?

854
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,580
 What about that doctor's diagnosis?

855
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,020
 Who can speak in the mighty deeds of the Lord?

856
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,140
 Who can show forth all his praise?

857
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,580
 How blessed are those who keep justice,

858
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,600
 who practice righteousness at all times?

859
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,480
 All he's saying is those who know that thou shall

860
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,280
 is better understood is because God loves you

861
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,120
 and he's perfect.

862
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,160
 Verse four, remember me, oh Lord,

863
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,240
 in your favor towards your people.

864
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,860
 Visit me with your salvation,

865
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,120
 that I might see the prosperity of your chosen ones

866
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,660
 that walk in the way of life,

867
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,920
 that I might rejoice in the gladness of your nation,

868
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,500
 that I might glory with your inheritance.

869
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,120
 Some of you guys have been here longer

870
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,460
 and there is a rejoicing happening here at the porch

871
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,300
 of the nation of the redeemed millennials of Dallas, Texas,

872
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,280
 and Houston, and Fort Worth, and Joplin, and Tulsa,

873
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,380
 and all the other places.

874
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,540
 And there's something going on where you guys are going,

875
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,420
 this is the life.

876
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,900
 And there is a redeemed nation that's happening here

877
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,180
 among you, watch this.

878
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,380
 Verse six, Lord, we have sinned like our fathers.

879
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,600
 We've committed iniquity.

880
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,580
 We've behaved wickedly.

881
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,940
 Our fathers in Egypt didn't understand your wonders.

882
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,660
 They did not remember your abundant kindness.

883
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,820
 I mean, they weren't out of Egypt for a day

884
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,180
 and they started to say that you're a bad God to follow

885
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,260
 'cause it didn't look like there's any way

886
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:01,220
 you could deliver them from the next obstacle they faced.

887
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,380
 Even though you just plundered

888
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,940
 the most powerful nation on earth,

889
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,440
 there's a stinking Red Sea, and here comes that nation,

890
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,920
 and now they're angry.

891
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,680
 But you saved them for the sake of your name.

892
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,420
 That he might make his power known.

893
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,100
 He rebuked the Red Sea, it dried up,

894
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,180
 and he led them through the deeps,

895
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,020
 it's through the wilderness.

896
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,260
 So he saved them from the hand of the one who hated them.

897
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,140
 And he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

898
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,380
 The waters covered their adversaries.

899
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,700
 Not one of them was left.

900
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,100
 And so then they believed his words.

901
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,020
 Then they had a worship service.

902
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,120
 They go, what were we thinking?

903
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,820
 God is good, let's remind ourself of this.

904
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,680
 But man, does this sound like you?

905
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,080
 By Wednesday afternoon, they forgot his works.

906
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,860
 They didn't wait for his counsel.

907
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,360
 Hey, Lord, what shall we do?

908
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,060
 This good God who delivers us, what shall we do?

909
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,640
 But they craved intensely for what their flesh wanted

910
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,100
 and made sense in the wilderness,

911
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,500
 and they tempted God in the desert.

912
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,860
 So watch this, here goes verse 15.

913
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,660
 So he gave them their request.

914
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,900
 Blood popsicles for everybody.

915
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,880
 I wouldn't eat the blood popsicle.

916
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,820
 Thou shall not eat blood popsicles.

917
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,700
 The more you do it, the more you think

918
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,900
 it's not causing you problems,

919
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,460
 because the sentence, Ecclesiastes 8, 11 says,

920
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,660
 against an evil deed is not executed quickly,

921
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,420
 therefore the hearts of men among them

922
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,500
 suck harder on blood popsicles.

923
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,700
 It's a loose paraphrase.

924
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:33,140
 And they get numb, their conscience gets seared,

925
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,060
 and next thing you know, they go,

926
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
 I think I'm getting away from this.

927
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,960
 There's no God, what a joke.

928
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,100
 Bring on the party.

929
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,600
 And their tongue rages against the Lord.

930
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,340
 But then it says in verse 15,

931
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,700
 but he sent a wasting disease among them.

932
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,420
 If you've got a Bible with a little number there,

933
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,220
 a margin note, the literal translation is

934
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,140
 he sent leanness to their soul.

935
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,460
 Man, if there is not a beautiful description

936
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,620
 of what it really means to be an individual

937
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,800
 that is experiencing everything that the world says

938
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,720
 you should get so that you can be happy,

939
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,180
 and you've got it, and you're being interviewed

940
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,500
 by Steve Croft on 60 Minutes, and you just go,

941
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,940
 I don't know, man, there's a leanness in my soul.

942
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:25,460
 There's gotta be more than this,

943
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,300
 and I just don't know what it is.

944
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,580
 Thou shalt.

945
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,300
 Thou shalt have no other God before him,

946
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,700
 because he's the one true living God,

947
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,260
 and you're not going to find the life and the love

948
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,060
 and the light that you're looking for

949
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,180
 if you go anywhere else.

950
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,500
 I started this thing by talking a little bit

951
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,340
 about mental illness.

952
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,160
 Let me just end with this.

953
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,940
 It's a very familiar verse, but I want you to see

954
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,620
 why God is telling you thou shalt.

955
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,340
 It's Romans chapter 12, verse one, and here's the deal,

956
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,260
 guys, to summarize basically where we just were,

957
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,100
 here's the thing.

958
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,740
 You can pretend that there is no God for a while,

959
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,660
 but you won't be able to deny his word is true

960
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,020
 after a while.

961
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,980
 That leanness of your soul will get you.

962
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,500
 And some of you guys, in your arrogance,

963
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,780
 you might say, "Well, I don't feel lean, man.

964
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,900
 "I'm high on the hog right now.

965
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,860
 "That abortion, that doesn't bother me.

966
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,280
 "That sleeping around, I feel a little guilty,

967
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,060
 "but it also feels really good.

968
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,700
 "Dallas has given me enough, man.

969
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,220
 "I'm doing good, I'm doing good."

970
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,380
 If you like what you got, keep doing what you're doing.

971
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,460
 I'm going to warn you, if you keep doing what you're doing,

972
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,740
 you're not going to like what you got.

973
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,860
 And God is patient, and he is kind, but he is jealous.

974
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,820
 And just because the sentence against your little evil deed

975
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,780
 is not executed quickly, don't think for a second, Pharaoh,

976
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,020
 king of your own little Egypt, don't think for a second

977
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,900
 that you're going to mock him for long.

978
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,260
 And God's not mad at you, man.

979
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,300
 He's not mad at you.

980
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,740
 You're going to eventually experience

981
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,100
 that leanness to your soul.

982
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,260
 And so, he's just over there saying,

983
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,220
 "Hey, man, come on home."

984
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:08,440
 Romans 1 through 11 is all about the love of God,

985
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,940
 delivering you out of the bondage and slavery

986
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,100
 to sin and the flesh.

987
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,940
 You don't have to be there.

988
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,780
 He's shown you who he is.

989
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,140
 He's demonstrated his love for you,

990
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,980
 and that while you're still sinners, Christ died for you.

991
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,540
 "Therefore, thou shalt, I urge you, because I love you,

992
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,000
 "brothers and sisters, by the mercy of God,

993
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,380
 "who wants you to know how good he is.

994
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,700
 "I want you to present your bodies

995
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,500
 "as living and holy sacrifices, acceptable to God,

996
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,780
 "which is the right thing to do

997
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,020
 "when you see how good and wonderful God is.

998
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,440
 "You would run to him if you saw the glory of God,

999
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,440
 "if you knew that every good thing came from him,

1000
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,120
 "and no good thing does he withhold

1001
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,200
 "from those who love him.

1002
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,600
 "And in his presence is fullness of joy,

1003
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,680
 "and his right hand are pleasures forever.

1004
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,600
 "You would go, I'm in, I'm running to you.

1005
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,320
 "So you will not be conformed to the flesh and to the world,

1006
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,540
 "but you will be continually transformed

1007
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,240
 "as your mind is changed.

1008
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,960
 "You're no longer gonna be mentally ill."

1009
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,960
 This is mental illness.

1010
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,800
 God isn't good.

1011
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,920
 His word's not true.

1012
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,600
 Disobeying him's not that big a deal.

1013
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,220
 That is mental illness.

1014
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,960
 And because of that,

1015
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,360
 we abandon each other and families and relationships.

1016
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,420
 We numb ourself with drugs and medication.

1017
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,080
 We try and find life in the world.

1018
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
 We come from families where there's dysfunction,

1019
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,980
 and it messes with us, and it turns into a brain illness.

1020
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,440
 But why does God say this?

1021
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,800
 He says this so that you may prove,

1022
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,620
 come, come and listen to my vows, shalls,

1023
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,000
 so that you can prove with your own life

1024
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,480
 the sweetness of God's way,

1025
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,280
 so you can live righteously among the nations

1026
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
 and testify to them that God's way is good,

1027
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,480
 so that you, not by being good, can prove that you're good.

1028
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,660
 That's not what it says.

1029
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,040
 It says so you can experience what is good and acceptable

1030
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,240
 and perfect to the soul of man and woman.

1031
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,400
 Guys, I'll close with this.

1032
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,480
 I have known him now for 30-some-odd years,

1033
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,880
 and I have never one time, I got nothing,

1034
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,820
 I'm getting nothing from you for telling you this,

1035
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,740
 except there's never been one time

1036
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,580
 that I have followed in the goodness of the Lord's way

1037
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,580
 that I have regretted it.

1038
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,700
 I've missed out on sexual ecstasy for a season.

1039
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,320
 I've missed out on opportunities to titillate my flesh,

1040
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,700
 feather my bed, increase my worldly comfort.

1041
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,120
 But I can't tell you how many people

1042
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,920
 with more sexual relationships than I've ever had,

1043
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,480
 more money than I'll ever make,

1044
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,860
 more comfort than I could ever attain to,

1045
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,100
 are sitting at me and they go,

1046
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,140
 "Bro, you got what I don't got.

1047
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,500
 "There's a leanness in my soul that I don't see in you."

1048
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,420
 And I go, "I know, because for some crazy reason,

1049
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,860
 "God has let me see that thou shalt,"

1050
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,980
 means, Todd, because I love you,

1051
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,100
 come over here and be warmed by the glory of who I am.

1052
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,980
 And I don't care what you've done

1053
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,580
 or how long you've done it or how numb your tongue is,

1054
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,560
 come on back, man.

1055
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:04,360
 Get your numb conscience and get your frozen tongue

1056
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,900
 thawed out by the fire of God's love.

1057
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,920
 I'd love to have you here,

1058
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,560
 'cause just like I've been forgiven,

1059
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,180
 his forgiveness is for you.

1060
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,100
 Come on and show others the goodness of God's way.

1061
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,800
 Who wants some?

1062
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,360
 Let's go, people.

1063
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,480
 There's a world desperate to know the truth.

1064
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,760
 Father, I pray

1065
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,760
 that truth would come from this room right here,

1066
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,000
 and men and women would walk out of this room tonight

1067
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,560
 and the rooms that we're in, we're broadcasting to,

1068
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,160
 and they would just be heralds, Lord, of your goodness.

1069
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,700
 They would sing your song.

1070
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,860
 They would be Psalm 116 people,

1071
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,320
 not just in this next moment,

1072
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,320
 but Psalm 116, 106 people that would say,

1073
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,280
 "Praise the Lord, for he is good

1074
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,940
 "in all his ways of peace.

1075
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,240
 "With God, there is no variance or shifting shadow

1076
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,800
 "and even though there are hard days,

1077
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
 "we have trouble in the midst of them,

1078
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,500
 "and he's gonna make it right,

1079
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,420
 "and until then, we see that he has made us righteous

1080
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,100
 "through the sacrifice of his Son.

1081
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,740
 "Lord, thank you that you're thou shalt are

1082
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,860
 "because I love you.

1083
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,820
 "Give us the faith to walk in them.

1084
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,080
 "Lord, you don't give us a law to redeem us.

1085
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,120
 "You give us the law of truth

1086
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,640
 "that we might experience a restoration of the soul,

1087
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,340
 "an enlightenment of the eyes,

1088
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,020
 "that you might give us lives that are clean,

1089
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,080
 "that are free from the disease of sin.

1090
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,400
 "And so, Lord, we bow our hearts and we bend our knees,

1091
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,820
 "and we say, you are good and you are holy.

1092
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,620
 "We recognize you for who you are,

1093
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,500
 "and we say, let us walk in your ways

1094
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,140
 "because we believe there is life there."

1095
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,740
 If there is anybody in this room

1096
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,080
 that has not ever acknowledged your goodness

1097
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,260
 and that has been living in a way

1098
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,740
 that is a testimony to that,

1099
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,740
 I pray during this moment they would just repent,

1100
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,880
 they'd come home, they'd just say,

1101
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,820
 "Lord, if you're there and you're good, I wanna know you.

1102
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,440
 "If it's true that you can lead me out of the bondage

1103
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,460
 "of sin, I want peace."

1104
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,740
 And those of us that know, let us sing,

1105
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,560
 and let our lives sing all week long.

1106
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,020
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1107
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:16,860
 Thank you.
