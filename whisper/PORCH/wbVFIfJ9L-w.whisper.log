[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.020]   - Okay, hey porch, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.860]   Let's go.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.700]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.300]   Woo, man, it is so good to be with you.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.820]   I think I say this all the time.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.700]   It always catches me by such pleasant surprise
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.700]   that every Tuesday we walk in, we see this in our space.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.660]   Like I do not take for granted one minute
[00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.260]   that you would give us a little bit of your time
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.080]   on a Tuesday night.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.300]   I just say from the outset here, thank you.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.580]   We're really grateful that you would choose
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580]   to join us here at the porch.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.120]   If this is your very first time,
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.060]   we're in a series in the book of Colossians.
[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.180]   We kicked it off last week, so you're not far behind,
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.880]   but we're really eager to get back into it.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.220]   I've been prepping this sermon, getting ready for this night
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.980]   and I think God has something very, very,
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.580]   very specific for you.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.160]   And I mean you individually.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.380]   As I was praying, often it's easy to stand up here
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.020]   just to give y'all my perspective.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.060]   And look out into this room and to see a whole lot of faces,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.420]   a whole bunch of people.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.300]   And yet God does not see a crowd of people.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.460]   He sees each of you one by one.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.480]   And he has something very specifically prepared for you
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.700]   across a broad spectrum of spirituality tonight.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.200]   I believe that that's true.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.540]   So I'm really eager to get into this.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.420]   But first we've got to say hey
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.580]   to some of our Porch Live locations.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.800]   Okay, so y'all do a great job of helping me welcome
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.940]   Porch Live Dayton, Porch Live Des Moines,
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.460]   Porch Live Atlanta, Porch Live Fort Worth,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.860]   Porch Live Midland, all the Porch Live locations.
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.260]   We are so glad that you would be here with us as well.
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.960]   Well, if you've ever wondered if it's possible to fly
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.720]   without your driver's license on you,
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.860]   I can tell you from personal experience, it is.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.220]   I just would not recommend it.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.380]   A few years ago, I was flying to speak at a retreat
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.540]   where I realized I didn't have my wallet on me.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.900]   I'd made the drive to the airport,
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.180]   I had waited in the security line,
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.300]   I had finally approached the TSA desk.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.180]   And to my horror, I realized I didn't have
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.140]   my driver's license.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.480]   I thought this is terrible.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.420]   Like how am I going to get on this plane?
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.460]   I've got to get there by tonight.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.460]   Like I have to speak this evening to a group of students.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.220]   And so if I'm not able to get on this flight,
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.380]   I am in huge trouble.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.740]   And the fact that I don't have any sort of verification,
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.860]   it's complicating my reality.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.700]   And so I walk up to the TSA desk
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.740]   and I do the only sensible thing.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.480]   I look at Wanda was her name.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.660]   And I said, "Ms. Wanda,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.580]   "I don't have my driver's license on me.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.660]   "Please have mercy.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.820]   "Is there anything you can do?"
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.320]   To which she, and I'll give her credit,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.180]   very politely responded, "I'm so sorry, sir.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.120]   "You will in fact have to rebook."
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.180]   There were no other flights that day.
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.900]   So rebooking is not an option.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.940]   Like I cannot rebook a flight because again,
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.740]   I've got to get there by that evening
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.980]   to preach to these students.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.220]   And it was like, "Oh, well just go home
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.340]   "and get your driver's license."
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.180]   Like no big deal, man.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.660]   Like just hop in the car.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.860]   I lived in Houston, Texas.
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.320]   Houston is widely spread out at the time.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.940]   And so it's like a 45, 50 minute drive,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.020]   one way to get my license.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.540]   And my flight is boarding within an hour.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.500]   So I don't have time to do that.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.880]   And so I double down, I lean in to Ms. Wanda
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.980]   and I'm like, "Hold on,
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.200]   "let me just really explain to you what's happening here.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.840]   "You know, I'm a pastor
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.640]   "and I'm traveling to speak to some students
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.660]   "and they're not just any students,
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.060]   "they're troubled teens, you know,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.100]   "and they're not just troubled teens.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.580]   "You know, this is happening this weekend.
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.020]   "It's not just any weekend.
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.640]   "This is actually my birthday weekend
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.700]   "and I'm so sacrificial
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.040]   "and I'm gonna be making this trip
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.500]   "in order to speak to these students.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.040]   "Is there anything you can do?"
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.680]   And finally, there's a chink in the armor
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.860]   and she looks at me and says,
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.480]   "Well, do you have any other identification
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.680]   "you can provide me with?
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.540]   "Any other proof that you are who you say you are?
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.880]   "That you're not walking in
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.420]   "with somebody else's boarding pass,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.200]   "but you are in fact the genuine article of Kylan Perry?"
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.740]   I keep a clean backpack, people.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.580]   Like I'm not walking around with a bunch of stuff
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.660]   just floating in my bag
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.900]   that I could pull out and identify myself with.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.780]   And nothing on my phone works.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.420]   Like I'm not allowed to just pull up my Facebook
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.380]   or pull up my Instagram
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.580]   or pull up a sermon of me preaching at the porch.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.740]   Like that doesn't work for her
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.660]   even though it's my name and my face in real time.
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.820]   None of that stuff works.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.980]   I've got to provide something in print for her
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.640]   with my name that has some sense of veracity behind it.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.020]   And wouldn't you know, there is a God.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.300]   Because in my bag,
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.260]   I had a government issued document
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.500]   that I'd received that week at the office.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.140]   I had a W-2 in my possession.
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.180]   Never did I think I would thank God for taxes,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.260]   but I had my W-2, I showed it to Wanda.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.860]   And after a few more questions,
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.380]   some very extensive screening,
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.020]   they cleared me to board my flight.
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.620]   Why?
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.460]   Because I had proof of my identity.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.700]   I had proof of my identity.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.900]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.140]   Because tonight, Paul is going to tell
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.340]   this group of young believers,
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.580]   the Church of Colossae,
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.060]   which we were introduced to last week.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.900]   He's going to tell them,
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.260]   "Hey, there's a way for you to verify
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.540]   that you are who you say you are in Christ.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.460]   There's some proof that we can point to
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.560]   that will add a sense of veracity
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.020]   that you are who you say you are."
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.060]   Like just like TSA needed evidence to verify
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.740]   that I was Kylan Perry,
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.660]   Paul's going to look at us and say,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.420]   "Hey, there is some proof that you are in Christ Jesus."
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.260]   It's sort of a diagnostic for the believer,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.940]   the passage we're looking at tonight.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.920]   Just like your teacher in grade school, high school,
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.420]   would show you an answer key
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.980]   that you could check your work against
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.480]   and see where you were right and where you were wrong.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.380]   That's what this passage does.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.360]   It's an answer key for the Christian life in a sense.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.160]   But before we jump into the proof,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.880]   we've got to look at some of the precursors to that proof.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.920]   Like Paul's going to show us,
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   "Hey, there's a bunch of effect
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.120]   by way of you walking with Jesus,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.880]   but there's something that we need to understand
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.920]   before we get to that effect.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.080]   We've got to understand the cause for all of that proof,
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.840]   for all of that evidence."
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.800]   And that's where he starts.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.640]   If you've got a Bible,
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.800]   Colossians chapter one is where we're at.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.920]   If you don't have a copy of the scripture, don't worry.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.960]   It's on the screens behind me.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.800]   You can just track along with us as it pops up.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.880]   And here's what Paul says.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.320]   We're going to pick it up in verse nine.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.780]   And so from the day we heard,
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.840]   from the day we heard what Paul?
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.400]   Of everything that we talked about last week,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.680]   that he's writing to a group of young believers,
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.640]   just like yourself.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.760]   And he's saying, "Hey, we've heard
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.640]   that you have a splendid reputation,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.440]   that you have all the markings of Christlikeness
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.260]   in your life.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.160]   We've heard about it."
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.080]   Like Paul, he's never met this group of believers.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.920]   He's heard about it by way of a guy named Epaphras,
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.720]   a local to Colossae that was in Ephesus
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.800]   when Paul was preaching.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.720]   And so he's heard the good report of their behavior,
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.280]   of their belief, which precedes that behavior.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.420]   And so he's saying, "Hey, from the day we heard all of that,
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.200]   that you've got a good reputation,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.660]   you look everything like a believer,
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.680]   we've not ceased to pray for you,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.200]   asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.160]   in all spiritual wisdom and understanding."
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.200]   We said this last week, but just to catch you up,
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.000]   if this is your very first time,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.880]   the big idea of the book of Colossians
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.120]   is that clarity of Christ produces maturity in life.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.400]   Clarity of Christ produces maturity in life,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.080]   that if you want to progress as a person,
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.280]   if you want to grow as an individual,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.240]   if you want to move forward in society,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.960]   if you want to be the best you, you can be.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.700]   The way to do it is with Jesus.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.100]   It's by getting the clearest vision of him possible,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.560]   which would have been really important to these believers
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.140]   because they live at a time and in a context
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.360]   where all manner of false teaching
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.040]   was beginning to pervade their midst and tell them,
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.880]   "No, no, no, you don't need to follow Jesus.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.980]   You need to do this instead.
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.820]   Learn this new moral ethic.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.280]   Worship this different type of spirituality.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.040]   Learn this new level of superior knowledge.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.160]   Ascend intellectually."
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.520]   But Paul's saying, "No, no, no, no,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.180]   like you don't need all of that.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.720]   You need knowledge of Christ,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.180]   but not just any kind of knowledge,
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.420]   not just general knowledge.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.500]   You need to be filled with knowledge."
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.160]   Like instead of looking outside of Christ
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.480]   for greater fullness, he's praying,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   "Look deeper into Christ
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.120]   for all of the fullness that you want."
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.720]   Do you want to grow?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.760]   Are you in the room right now and you're like, "I do.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   Kyle and I want to be mature."
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.760]   It's with Jesus.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.360]   That's how you grow.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.960]   That's how you move forward.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.300]   That's how you advance as a person,
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.200]   superior human existence.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.440]   It doesn't exist somewhere else.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.460]   It's with Him.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.960]   And Paul is so adamant about helping us catch
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.200]   that this is true,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.640]   that he references the idea of fullness
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.480]   six times in six verses.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.180]   Fill you with knowledge,
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.640]   all wisdom and understanding in every way,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.960]   in every good work,
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.960]   strengthened with all power, giving, joy, full things.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.020]   Why does he do this?
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.820]   Because he wants there to be no mistake.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:13.120]   In Jesus, we have access to all the knowledge of God
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.960]   we could ever want.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.160]   All the fullness of the deity,
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.160]   the climax of spiritual experience,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.100]   whatever existence you're hoping will be ahead of you.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.120]   As great as that is, it's better with Him.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.320]   That's what he's saying.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.200]   And yet,
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.420]   what the world is saying,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.860]   is Jesus alone will not satisfy.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:38.020]   Now you need to look elsewhere.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.620]   Like, God's fine,
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:46.900]   but is He really the only author of all truth?
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.260]   Now just define your own, man.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.420]   What's your truth?
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.300]   You pick it for yourself.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.880]   Or the world's looking at Jesus and saying,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.080]   man, the sexual ethic of Christianity is so lame.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.860]   You can just do whatever you prefer instead.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.300]   Or the world is looking at Jesus
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.840]   in the way that He articulates
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.020]   God's grand design for all things.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.860]   And it says,
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.580]   I think actually,
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.820]   I'm gonna redefine my reality
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.740]   and assume whatever gender I want.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.020]   You see, the world wants you to grab onto the lie
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.940]   that satisfaction is not found in God alone.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.080]   You'll never find it in Him alone.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.540]   But Paul, by the working of the Holy Spirit
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.820]   wants you to know,
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.820]   satisfaction will only ever be found in God alone.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.440]   That's what he's pointing to.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.740]   That's what he wants us
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.940]   and these believers in Colossae to grasp.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.180]   And it's not just a general knowledge,
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.540]   but it's a specific knowledge.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.880]   He wants them to be filled with all knowledge.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.700]   In what ways?
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.060]   In all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.200]   Which I don't know about you,
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.740]   but when I read that, felt confusing.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.740]   Thank you, Paul, for just using more Christian language.
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.580]   Right?
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.620]   All spiritual wisdom and understanding?
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.300]   Like, are you just saying the same thing?
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.100]   It feels like he's saying the same thing,
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.580]   but there's some nuance between these two ideas.
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.580]   There is a difference if you look at the original Greek
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.340]   and you try to understand what the words
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.540]   for understanding and wisdom actually mean.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:26.260]   So the word for understanding in Greek is synaesis.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.380]   Say synaesis with me.
[00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.220]   Synaesis.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.380]   Congratulations.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.080]   You can speak another language, you know?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.060]   When we read the word synaesis,
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.580]   synaesis means to put the facts together.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.460]   That's what it means.
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.780]   Understanding, putting the facts together.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.060]   It's comprehension of an idea that I've learned something
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.120]   and I comprehend it fully.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.340]   It's book smarts.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.160]   But wisdom is sophia.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.100]   Sophia.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.260]   If you're Sophia in here,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.100]   according to Greek, your name means wisdom.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.780]   Sophia.
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.420]   Wisdom is to live with skill.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.420]   So if understanding synaesis means to comprehend an idea,
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:15.500]   wisdom, sophia, is the application of that idea.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.920]   It's street smarts.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.380]   One is book smarts.
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.940]   One is street smarts.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.420]   They go together.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.800]   They're two sisters tied at the hip.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.420]   They have to move together as we consider
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.740]   what God's revealing about himself in the scriptures.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.700]   So just a few years ago, Brooke and I,
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.180]   we took a trip to Italy.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.240]   And we knew that over the course of a couple of weeks,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.040]   we were gonna be traveling during our time there,
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.680]   which meant that I need to get really familiar
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.800]   with Italian traffic law.
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.360]   So what did I do?
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.500]   As I was applying for an international driver's license,
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.720]   I knew that what I needed is I needed to
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   gain a basic understanding of how Italy navigated its roads.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.880]   And so I did a thorough Google search
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.480]   and took good notes and tried to understand
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.960]   as much as possible.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.900]   And then I applied that knowledge
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.900]   as we drove around the country of Italy.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:18.040]   I had understanding and I had wisdom
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.980]   for that understanding.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.240]   I had comprehension of an idea
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.600]   and then I had application of that idea
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.880]   as we drove around Rome,
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.320]   which if you've ever done, it's terrifying.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.880]   Paul is saying this.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.120]   He's saying that we need to comprehend who God is
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.720]   and we need to apply our lives accordingly.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.120]   How do you do this?
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.360]   How do you comprehend who God is
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.000]   and then apply your life accordingly?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.960]   Well, there's a bunch of different ways you could do it.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.560]   But here's the simplest.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.160]   So if you're like me,
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.900]   I'm gonna give it to you as plain as possible.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.320]   This is the way that you grow in the knowledge of God
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.840]   and you apply that knowledge.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.260]   You look to Jesus.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.720]   You look to Jesus.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   Jesus Christ is the essence of God's character
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.200]   and he is the expression of God's nature.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.840]   You look to him, you imitate his example,
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.160]   which is really kind of God
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.760]   because this is the basic way
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.560]   by which all children actually learn to grow.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.040]   It's through observational learning,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.640]   according to psychologists,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.280]   that children, even infants, they look at other people,
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.120]   they look at their parents or they look at their siblings
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.800]   and as they observe the world around them,
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.720]   they pick up cues of what they themselves are supposed to do.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.980]   So if you're here and you're like, man, I'm immature.
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.560]   How do I grow like a child?
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.920]   Observe Jesus.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.520]   Get your eyes on him.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.560]   Get your eyes fixed on him.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.640]   Observe the way he lives and speaks
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.720]   and moves and conducts himself.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.960]   Like just take notes as you see in the gospels,
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.660]   the way that he interacts with people
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.920]   or the things that he says or those abnormalities,
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.000]   which feel really out of character for regular society.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.520]   Take note of all of it
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.000]   because he's setting an example for you to follow after.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.440]   He wants you to see in him knowledge
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.320]   and understanding of God
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.440]   and a wisdom to apply that knowledge.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.480]   So say you do this.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.080]   How do you know if you're growing?
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.640]   What proof do you have?
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.480]   Well, that's where Paul goes next.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.920]   And this is the diagnostic portion of the passage
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.280]   that I was telling you about.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.800]   He's going to give us four proofs for the Christian life.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   So here's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.640]   If you're in the room tonight
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.200]   and you consider yourself a believer,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.700]   then this is a really important passage for you to consider
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.840]   because it's going to take your life
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   and it's going to say, okay, man,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.680]   if this is what you claim to be,
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.980]   then this is what you should look like.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.100]   It was convicting for me to read through.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.880]   And so I would just ask you, if you follow Christ,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   make yourself available to the work
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.120]   of the Holy Spirit's conviction
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.920]   as we work through the rest of this,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.400]   because I think it will bring to you
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.680]   what it's brought to me,
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.320]   enlightenment of what I need to work on,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.260]   of where I need to direct my time and my attention
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.940]   and where God wants to grow me.
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.300]   I want to grow.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.620]   Do you?
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.340]   Well, then let's read.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.500]   Pick it up in verse 10.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.300]   So be filled with all knowledge.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.020]   So as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord,
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.980]   fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.660]   and increasing in the knowledge of God,
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.620]   be strengthened with all power
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.140]   according to his glorious might
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.980]   for all endurance and patience with joy,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.060]   giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.160]   to share in the inheritance, the saints of light.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.160]   So what proof do we have that we're growing in Christ?
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.940]   Well, the very first thing that Paul points to
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.540]   is you try to walk in a manner worthy of Christ.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.880]   The first proof you should see is that you're bearing fruit.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.720]   That's it.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.960]   Proof number one is you bear fruit.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.720]   I think it's really helpful that Paul
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.520]   uses agrarian language
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.040]   and he talks about fruit bearing as an illustration here
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.440]   because the fruitfulness of a tree
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.840]   directly correlates to the health of that tree.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.600]   So you've heard me say this before,
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.280]   but I grew up on a farm.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.780]   My dad and I, we'd go out in the wintertime,
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.360]   we would cut firewood.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.320]   When we would walk through the woods together
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.520]   and we would assess the trees around us,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.440]   we would try to identify which trees were alive
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.160]   and which trees were dead.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.920]   How would we identify which was which?
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.340]   We would look for signs of life.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.640]   Signs of life.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   The trees are green.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.440]   The bark is fresh.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.560]   Even the smell of it is alive.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.560]   Whereas on the other hand,
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.440]   if a tree's dying or it's diseased,
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.920]   it has signs of death and disease.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.960]   It shows its decay.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.280]   You see the leaves are withering
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.240]   and the bark is falling
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.000]   and the core is chalky.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.580]   Like you can identify very quickly
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.040]   what trees are alive and which are dead.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.560]   You see, if something is dead,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.600]   then something is wrong.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.680]   The Christian life is similar.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.480]   Your spiritual fruit will speak to your spiritual health.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.200]   Your spiritual fruit will speak to your spiritual health.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.120]   Galatians 5.22, very famous, it says,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.560]   "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.860]   "patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.400]   "general self-control.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.280]   "Against such things there is no law."
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.620]   When you look at your life,
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.760]   let me just put the question in front of you.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.060]   What fruit do you see?
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.480]   When you look at your life,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.960]   what fruit do you see?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.920]   Listen to me on this.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:48.500]   If you see an absence of fruit in your life,
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:55.420]   Christian, the issue is not with your ability to bear fruit.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.520]   The issue is with your proximity to God.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.680]   That's the issue.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.160]   John 15.5 tells us, "I am the vine."
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.320]   This is Jesus Christ speaking.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.560]   "I am the vine.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.580]   "You are the branches.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.760]   "Whoever abides in me and I in him,
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.640]   "he, she it is that bears much fruit.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.560]   "For apart from me, you can do nothing."
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.560]   Which just means that without Jesus,
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   fruit bearing is impossible.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.400]   But with Jesus, fruit bearing is inevitable.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.480]   Without Jesus, fruit bearing is impossible.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.020]   You cannot do it on your own.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.400]   But with Jesus, it's inevitable.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   It's gonna happen.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.320]   You plug your computer in,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.360]   or you plug your phone in,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.500]   overnight, what happens?
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.080]   It automatically updates.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.040]   Plug yourself into the Lord.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.780]   Like connect yourself to Christ.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.400]   Automatically update.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.460]   Synced in with the Spirit.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.420]   Move forward with him.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.020]   Bear good fruit.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.740]   Look like Christ in his Spirit's fruit.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.980]   But you gotta stay with him.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.900]   You see, we cannot control the outcomes
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.740]   of our spirituality,
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.020]   but we can control the inputs for our spirituality.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.740]   That's why Paul talks about good works right here.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.620]   Like good works.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.620]   He's not saying, "Hey, you need to moralistically ascend.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.420]   "You gotta be a better person.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.680]   "You gotta have eyes to see everything good out there
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.520]   "that you can do."
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.660]   No, that would be exhausting.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.180]   No, he's saying, "No, is there good work in your life?"
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.740]   Because those are the inputs you control.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.660]   Like that's what it looks like.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.920]   You cannot control the outputs.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.940]   You cannot control the fruit,
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.980]   but you can control the inputs.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.140]   And those are the good works
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.900]   that you get the pleasure of walking in.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.740]   You see, in verse seven,
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.100]   Paul doesn't praise the Colossians
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.460]   simply because they've learned the truth from Epaphras.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.900]   "Hey guys, you got it, awesome."
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.020]   No, he rejoices that their faith
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.300]   has produced concrete results.
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.700]   Their faith produced concrete results.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.700]   Their belief has led to a right and appropriate behavior.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.180]   But it's not one without the other.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.520]   It goes together.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.380]   Scholars, they call this the principle
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.580]   of orthodoxy and orthopraxy.
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.060]   That's how the book of Colossians is set up.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.860]   First half, all orthodoxy.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.820]   Do you know the right things?
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.340]   And the second half, orthopraxy.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.780]   Do you do the right things?
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.620]   They go together.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.700]   You cannot evaluate one without the other.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.500]   And yet, here's the thing.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.700]   Our culture does not agree with this sort of mentality
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.060]   because our culture is plagued
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.580]   with a low information to action ratio.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.340]   Like we are regularly accustomed what is good to do,
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.540]   but we are also regularly accustomed
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.580]   to do nothing good with that information.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:47.060]   So a lot of you, just gonna say this honestly,
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.700]   as I visited with the fellas,
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.340]   you know how to date.
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.400]   Then why won't you initiate with her?
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.420]   You know you should confess.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.760]   So why then are you hiding sin?
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.100]   You know you should pray.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.320]   Why then are our prayer gatherings empty?
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.540]   Like we know what to do,
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.700]   but we're unwilling to actually do it.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.500]   You know, man, I should apologize to that person.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.300]   I should seek their forgiveness.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.060]   But man, I just don't wanna give them the satisfaction.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.060]   We do this all the time.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.720]   Too often we're all orthodoxy,
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.220]   and we're no orthopraxy.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.060]   We know what to do, but we fail to do it.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.660]   Just a couple of weeks ago, Brooke and I,
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.500]   we were driving home late from dinner one evening
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.220]   with my sister and her family.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.420]   I've told some of you this story already,
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.380]   but we were driving home, and it was late in the evening,
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.860]   and right as we hit our exit ramp,
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.580]   we're just a few blocks from the house,
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.660]   we're pulling off, and we pass a young lady
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.580]   whose car has a flat tire.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.040]   And so you know, I see it, and I sinfully just like
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.940]   push the gas pedal down, like we gotta get home, man.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.980]   You know, like maybe Brooke won't see it.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:07.560]   But she did, and I married a really godly woman.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.820]   And so she said, "Hold on, like we gotta go back,
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.660]   "and we gotta help."
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.180]   So we turn the car around, we back up.
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.740]   At 10.45 at night, I walk up and introduce myself
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.660]   to this young lady.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.940]   I'm like, "Hey, my name's Kylan, you got a flat tire.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.080]   "Can I help in any way?
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.420]   "I work in ministry, I'm a pastor, you know,
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.320]   "I'm safe, don't worry.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   "Can I help?
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.780]   "Is there anything I can do?"
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.220]   And so we take some time, and we work on this flat tire,
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.300]   and we change it out, and get her on the road.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.180]   She drives home, she's really grateful.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.500]   It was awesome, it was a really good thing to do.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.340]   I was really grateful.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.680]   I went home tired, but I went home full,
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.080]   which is a good measure of the Christian life.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.220]   Here's what's crazy.
[00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:01.260]   The next morning comes along, and my full anticipation
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.860]   is that, man, we did a good thing last night,
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.460]   and that's the extent of it, you know?
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.660]   Like, we helped someone, we changed their tire,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.220]   they drove off into the sunset, amazing!
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.940]   Like, great evening, my wife is happy.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.380]   This worked out really well.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.940]   That would've been enough.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.600]   But God knew I'd preach this, and I'd see you.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.820]   And so what he decided to do was take the story even further
[00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.980]   because I received a text from this young lady.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.100]   She texted my wife and I,
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.380]   because we had just given her our number to say,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.240]   "Hey, let us know if you have any trouble getting home."
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.900]   So she texts us the next morning, and she says,
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.980]   "Hey, thank you so much for last night.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.780]   "I'm not sure what I would've done."
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:43.500]   You know, it's crazy.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.780]   I was thinking about it.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.820]   I was at the point of giving up on God.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.980]   But you pulling over and helping me
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.440]   helped me to realize he's not giving up on me.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.340]   We are not applauding my good work.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.380]   We are applauding the faithfulness of God
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.900]   to see that woman and move into her story.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.580]   That's what we're applauding here.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.020]   But here's why I tell all of this to you,
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.180]   for very seldomly will I put myself up as an example.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.380]   I hope you gather from the fact
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.300]   that I didn't necessarily want to stop.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:28.900]   I put that in front of you because I just want you to know
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.800]   I did not know the good fruit, but I saw the good work,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.780]   and I stepped into it, and that would've been enough.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.900]   But God gave me the good kindness of showing me
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.100]   exactly what he wanted to do that night.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.860]   And someone's story's different because of it.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.500]   Friends, you cannot produce good fruit
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.860]   if you avoid good works.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.420]   You cannot produce good fruit if you avoid good works.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.340]   We were not made to live like that.
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.180]   Ephesians 2:10 tells us, "For we are his workmanship."
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.620]   He's worked on us.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.300]   You are his craftsmanship.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.900]   He's taken you out of the shop.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.900]   He's been working on you in the shop.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.020]   He's been working you up.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.340]   You're his workmanship,
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.340]   created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.900]   That's what he made you for.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:17.300]   He made you to do good, to see a broken and busted world
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.180]   and say, "I'm gonna intercept that.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.520]   "I'm gonna help.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:21.900]   "My Jesus did that for me.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.860]   "Let me now do what my Jesus has done for them."
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.100]   That's what he's saying.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.760]   So God, he's prepared good works for you beforehand
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.420]   that you should walk in them.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.940]   This is the first proof Paul gives of our identity in Christ
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.900]   is that we bear good fruit.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.980]   The second thing is that we grow in knowledge.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.540]   The second proof is growing knowledge.
[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.900]   He says in verse 10,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.940]   "That part about walking in a manner worthy of the Lord
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.080]   "is increasing in our knowledge of God."
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.940]   What does that mean?
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.860]   It means we care enough to learn about him.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:52.700]   That's what it means.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.400]   To grow in knowledge means you care enough
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.520]   to learn about someone or something.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.080]   I love visiting with my brother-in-law.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.280]   He's got three kids and he is an expert at all of them.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.580]   Like he watches them.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.700]   He observes the ways that they play and they talk
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.820]   and the things they tinker with and do.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.060]   He is an expert, a student of his kids.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.060]   Why?
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.140]   Because he loves them.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.780]   He loves them deeply.
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.020]   So he learns about them.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.740]   He has an increasing knowledge of their uniquenesses.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.060]   This is how healthy relationships work, Forge.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.340]   If you wanna know someone well,
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.260]   you grow in your knowledge of them.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.680]   The same thing is true with God.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.100]   If you want to know God, you have to learn about him.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.980]   You have to spend time with him.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.900]   You have to listen to him.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.740]   You have to see the things that he cares about.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.940]   It's not enough to simply have fervor and passion for God.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.780]   Right?
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.260]   Like I've talked a lot from this platform
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.400]   about one end of the spectrum, which is intellectualism.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.060]   The other end of the spectrum is emotionalism.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.100]   We cannot go towards either or.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.980]   We must find ourselves in the center.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.180]   Here's why.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.880]   Because a lot of people have done terribly heinous things
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.860]   in the name of God on the basis of passion and zeal.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.700]   Emotion's not enough.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.180]   I want you to feel deeply about God.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.660]   I want you to be burdened for him.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.980]   I want you to care when you wake up in the morning
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.180]   and care more when you lay down at night.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:22.100]   But you must also have an informed emotion.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.840]   It's both and they go together.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.700]   You see, we cannot grow in God
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.700]   if we will not learn about God.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.700]   We cannot grow in him if we will not learn about him.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.840]   That's what the author of Hebrews says.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.620]   Chapter five, verses 12 through 14, he says,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.580]   "In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers,
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.420]   "people that communicate knowledge,
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.840]   "you need someone to teach you
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.600]   "the elementary truths of God's word all over again.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.820]   "You need milk, not solid food.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.300]   "Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant,
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.800]   "is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.560]   "But solid food is for what?
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.240]   "The mature.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.080]   "By who?
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.460]   "Constant use."
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.580]   Constant use.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.180]   "Not an impulsive passion,
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.020]   "but a daily discipline,
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.820]   "have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil."
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.940]   What's he saying here?
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.300]   It's good for us to grow in our knowledge, why?
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   Because that's how we discern between good and evil.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.100]   That's how we discern between good and evil.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.400]   So second driver's license story of the night.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.440]   I failed my driver's test when I turned 16 years old.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.160]   Anybody else willing to just admit that with me?
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.960]   Feels good, not alone.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.700]   I failed my driver's test when I was 16 years old, why?
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.900]   I didn't read the book.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.940]   I did not choose to read the book.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.180]   Like I assumed that by way of what I saw other people do
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.900]   and what I suspected would be right,
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.100]   I thought that that would be enough.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.020]   I thought, man, I don't need to read this thing.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.740]   I know well enough on my own.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.740]   I've been driving around in cars for 16 years.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.860]   What's a book gonna tell me?
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.700]   I already got this.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.540]   I walked in, I failed the thing.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.940]   So you know what I did next?
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.900]   I read the book.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.120]   I learned well, I took detailed notes.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.320]   I made flashcards, man.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.860]   I knew that thing better than any textbook
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.940]   I studied in high school, why?
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.820]   Because I needed the book to get the thing I wanted.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.140]   I needed the book to get the thing that I wanted.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.520]   I wanted freedom.
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.260]   Life on the open road.
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.880]   Life is a highway, man.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.900]   Like I gotta get out there and go.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.780]   I can't stay boxed in with my mom.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.880]   Like I've gotta get my own wills.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.440]   I wanted what it offered, freedom and life and joy.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:53.820]   If you want freedom and life and joy and peace and depth,
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:58.600]   then you need to read the book.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.020]   It's the greatest thing that's ever been given to me
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:04.860]   is this.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:09.740]   Not because it's full of a bunch of right ideas,
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:15.620]   helpful concepts, moralistic deism to track with,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:20.020]   but because it is the word of my God.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:26.060]   I read it and I don't hear myself, I hear him.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.320]   That's why I love it.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.920]   That's why I return to it.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.880]   If you want all the fullness of life that's available,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.320]   the freedom that's out there in the open,
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.880]   ahead and moving forward with God,
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.840]   the way you get what you want
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.040]   is you cling to what you need, which are his words.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.680]   That's what Psalm 1 says.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:56.160]   Blessed is the man whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.820]   and on his law, he meditates day and night.
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:05.660]   He's like a tree planted by streams of water
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.140]   that yields its fruit in its season
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.020]   and its leaf does not wither
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.940]   and all that that man, that woman does, they prosper.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:19.340]   Does that look like your life?
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.540]   In season, out of season,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.580]   fruit bearing leaves that do not wither.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.140]   Does that look like you?
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.160]   Here's a better question.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.120]   Do you want that to look like you?
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:39.280]   Then delight in his word.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.220]   We grow in knowledge.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.180]   That's the second proof.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.660]   Third proof we see in verse 11,
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.940]   being strengthened with all power
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.100]   according to his glorious might
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.500]   for all endurance and patience.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.940]   Third proof is godly strength.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.660]   We bear fruit, we grow in knowledge
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.700]   and then we have a godly strength about us.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.960]   Not just any kind of strength,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.820]   but a strength that is sourced in his glorious might,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.760]   meaning that we have strength
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.620]   that draws from an inexhaustible supply.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.620]   So your phone, it is decreasing in its life
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.460]   over the course of a day,
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:13.140]   but when you plug it in, it's increasing in life.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.040]   Why?
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.100]   Because it's no longer drawing on its own capacity,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.700]   but on the capacity of something that's greater.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.180]   That's what's true for the believer.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.300]   We're connected to the true vine.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.200]   We're connected to God.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.720]   And because we're connected to him,
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.480]   we have an inexhaustible source of power.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.000]   And yet here's what's interesting.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Like this power is one that is unique in its essence.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.280]   It's not just power to get out there
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.720]   and do whatever you want.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.800]   Seize the day, baby.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.560]   Like that's not what it is.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.720]   Paul, he knows what kind of power this is very specifically.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.400]   He says in 2 Corinthians 12, verses nine through 10,
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.440]   some of my favorite verses.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.800]   But he said to me, God said to me,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.420]   Paul, my grace is sufficient.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.820]   It's enough for you, Paul,
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.380]   for my power is made perfect in your weakness.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.220]   Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:04.440]   of my weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.740]   may rest upon me.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.460]   Like, no, when I'm weak, then I'm strong.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.460]   I will boast in my weakness, in the test,
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.340]   in the trial, in the trauma.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.180]   Why?
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.140]   Because it's in that moment that the power of God
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   from on high, the almighty, the ancient of days,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.680]   it rests on my life.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.880]   That's what I want.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.720]   That's what Paul knows.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.620]   That's the kind of power here.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.660]   For the sake of Christ, then I'm content with my weaknesses,
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.660]   insults and hardships and persecutions and calamities.
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:33.740]   For when I'm weak, then I'm strong.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:34.780]   It's fascinating.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.400]   In this passage, Paul speaks of the power of Christ
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.140]   in the same way that he talks about here in Colossians 1.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.820]   He's saying that there's a power from God
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.780]   that is useful for us when things get tough,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:51.700]   when life is hard, when you feel weak.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.260]   Why do I know that?
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.460]   How is that characteristic of this passage?
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.240]   Because he says that that power is described in two ways,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.560]   through patience and endurance.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.420]   That's what he wants us to get into.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.120]   He wants us to know that whenever your weaknesses arise,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.540]   God's power abounds.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:12.980]   Whenever your weaknesses arise, God's power abounds.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.340]   And we need to know, like, man, as we meet
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.680]   our fair share of adversity and affliction
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.520]   over the course of our life,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.300]   'cause the Christian life is not free of pain.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.660]   In this trouble, in this world, you will have trouble.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.260]   But take heart, I've overcome the world.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.540]   Prosperity gospel, absolute rubbish.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.380]   Don't listen to it, nor believe it.
[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.680]   It's not true.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.780]   God has not promised you in following his son
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.160]   that you will have health, wealth and happiness.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.440]   It's just not the case.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   Because we know Jesus himself, he's spoken against the idea.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.800]   No, there's gonna be a hard life ahead of you,
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.820]   the hard life ahead of all of us.
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.840]   And so what you will need as a believer
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.040]   is you will need patience and you will need endurance.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.240]   Now, there's a lot we can say about endurance and patience,
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.180]   but here's what I wanna do.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.640]   I just wanna spend a little bit of time on one idea
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.780]   about patience and endurance
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.940]   that I think could be useful to you.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.860]   And it's this, it's that these virtues,
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.600]   they are not passive in nature.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.260]   Patience, virtue, they are not passive in nature.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.920]   It's not human instinct and natural resolve
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.480]   to endure some unpleasantness
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.300]   or patiently persist through pain.
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.200]   You don't instinctively move that way.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.080]   When some calamity befalls you,
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   your natural instinct isn't, oh, this is hard,
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.240]   but I will pleasantly endure underneath it.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:34.900]   When someone's rude to you,
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.360]   when they hurt you, tear you down,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.720]   your reaction is not, well, this is very unpleasant,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.400]   but I will gladly listen longer.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.900]   That's not the natural human instinct.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.740]   We don't do that.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.580]   What do we do?
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.020]   We fight back.
[00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:50.940]   How dare you, manly?
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.980]   No, you're not gonna get to do that to me.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   And yet what we know is that while these are not
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.160]   passive virtues for the human experience,
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.600]   these are active virtues of God's essence.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.400]   These are not passive virtues of moral people.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.000]   They're active virtues of God's power.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.160]   They're active.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.300]   They require intentionality.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.820]   I think priest, theologian, Henry Nguyen,
[00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:20.880]   he said it really well
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.080]   when he talked about patience specifically.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.720]   He said, "The word patience means the willingness
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.700]   "to stay where we are and live the situation out to the full
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.060]   "in the belief that something meaningful is hidden there.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.340]   "Impatient people are always expecting the real thing
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.920]   "to happen somewhere else,
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.580]   "and therefore they wanna go elsewhere.
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.720]   "The moment is empty,
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.880]   "but patient people dare to stay where they are."
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.420]   Why would they dare to stay where they are?
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.480]   Because they know God,
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.080]   and as a result of knowing Him,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.560]   they've trusted Him.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:02.120]   So where for you tonight is your patience persisting?
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.980]   Is your endurance eroding?
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.520]   Where is your resolve wavering?
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.820]   Is it your singleness?
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.120]   Your workplace satisfaction?
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.200]   Is it your happiness in life,
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.480]   the amount of money that drops into your bank account
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.720]   every couple weeks?
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.680]   Is it frustrations with family?
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   Is it some addiction you can't seem to conquer,
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.480]   finding friends in a new city, despair, depression?
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:49.240]   Porsche, whatever it is, you need to remember this,
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.040]   the strength to hold on,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.360]   to keep going, to not give up.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.700]   It is not found in you.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.240]   It's found in Him,
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.760]   and He wants freely to give you that strength
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.040]   according to His own power.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.840]   That's His desire for you.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.800]   This is the third proof.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.080]   The fourth proof is gratitude.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.720]   Gratitude, that's what it says in verse 12.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.320]   He says, "With joy, giving thanks to the Father
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.520]   "who has qualified you to share in the inheritance
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.500]   "of the saints in light."
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.000]   What motivates the Christian to be grateful to God?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.640]   That's calling to mind what Christ Jesus has done for us.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.500]   That's what motivates our gratitude.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.600]   It's fascinating.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.720]   Gratitude in our culture, it's a pretty unpopular idea.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.200]   It's pretty counter-cultural, actually.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.480]   People, they'll express thanks cordially.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.960]   You hold the door open,
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.600]   and they'll give you a cursory appreciation for it,
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.680]   but really what our culture, what the world delights in
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.780]   are things like the victim mentality,
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:01.120]   chronic complaining, and entitlement.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.100]   All of these things are not the same as gratitude.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.940]   Which is why Paul commands thanksgiving in this verse.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.260]   Gratitude is more than just a gut reaction.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:18.500]   You see, true gratitude is not just a cursory reaction,
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.860]   but a conscious recognition of God's goodness.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.060]   True gratitude is not a cursory reaction.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.860]   Hey, man, thanks for doing that.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.760]   That was really nice of you.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.940]   No, it's a conscious recognition
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.240]   of God's goodness in your life.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.340]   That's why Paul goes on in verses 13 and 14
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.660]   to give us reason for our gratitude.
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.820]   We should, if we truly believe in Christ,
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:41.900]   experience gratefulness
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.580]   because he has delivered us from the domain of darkness.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.400]   He has transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved son
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.980]   in whom we have redemption and the forgiveness of sins.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.540]   When I was a boy growing up,
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.100]   my parents were militant
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.940]   about making us well-mannered people.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.060]   Militant, man, like my mom would pull up,
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.220]   and I'm outside, and I'm helping her with the groceries,
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.120]   or we're out to dinner, and I'm not on my phone,
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.020]   but I'm engaging in conversation.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.880]   When we would go to my grandparents,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.620]   we would always ask for permission to get up from the table,
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.760]   go around the table, and thank everyone.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.960]   Some of you are nodding your heads
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.360]   because you're like, dude, that is my childhood.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.220]   Here's the thing that was crazy.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.740]   I would go around, and I would thank people
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:26.940]   that did not contribute in any way whatsoever
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.600]   to the dinner that we were eating.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.520]   Why?
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.020]   Because that is cursory in nature.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.440]   I'm just reacting.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.980]   I'm not being conscious, because if I were,
[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:43.300]   I would be thanking the appropriate parties.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.640]   But I'm just going through the motions.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.940]   Here's why I tell you that.
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.660]   I fear that so many of us are just going
[00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.960]   through the motions of gratitude.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:59.080]   I think we're just moving through the motions of gratitude.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.960]   I think we know when the chorus strikes,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.760]   we should lift a hand, or when something good transpires,
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.420]   we should thank the Lord.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:10.760]   But we're not consciously recognizing
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.260]   what God has done in Christ.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:18.600]   Maybe in spurts, maybe like flashes of light
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.860]   in different moments, it'll pop up and we'll be grateful.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:27.000]   But we're not consciously, daily,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.080]   devoting ourselves to recognizing, I was lost.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.400]   I was wretched.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.800]   I was hopeless.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.680]   I was trapped in my sin.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.000]   I lived in darkness.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.100]   God came to save me.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:49.240]   God's heart is that I be near to Him.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.480]   But I didn't want that.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.600]   I threw myself away in my own sin.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.960]   I chose to separate myself as far from Him as possible.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.680]   I said, you don't need to be God in my life.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.200]   I will be my own God.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.320]   And yet God, in His loving kindness,
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.520]   through a grace that abounds the worst of us,
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.720]   said, I'm coming for you anyways.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.240]   I'm gonna move in.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:17.200]   I don't want you to be in the domain of darkness any longer.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.040]   I want you in the kingdom of my beloved son.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.560]   I want you where I am.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.360]   That's the heart of our God.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.240]   And so when we think that way,
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.920]   a conscious recognition of God,
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.640]   we explode into gratitude.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.480]   I can't wait to sing in a moment.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.200]   Like that's all I want is to be near to Him again.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.240]   He's near to me right now,
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.080]   but God, I want to experience you once more.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:48.280]   I want the truths of these lyrics to wash over me again.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.760]   I wanna go back into that chorus.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.720]   And even when we're done singing,
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.600]   I wanna walk out into the talent center
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.280]   and I wanna be grateful to the people around me.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.680]   I want thanks to spill out of my life,
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.960]   not just off my lips.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:08.440]   This is the fourth proof of the Christian life.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.580]   Mindfulness of the gospel leads to thankfulness to God.
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:16.200]   And the reason we know that we can be mindful of the gospel
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.640]   and that will produce a gratitude
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.640]   is because Jesus Christ has done everything we've talked
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.560]   about.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.600]   He's born fruit.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.920]   He came and He lived the life that you can't live.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.560]   He did walk into the good works,
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.680]   which His Father had prepared in advance,
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.280]   but He didn't just bear good fruit in His life.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.260]   He came and He gave us knowledge.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.480]   Like He imparted to you the will of God,
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.720]   which was your salvation.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.800]   But not only that, not just pray the prayer, get saved,
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.440]   no, walk with me forever.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:52.200]   Come be like me, come be near me.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.800]   (gentle music)
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.080]   Jesus lived with the godliest of strengths
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.480]   for His strength was so stalwart
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:08.080]   that He would go to the most humiliating of deaths
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.480]   on our behalf.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.440]   And as He hung there, the weakest moment in human history,
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.900]   as one man bore the consequence of all mankind,
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.320]   He absorbed it without but a word.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.160]   True endurance, true patience.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:33.740]   And then He has given us such a reason for gratitude.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:37.400]   For though He went into the grave,
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.080]   the grave could not keep Him.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:45.440]   For He was not merely a good man, He's King.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.120]   We are the subjects to our Lord.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.320]   We are the servants to our King.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.040]   We are the sheep to the good shepherd.
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.360]   Do you know Him?
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.520]   These proves will not be evidence of your life if not.
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:07.400]   But by merely crying out,
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.720]   all of this and more can begin tonight.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.160]   Let me pray for us.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.280]   Father, we want to live in a manner worthy of You
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.480]   like this word says,
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:21.280]   but God, before we can first live
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.920]   in that manner worthy of You,
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.760]   we must behold You our Christ
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.120]   who died first for those unworthy.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.400]   Amen.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:36.960]   God, I just get this sense tonight
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.660]   that You wanna do something here.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.400]   I don't know what it is, God.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.880]   And I don't know what's stirring amongst the minds
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.320]   of these people here tonight.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.900]   (gentle music)
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.160]   But this I know.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:02.360]   You want more for us
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.240]   than the life, God, we so often settle for.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:12.880]   And tonight, God, all of the freedom,
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.240]   all of the fullness that we've talked about,
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.920]   I believe in but a moment we will experience.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.800]   We are grateful to You, God.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.000]   You are Lord Christ Jesus.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.040]   Move amongst these people.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.560]   Some of you need to surrender tonight.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:35.000]   You need to wave the white flag.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.040]   You need to lay it all down.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.080]   You need not follow yourself any longer.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.360]   You need to follow Him.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:46.080]   He's waiting for you.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.520]   But not just that, He's wanting for you.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.840]   Come to Him.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.520]   For the believer in the room,
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:56.880]   what proof of the Christian life
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.360]   is not in fact evident of you?
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:05.400]   Repent and let us turn, not one by one, but together,
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.760]   for God is awakening us to something more.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.720]   We love you.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.960]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.440]   Poor, let's stand together at this time.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.400]   I'm just gonna prep you for this.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.720]   We have at least two songs that we wanna sing.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.240]   And that's because we want this moment to linger for a bit.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.200]   Please don't rush from here.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.080]   Won't you believe for yourself
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.440]   that God wants something particularly, uniquely,
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.040]   individually for you right now?
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.280]   Don't rush.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.480]   Let us lean in together and listen as He sings over us,
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.880]   and we sing in response.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.840]   We have a team down front.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.200]   They'd love to pray with you
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.960]   if you need to process with somebody.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.360]   But this is your moment.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.600]   Let us experience the goodness of God together.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.180]   (gentle music)
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.520]   (whooshing)
