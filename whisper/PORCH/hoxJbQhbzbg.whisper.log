[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.880]   Well, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.480]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.960]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.080]   If this is your first time ever at the Porch,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.320]   thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.240]   I'm so glad that you joined us.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.880]   I do want to give a special shout out to all the Porch
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.360]   Live locations watching tonight.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.000]   Want to say a special hello to Porch Live Fort Worth,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.960]   and Porch Live Des Moines, Porch Live Boise.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.280]   Thank you for tuning in with us.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280]   So here's the deal.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.560]   I've got three boys, and I've mentioned them here
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.480]   at the Porch before.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.120]   But they are 13, 11, and 5.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.600]   Last September, my oldest son Noah turned 13.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.240]   And this was a big deal, because we had just moved to Dallas
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.600]   not long before that.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.480]   And so his 13th birthday was kind of a big opportunity
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   to invite some new friends over to our house
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.000]   and for Noah to kind of have a win with some new people.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.400]   Well, my wife and I, we totally failed our son,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.960]   because we were like, you know what?
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.640]   Why don't you have some kids over,
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.840]   and we'll get some pizza, and y'all can watch a movie.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.520]   And so our house was full.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.600]   I mean, there was a bunch of kids hitting puberty,
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.680]   all gathered together.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.240]   And we thought it would be enough to just give them
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.400]   pizza and push play on Napoleon Dynamite.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.080]   Like 15 minutes into the movie, these kids
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.280]   start getting bored.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.760]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, it's social suicide.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   We have failed our son.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.640]   All of these kids, they're standing up,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.880]   they're moving around, they're going outside.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.240]   They've had enough of Napoleon Dynamite, which
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.480]   was super offensive to me.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.040]   But anyway, so in the moment, literally, my wife, Kat,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.120]   and I, we are in the kitchen like, what do we do?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.040]   Do you know what to do?
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.480]   What do we do?
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.000]   This is a big moment.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.160]   We have failed our son.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.280]   This is the end.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.480]   Like, he's never going to recover from this.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.400]   And then everything changed, because I had an idea.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.240]   I'm going to start giving out money to these kids.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.280]   So that's what I did.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.720]   I reached into my wallet, and I was like, all right,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.560]   who wants to play some games with a chance
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.960]   to earn some money?
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.440]   And like, every kid was like, yeah, I want some money.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.520]   And so I just pulled out all of the cash
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.200]   that we had in the house.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.320]   I was like, we're going to be playing games for cash
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.480]   for the rest of the evening, and we're
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.840]   going to save this thing.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.080]   Like, that party went to a 10 in no time.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.560]   In the game that I played--
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.600]   I'm going to bring Grace.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.800]   Grace, go ahead and come up here.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.640]   This is a game that you and your roommates
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.040]   can play later on tonight.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.800]   This is a $100 bill that I want to give Grace an opportunity
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.440]   to earn.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.520]   All she needs to do is--
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.920]   put your fingers like that, OK?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.280]   I'm going to drop it.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.520]   And when I drop it, all you have to do is catch it.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.360]   Now, I know Grace, and she's super competitive.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.760]   She was a college athlete.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   So I know how badly you want this, right?
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.200]   So I just need you to--
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.080]   OK.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.480]   That was just-- that was bad.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.400]   OK, bad drop.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.900]   Here we go.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.160]   Are you ready, Grace?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.280]   OK, that's fine.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.080]   All right, now are you warmed up yet?
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.800]   I'm ready.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.880]   OK, she's ready.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.000]   No, you-- OK.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.040]   This is the game.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.920]   All right, are you ready?
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.720]   Catch it.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.840]   It's so frustrating, isn't it, Grace?
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.240]   You want to try one more time?
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.880]   One more time.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.400]   You've got it.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.960]   I promise.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.000]   You've got this.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.960]   Oh, you were so close.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.960]   Thanks, Grace.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.480]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.000]   That game killed with a bunch of 13-year-old boys that night.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.320]   But the reason that I show you that is how many of you
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.600]   were sitting there like, I bet I could do it?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.520]   It's like natural.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.840]   Everyone's like, you know what?
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.720]   I bet I could do it.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.040]   No, if Grace can't do it, I assure you you can't do it.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.320]   Like, she is one of the more competitive people
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.280]   I've ever met.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.920]   She would crush you in most things, all right?
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.460]   And I don't need to know you to know that she would probably
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.560]   win, whatever the game is.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.760]   So here's the reality.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.200]   Money is a very powerful motivator.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.280]   Like, if I were to say, you have a chance to earn $100,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.200]   some of you would be like, that would double
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.800]   how much I have right now.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.640]   Like, that would be incredible.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.800]   But what I saw with these 12-year-old boys,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.940]   13-year-old boys, is when money was introduced into the mix,
[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.880]   it's a very powerful motivator.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.280]   But then what happened was this group
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.160]   of 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, they all lined up
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.800]   like they got in a line.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.320]   And one after another tried to grab the money,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.800]   and one after the other failed.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   But the amazing thing was that everyone in line was like,
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.200]   you know what, I bet I can get it.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.400]   It was like, the guy that went before him, yeah,
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.800]   he's not coordinated enough, but I believe that I will get it.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.480]   And no one could get it.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.040]   And the reality is that when that bill drops,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.600]   and you squeeze your fingers, and you know
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.560]   that you've missed it, that feeling of frustration
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.520]   that it was right there, but you don't have it,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.300]   that is what King Solomon is getting at
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.840]   in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.960]   All throughout the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.620]   which we have been journeying through
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.680]   for the last several weeks, he uses this word,
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.240]   in the Hebrew is the word hevel,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.340]   which in the English is translated as vanity.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.640]   What you need to know about hevel is it's the idea,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.160]   if you're talking about a physical substance,
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.080]   it's the idea of a mist or a vapor.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.800]   But when you're talking about something metaphorical,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.200]   you're talking about something meaningless or empty.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.700]   It is the feeling you feel when the bill drops,
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.040]   and you barely miss it.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.080]   That squeeze of the hand with nothing to show for it,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.000]   it's frustratingly empty.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.800]   So we've been looking at Ecclesiastes,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.240]   and we've been learning from King Solomon,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.680]   and all throughout the book,
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.320]   King Solomon is addressing different things,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.720]   and he's just pointing to various things in life,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.120]   and he's like, yeah, that's hevel.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.640]   That's frustratingly empty.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.840]   And now we get to Ecclesiastes chapter five and six,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.520]   and King Solomon talks about money.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.920]   And the interesting thing is that money
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.840]   is a major motivator.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.420]   It is, like people in this room, I guarantee you,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.160]   every person needs to hear a message about money.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.000]   Why?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.240]   Because money is applicable to all of us.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.120]   Everyone needs money to operate in this life.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.760]   Like money determines whether you will eat or not.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.240]   Money determines where you live and where you don't live.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.480]   Money is the reason that some of you posted
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.800]   that perfect picture from Europe this summer.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.040]   Money is the reason that many of you were bitter
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.080]   at the people posting the perfect pic
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.360]   from Europe this summer.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.800]   It's a powerful motivator.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.560]   And what Solomon is going to get at
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   is when you look to money to not just be important,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.480]   but ultimate, when you make money
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.360]   the source of your fulfillment
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.560]   and the source of your satisfaction,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.880]   it's gonna be like that bill dropping
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.520]   and you squeezing your fist and then opening it
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.960]   to see that there is nothing there.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.200]   Even if you, in a sense, grab hold of the money
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.000]   and you become extremely successful in this world,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.340]   you need to know that in the end,
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.820]   if money is ultimate to you,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.080]   in the end, it will be frustratingly empty.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.540]   So if you have a Bible, I wanna invite you
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.540]   to turn tonight to Ecclesiastes chapter five.
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.340]   Ecclesiastes chapter five.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.040]   Now, as you're turning there,
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.780]   I do think that it's important
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.260]   to just make some caveats about money.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.120]   Like it's important for us to just state from the beginning
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.300]   money is morally neutral.
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.000]   It's a morally neutral thing.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.900]   The Bible doesn't say that money is the root of all evil.
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.020]   The Bible says that the love of money
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.500]   is the root of all evil.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.820]   So money itself is morally neutral.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.020]   It's what you do with money
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.020]   that can actually become something good or bad.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.740]   But money is relevant to every person in this room.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.620]   And money was really important to Jesus.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.500]   Jesus talks about money in 16 of his parables,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.900]   which is about a third of all of his parables.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.200]   He talked about money.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.860]   Jesus talks about money more in the New Testament
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.520]   than he talked about heaven and hell combined.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.660]   The Bible talks about,
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.900]   has about 500 verses on prayer.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.220]   The Bible has less than 500 verses on faith.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.480]   And there are over 2000 verses
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.440]   dealing with money and possessions.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.980]   Money is referenced in one out of each 10 verses
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.140]   in the Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.500]   Money was very important to Jesus.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.860]   Jesus goes so far as to say that
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.800]   wherever your treasure is,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.740]   that's where your heart will be also.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.980]   What does he mean when he says that?
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.940]   All he's basically saying is,
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.100]   hey, there is a collision point
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.640]   between what your affections are stirred for
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.220]   and where your passion is,
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.500]   and where your money is.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.980]   Like your affection, your passion, and your money,
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.620]   they're gonna go in the same direction.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.780]   That's how important money is.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.140]   So the question that you need to answer tonight
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.460]   is will you have your money,
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.540]   or will your money have you?
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.640]   What I'm really getting at is,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.480]   is will you operate like money is a gift,
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.740]   or is it a God?
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.400]   'Cause that will determine
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.620]   whether you're able to enjoy money,
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.380]   or whether money will be a source of great stress
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.620]   and anxiety and fear and a need for control.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.880]   So that's where we're going tonight.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.220]   Remember, we're learning from King Solomon.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.380]   Okay, Solomon is most likely the wisest man
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.220]   to ever walk on the earth besides Jesus,
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.280]   and he was probably the richest man
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.320]   to ever walk on the planet.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.680]   Okay, people estimate that his yearly income
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.820]   was over $1 billion.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.820]   He saw nine zeros when he checked his bank account balance.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.040]   He never had to keep a budget.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.340]   He never had debt.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.200]   He never had to eat at home to save money.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.660]   He never had to say no to himself.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.500]   If he wanted something, he bought it.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.860]   Money was in Solomon's wheelhouse.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.540]   So if he has something to say about it,
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.900]   it'd be worth us listening to him on it.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.260]   And here's what he says in Ecclesiastes 5, verse 10.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.520]   This is his thesis on money.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.500]   Don't miss it.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.580]   Here's what he says.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.100]   He says, "He who loves money
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.440]   "will not be satisfied with money,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.180]   "nor he who loves wealth with his income.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.300]   "This also is vanity."
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.740]   Look at what he's saying when he says,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.820]   "He who loves money."
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.060]   The idea of that word love there,
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.060]   it's the idea of a cultivated appetite.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.380]   So what he's saying is if the appetite
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.000]   of your heart and soul is cultivated for money,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.400]   meaning if money becomes the thing
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.780]   that your soul needs most in order to be fulfilled,
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:47.860]   do you hear what he's saying?
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.980]   He's saying, "He who loves money,
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.280]   "he whose soul craves money,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.420]   "he who longs to be satisfied with money,
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.600]   "he that looks and says, 'The thing that I need most
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.180]   "'in order to be happy in this life is more money,'"
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.760]   he says, "that person will not be satisfied."
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.020]   You are looking to money to do what it cannot do.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.300]   Won't be satisfied.
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.980]   "He who loves wealth with his income,"
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.460]   he says, "this also is vanity, this also is hevel.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.900]   "It will be frustratingly empty."
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.540]   Because even if you get your hands around money,
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.720]   in the end, in your hopes to feel full,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.480]   you are still going to feel empty.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.660]   Money can do a lot of things.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.620]   It can, it can do a lot of things.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.580]   Like it can make you feel temporarily secure.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.260]   Like if you look at your bank account
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.180]   and there's money in it, you might feel secure.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.220]   Okay, some of you ladies right now are like,
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.140]   one of the hundred reasons I don't need a man right now
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.900]   is because I'm making my own money.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.260]   I don't need the whole thing of,
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.780]   I need a guy to provide for me.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.300]   No, you're providing for yourself,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.380]   so you feel really secure in that.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.780]   Some of you guys are like,
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.700]   if those girls could raise their hand real quick,
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.280]   that would be super helpful.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.840]   But money can make you feel temporarily secure.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.260]   Money can make you feel temporarily significant.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.720]   Like if you can afford to pick up the tab at happy hour,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.880]   or you've got all the Voriath leisure,
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.040]   or you're living in that bougie apartment complex,
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.960]   I don't know what it is for you.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.600]   If you've got the Tesla,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.960]   like if you have what others don't
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   and it makes you feel great about you,
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.200]   money can have that effect.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.700]   It can make you feel temporarily significant.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:54.280]   Money can temporarily relieve you from pain.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.360]   Why?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.840]   Because you go out and spend money
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.040]   that you don't even have,
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.580]   but you know what, it's a distraction,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.940]   and it can numb some pain.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.680]   But did you notice the recurring word that I used,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.420]   the word temporarily?
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.500]   It can do a lot of things temporarily,
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.680]   but it cannot do anything lasting.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.700]   You either have to keep accumulating more,
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.740]   or you have to keep spending more
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.920]   in order to be satisfied with money.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.360]   It can't satisfy the deepest longings of your soul.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.200]   Some of you are like, well, let me just at least try.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.720]   And if that's you, you're like that 12 year old boy
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.320]   waiting in line, like, I can get it though.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.560]   It'll be different for me.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.540]   No, it won't.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.220]   How many unhappy rich people
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.240]   do I need to put in front of you?
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.400]   Before you say, it wouldn't be any different for me.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.460]   John D. Rockefeller was considered one of,
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.460]   if not the most wealthy American of all time.
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.060]   And y'all know the story.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.380]   I mean, the story goes that someone asked him,
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.500]   how much money is enough?
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.640]   And what did he reply?
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.080]   Just a little bit more.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.120]   How much money is enough?
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.920]   To a guy who has more money
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.060]   than any of us will probably ever see?
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.980]   Just a little bit more.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.060]   See, the more money you have, the more you want.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.500]   And the more you spend, the more you wanna spend.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.020]   And so that's Solomon's point.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.260]   That's why he says, he who loves money
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:32.540]   will not be satisfied.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.500]   The more you have, the more you want.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.540]   The more you spend, the more you wanna spend.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.860]   What is Solomon's thesis?
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.860]   His thesis is this, money is a terrible God.
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.940]   It's a terrible God.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.920]   When I say our tendency is going to make money a God,
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.400]   all I'm saying is our tendency is going to be
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.040]   to look to money to do what only God can do,
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.760]   which is satisfy the deepest longings of our souls.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.120]   If you're here tonight and you're thinking,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.520]   like one of the questions that have come up recently,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.720]   like Cat and I will ask each other on date night,
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.240]   if you got a million dollars right now,
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.060]   what would be the first thing you'd buy?
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.400]   If you wanna know my answer,
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.700]   it'd be a top of the line,
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.780]   super aeronautique, wakeboard boat.
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.160]   If you wanna buy it for me,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.320]   I won't have to get that million dollars.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.820]   But anyway, different story.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.960]   We ask that question to each other just for fun.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.640]   Because the reality is, is if someone gave us a million
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.780]   dollars, it wouldn't solve our problems.
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.200]   If I got that wakeboard boat,
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.000]   it wouldn't solve my problems.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.700]   It wouldn't satisfy my soul.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.320]   I would get that boat and I'd be like, yeah,
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.280]   but it'd also be really nice to get a new car.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.360]   And you know what?
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.340]   Now that we have the money,
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.960]   I think I kind of feel like we need a bigger house.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.800]   And now that we have a bigger house,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.760]   it feels like we should put in a pool.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.480]   And now that we have a pool, you know what?
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.760]   But we don't have a covered path.
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.820]   And it's just like one thing after the other.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.320]   The more you have, the more you want.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.560]   The more you spend, the more you wanna spend.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.760]   But if I were to say to you,
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.200]   if someone were to give you a million dollars
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.080]   and some of y'all just like, you just feel instant peace.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.520]   It's like, is that an option?
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.240]   It's just instant peace.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.640]   Like it's the answer.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.580]   It's the answer for your soul.
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.040]   And that's the wrong answer.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.600]   Only Jesus can do what you're looking for.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.320]   So that's his thesis.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.380]   Money is a terrible God.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.520]   And then the rest of the passage is just
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.140]   Solomon explaining what makes money a terrible God.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.100]   So look at what the first reason is
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.220]   that money is a terrible God because it has side effects.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.680]   It has side effects.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.120]   You know, those commercials that come on TV and I get it.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.320]   No one watches live TV for the most part.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.360]   But when you do watch live TV,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.000]   you know those medicine commercials where people are like,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.120]   like there's really inspirational music
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.520]   and people are like running with their dog
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.020]   or like having a barbecue with people
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.240]   and like giving their dog a noogie
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.160]   or like they're sitting on a beach in a bathtub
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.840]   next to a significant other.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.520]   And you're like, where'd those bathtubs come from?
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.680]   Like, did you bring those?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.960]   Did you just like find them?
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.820]   It's like, I know what's a good idea.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.600]   Let's get into these random public bathtubs.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.420]   I don't know what I'm talking about right now,
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.620]   but you know, those medicine commercials
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.840]   where at the end there's that soft, soothing voice
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.600]   that comes on to tell you the side effects.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   It's like, talk to your doctor before trying this medicine.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.440]   Taking this medicine can cause nausea, diarrhea, vomiting,
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.920]   demon possession, or even death.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.440]   It's like, wow, I should probably still take it.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:58.720]   Like, I just want to be the soft, soothing voice
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.420]   that just speaks in, it's like, you just need to know.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.440]   Money, not money, but the love of money
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.560]   can have serious side effects.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.120]   Money is a terrible God.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.960]   It has side effects.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.360]   And Solomon says, you want to know
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.540]   what the first side effect is of loving money?
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:24.460]   Is it increases friends.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.840]   Having more money, it gets you more friends.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.200]   Look at what he says in verse 11.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.080]   He says, when goods increase,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.280]   meaning when you have more money,
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.320]   they increase who eat them.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.840]   And what advantage has their owner
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.480]   but to see them with his eyes?
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.320]   You know what he's saying?
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.080]   He's like, look, when you get more money,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   it's going to be interesting.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.560]   You're going to naturally have more friends.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.040]   Why?
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.100]   Because people are going to begin to see you for your money.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.540]   And people are going to want to be around you
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.880]   because they're going to want something from you.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   One source said that by the late 1880s,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.320]   John D. Rockefeller was receiving thousands of letters
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.520]   a week asking for charitable donations.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.160]   One historian said that he was stalked, badgered, harassed,
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.600]   and followed wherever he went.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.680]   He couldn't walk down the aisle at church
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.640]   without people asking for some money.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.920]   Bernie Kosar, who was a quarterback
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.400]   for the Cleveland Browns decades ago,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.320]   he made millions playing in the NFL.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.440]   And then he was in a 30 for 30 episode on ESPN.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.520]   He had to declare bankruptcy.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.240]   But one of the things that came out
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.840]   about this quarterback who had made millions in the NFL
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.040]   is at one point he was paying
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.920]   60 different cell phone plans.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.760]   60!
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.080]   60 different cell phone plans.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:57.920]   Why?
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.320]   The more money you have, the more friends you get.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:06.280]   I mean, think about the old sage, Kanye West.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.900]   And his classic song, "Gold Digger."
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:17.300]   There's a lot of wisdom.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.280]   He talks about having to take his girls,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.460]   four kids, to showbiz pizza.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.800]   And what does he say?
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.560]   He says, "Okay, get your kids.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.240]   "And then they've got their friends.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.820]   "I pulled up in the bins, they all got up in.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.600]   "We all went to den.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.000]   "And then I had to pay."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.420]   What's his point?
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.680]   The more money you have, the more friends you get.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.760]   Somebody like, "Did he really just quote 'Gold Digger'?"
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.020]   Send me the email, that's fine, that's fine.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.900]   I mean, I wouldn't be surprised
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.820]   if some of my wealthier friends get asked weekly
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.500]   to consider investing in a new business venture
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.900]   or to support the work of a non-profit.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.740]   Why?
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.500]   Because people see them for their money.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.300]   The more money you have, the more friends you will have.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.700]   People will see you for your money.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.020]   And here's the deal.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.780]   That's just a part of reality.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.040]   That doesn't mean that you don't go out and make money.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.380]   But here's the issue.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.240]   When money is your God,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:34.180]   and you sniff out that anyone is seeing you for your money,
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.320]   do you know what's gonna happen?
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.900]   You're gonna get bitter, you're gonna get angry,
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.980]   you're gonna withdraw from people,
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.860]   you're gonna see everyone through a skeptical eye,
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.560]   and you might even give less because you don't trust anyone.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.500]   The second side effect, in addition to increasing
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.060]   your friends, is money increases complexity.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.180]   Look at what Solomon says in verse 12.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.300]   He says, "Sweet is the sleep of a laborer,
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.060]   "whether he eats little or much,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.620]   "but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep."
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.480]   Do you hear what he's saying?
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.120]   He's saying money doesn't just buy you what you want
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.200]   and empower you to take the most elaborate
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.100]   and extravagant vacations.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.660]   It also increases complexity and responsibility.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:25.420]   So Solomon contrasts a really rich guy
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.740]   who has a lot of stuff with a day laborer
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.060]   who just has enough to get by, and what's his point?
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.020]   He's like, "The guy who just has enough to get by,
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.900]   "like he wakes up, he goes to work,
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.060]   "he makes enough money to eat,
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.600]   "and then he goes to sleep and wakes up
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.100]   "and does the same thing over again,
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.820]   "that guy sleeps really peacefully at night
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.540]   "because there's nothing to lay awake and think about."
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.740]   But the more money you have,
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.800]   the more complexity that is introduced into your life.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.660]   The bigger the house, the more there is to clean.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.680]   Like it's nice to have that beautiful landscape,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.860]   but somebody's gotta keep it up.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.920]   It's amazing to have the lake house or the ranch house,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.540]   but someone has to manage those properties.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.660]   And you're like, "Well, I'll just pay someone to do that."
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.480]   Yeah, but you gotta find the right people to do it,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.100]   and then you have to make sure that they're actually
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.500]   doing a good job at it.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.260]   Don't hear me saying, "Don't be successful,"
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.460]   or "Don't buy the ranch house," go buy it,
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.060]   and then let the porch team use it for a staff retreat.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.420]   We would love to do that.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.980]   My point is that it just brings more complexity.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.260]   I was talking to a friend, and his parents built
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.500]   this massive house on a peninsula in Lake LBJ
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.560]   outside of Austin, and he was like,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   "This house has eight different air conditioning units
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.640]   "and 100 different sprinkler heads.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.560]   "Can you imagine 100 sprinkler heads?"
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.800]   Like there's a leak in the yard, good luck.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.940]   Just introduces complexity.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:06.180]   So there's more of a temptation to lay awake at night,
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.980]   just thinking about everything that you're having to manage
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.340]   and what isn't working right,
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.100]   and who's gonna take care of that.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:18.860]   And so sometimes you can't enjoy yourself.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.940]   If money is your God, you won't be able to enjoy yourself
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.580]   because you have to control all your stuff,
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.420]   and you won't be able to watch other people
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.700]   enjoy your stuff for fear of them breaking it
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.660]   or ruining it.
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:39.340]   Next, money is a terrible God because it can be lost.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.100]   So if you're tracking, Solomon's thesis
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.820]   is money is a terrible God.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.020]   So he starts out and just says,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.220]   "Look, money is a terrible God
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.340]   "because it has terrible side effects.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.580]   "It increases your friends and it increases complexity."
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.860]   Now he's making the point money is a terrible God
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.580]   because it can be lost.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.520]   There's no guarantee that you will always have it.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.860]   So look at the story he tells in verse 13.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.220]   He says, "There's a grievous evil
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.600]   "that I've seen under the sun.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.700]   "Riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.880]   "and those riches were lost in a bad venture.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.860]   "And he and his father, and he is a father of a son,
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.320]   "but he has nothing in his hand.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.920]   "As he came from his mother's womb, he shall go again,
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.220]   "naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.420]   "that he may carry away in his hand.
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.440]   "This also is a grievous evil
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.220]   "that just as he came, so shall he go.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:41.320]   "And what gain is there to him who toils for the wind?
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.680]   "Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.940]   "and much vexation and sickness and anger."
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.680]   Do you see the picture he's painting?
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.560]   He's like, "Look, here's a guy who had a bunch of money
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.420]   "and then things went really bad.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.480]   "There was a bad venture and he lost everything,
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.860]   "but he's got a kid and he's got nothing now
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.420]   "to take care of his kid with."
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.860]   So he's gonna die in a similar way that he was born.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.320]   He brought nothing into this world,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.420]   he gets to take nothing out of it.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.540]   He was empty-handed on the day of his birth,
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.140]   he's gonna be empty-handed on the day of his death.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.300]   And because he's lost everything,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.080]   because money has been his God,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.980]   he's gonna live his life in darkness
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.920]   and in much vexation and sickness and anger.
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.820]   So this is just a picture of guy who's lost everything.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.740]   This is why money is a terrible God.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.820]   There's no guarantee that you will always have it.
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.860]   But when money is your God, that can wreck you.
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:44.860]   I mean, isn't that the plot line to that TV show, "S Creek"?
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.800]   I'm not gonna say the first name,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   even though it's just a person's last name,
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.660]   but some of y'all will email me about it still.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.100]   But what's the plot of that show?
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.860]   I mean, you've got Alexis, you've got David,
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.480]   you've got Myra, Moira, and Johnny.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.660]   They've lost everything,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.980]   and it's like their lives are over
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.860]   because they've lost all their money.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.060]   And that might be you.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.900]   If money is your God and you lose it all,
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   it can be devastating.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.900]   I was reading this article that was written
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.740]   by a guy who went from riches to rags.
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:24.640]   So when I was growing up, when I was a kid,
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.980]   there was this TV show on, I didn't really watch the show,
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.580]   but it was a famous TV show.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.660]   It was called "Roseanne."
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.220]   I'm not telling you to go watch it.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.620]   Like, I didn't watch it, but it was a very,
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.500]   it was a famous show for probably about 10 seasons.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.260]   And one of the writers for the show
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.620]   wrote an article about his life.
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.380]   And he basically is a modern-day version
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.460]   of what Solomon just talked about.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.620]   He's a guy who lost everything
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.520]   and went from a cushy life to being homeless.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.980]   Here's what he writes in the article.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.140]   He says, "On Christmas Day, 2001,
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.140]   I sat down at my Yamaha G2 Grand Piano.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.940]   It was late afternoon,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.560]   and the warm orange light of the fading day
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.140]   poured into my five-bedroom house,
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.620]   paid for by my $300,000 a year income
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.620]   as a Hollywood comedy writer in San Marino, California,
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.660]   a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.100]   My wife Marina was cooking dinner for me
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.700]   and our eight children,
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.820]   and it was as happy a Christmas afternoon
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.120]   as I would ever have.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.500]   On Christmas morning, 2008,
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.780]   I woke up on the floor of the 1997 Chrysler minivan
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.180]   I lived in, parked behind the Kinko's
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.580]   just two miles from my old house in San Marino.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.440]   It was raining, and I was cold,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.940]   even though I had slept in three layers of clothes."
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:01.340]   This is a guy who graduated from college with honors.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:06.300]   He became a successful writer and made tons of money.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.260]   But the TV show that he was working for
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.120]   is taking a toll on his family.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:15.820]   So he had saved up, he had about $500,000 in savings,
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.220]   and so he stepped away from the show
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.100]   just to devote more time to his family,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.720]   and he took about two years off from work
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.060]   to invest in his family.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.740]   And after those two years,
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.360]   he tried to go back and get a job,
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.780]   and he couldn't land a job.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.360]   And he began looking and searching
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.380]   and applying and applying.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.140]   This guy didn't become an alcoholic,
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.540]   he didn't become a drug addict,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.340]   this was simply a guy who couldn't get a job,
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.620]   and then the market crashed in 2008.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.120]   He lost everything,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.360]   and he ended up homeless.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.700]   And the reality is,
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:54.300]   the reality is, is here is a guy
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:58.960]   who was trying to do what was right,
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.760]   and yet he still lost everything.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.980]   And it's just a good reminder that money can be lost.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.100]   That's why it's a terrible guy,
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.780]   because there's no guarantee
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.220]   that you will always have it.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.220]   But if money becomes your God,
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.460]   and then you lose all of it,
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.900]   you're gonna go through life angry and bitter,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.100]   and you're gonna play the victim.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.940]   You're gonna go through this life wishing
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.900]   that you could go back to the glory days of your past.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.140]   What I appreciated about this guy in the story
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.740]   is his life, like now, the money he makes,
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.700]   it's from contract jobs he finds on Craigslist.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.220]   Like, there hasn't been this major recovery story
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.820]   where his riches have been restored,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.700]   but here's a guy, there was no bitterness in the article.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.780]   He didn't blame anyone.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.860]   He's content in life,
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.660]   and survives off of what he makes off of Craigslist,
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.460]   because he has realized that money
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.920]   isn't the thing that can satisfy.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.140]   And so I just tell you that,
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.420]   and some of y'all are like, you know what?
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.940]   You're in your early to mid-20s,
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.100]   or maybe you're late 20s, early 30s,
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   and you just haven't lived enough life to reach this point.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.700]   But the reason we're talking about it now
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:20.300]   is who you are now, and how you view money now
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.380]   will determine how you respond later.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.540]   And so what I'm trying to do
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.060]   is I'm just trying to help you believe from now
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.860]   that money is a terrible God,
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.820]   because if you believe from now that money is a terrible God,
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.660]   and you never look to money to be your God,
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.900]   then you can have it, or you can lose it,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.060]   and your life will not depend on it.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.180]   And so what would it look like
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.340]   for there to be 2,000 young adults who leave tonight
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.780]   saying, look, money is important,
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.380]   we have to have money to live,
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:58.320]   and yet I won't live for money.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.420]   There's a major difference.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:07.420]   What if we were people who embodied Hebrews 13 five?
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:12.820]   Hebrews 13 five says,
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.180]   "Keep your life free from the love of money,
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.000]   "and be content with what you have,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.080]   "for he," that's God, has said,
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.860]   "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.140]   The good thing about God
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.540]   is that you might lose all your money,
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.860]   but God will never lose you, never.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.020]   (silence)
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.060]   The next reason Solomon gives
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.740]   for money being a terrible God is this,
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:39.740]   money is a terrible God
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.900]   because its intended purpose is to be a gift.
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.260]   That's a really long point,
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:50.140]   but I needed all those words in it to make sense.
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:51.200]   Money is a terrible God
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.100]   because its intended purpose is to be a gift.
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.460]   Money can't do what you want it to do,
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.860]   which is satisfy the deepest longings of your soul.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.700]   Why?
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.700]   Because money has been created
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.900]   simply to be a gift from God,
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.200]   but it was never made to be your God.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.380]   That's why Solomon says in verse 18,
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.960]   he says, "Behold what I've seen to be good."
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.420]   Now watch this,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.640]   because up until this point,
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.420]   he's talked really negatively about money,
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.340]   but now he spins it and talks positively.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.860]   He says, "Behold what I've seen to be good
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.740]   "and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.600]   "in all the toil with which one toils under the sun,
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.580]   "the few days of his life that God has given to him,
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.080]   "for this is his lot.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.440]   "Everyone also to whom God has given wealth
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.260]   "and possessions and power,
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.600]   "to enjoy them, to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.780]   "This is the gift of God."
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.060]   Do you see what Solomon is saying?
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.080]   He's saying, look,
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.140]   hey, first off, Solomon is just saying,
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.820]   look, all of life is a gift from God.
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.660]   Like the fact that you have breath in your lungs,
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.360]   that is a gift from your maker.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.260]   And everything you have in your life
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.400]   has been given to you by God.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.380]   Any money that you make,
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.260]   you might be like, no, it's because I went out
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.260]   and I worked really hard,
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.300]   but how were you able to work hard?
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.380]   It's because God gave you a brain.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.220]   You're like, no, but I'm super creative
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.740]   and I'm a strategic thinker.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.940]   How did you get that way?
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.180]   God gave you that brain.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.660]   You're like, no, I got it from my parents.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.300]   Okay, well, where did they get it from?
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.620]   Just trace it back as far as you wanna go.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.360]   And at some point, it's gonna start with God.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.520]   Everything you have is a gift from God.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.820]   So what is his point?
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.220]   His point is enjoy it.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.480]   Glorify God by enjoying the life that you've been given,
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.880]   the job that you have,
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.740]   enjoy doing it to the glory of God.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.960]   The money that you have, enjoy the money that you have.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:03.080]   Go eat a nice meal sometimes.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.960]   If you have it, go on a nice vacation.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.360]   And at the same time, tap into the joy
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.960]   of blessing other people with your money.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.480]   Experience the joy of giving your money away
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.040]   to God's purposes being fleshed out throughout the earth.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.460]   But enjoy what God has given to you.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.280]   Let it be a gift.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.200]   That's why in verse 20, Solomon says,
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.680]   "For he will not much remember the days of his life,"
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:32.600]   because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.200]   He's like, look, if you get to a place
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.480]   where money is what it is, it's simply a gift,
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.000]   then you know what?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.600]   You can just go from day to day,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.000]   and you don't have to sit there
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.860]   and think really hard about today,
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.720]   because you're just filled with joy.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.160]   You're just moving along,
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.960]   enjoying God and all he has given to you,
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.260]   and you can be satisfied today.
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.280]   And so let me just tell you,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.060]   if you want to experience the joy in your heart
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.380]   that Solomon is talking about,
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.180]   then what does it look like for young adults
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.400]   in Dallas, Texas to do something with this?
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.380]   Well, I would encourage you,
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.740]   thank God for what you do have
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.560]   instead of complaining about what you don't have.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.740]   Okay, stop waiting to get more stuff
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.960]   to finally be satisfied in Jesus,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.360]   because we don't seek Jesus for Jesus's stuff.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.660]   We seek Jesus for Jesus,
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.240]   and Jesus is far more satisfying
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.920]   than anything that this world could offer.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.400]   So thank God for what you do have
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.380]   instead of complaining about what you don't have.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.440]   And then number two,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.760]   view yourself as a steward instead of as an owner.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.400]   View everything that you have as a gift from God,
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.380]   so steward it, don't own it.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.980]   I shared this in the main service on Sunday morning
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.040]   just a few weeks ago,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.940]   so if it's a repeat for some of you, my apologies,
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.040]   but I know a lot of people don't come to Watermark here.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.520]   We'd love for you to come to Watermark
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.800]   if you don't have a church home.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.280]   But one of the best examples I've ever seen
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.240]   of this idea of stewarding what has been given to you
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.120]   is by my friend David.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   And what I shared on that Sunday is several years ago,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.880]   I was working at a church in Austin
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.980]   that did a wakeboard camp during the summer,
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.020]   and so these families would bring their top of the line
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:29.100]   wakeboard boats to this camp.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.020]   And I remember walking down the dock
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.460]   and I saw my friend David
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.060]   standing in the middle of his boat,
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.460]   which was tied up to the dock,
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:41.360]   and he was just standing there looking perplexed at his boat.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.260]   Like he was just confused.
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.520]   I was like, "David, is everything okay?"
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.140]   And here's what you need to know.
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.920]   David had given up his week to drive middle school girls
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.580]   and their counselors around
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.320]   so that these middle school kids
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.500]   could learn how to wakeboard
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.100]   and their counselors could tell them about Jesus.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.460]   And these middle school girls
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.220]   had brought permanent markers onto David's boat,
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.740]   and while they were riding around,
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.020]   they were coloring,
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.540]   and marker had gotten on the seats
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.680]   of this top of the line boat.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.760]   And so I asked David, I was like,
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.220]   "David, is everything okay?"
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.860]   And I will never forget what he said.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.420]   He said this to me 10 years ago.
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.260]   He was like, "Yeah, I was just standing here
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.820]   "wondering why God wanted marker on his boat."
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.440]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.580]   Like he was like, "This boat isn't mine."
[00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.460]   David had sold his company years earlier for $50 million.
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.020]   This was a guy who viewed his house
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.020]   as belonging to Jesus and not him.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.340]   And so they consistently hosted people,
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.960]   opened up their home to people.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.780]   People would come and stay with them
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.900]   because it wasn't theirs anyway.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.220]   If people wanted to use their boat,
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.740]   they gladly loaned it to people.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.140]   Why? Because it wasn't their boat anyway.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.620]   If you were to look at the refrigerator,
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.220]   it was covered from top to bottom
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:10.780]   with support letters from people around the globe
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.460]   who were going overseas to take the gospel
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:14.420]   to those who had never heard.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.580]   Because David had come to a place in his life
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.060]   where he just decided if there was a believer
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.740]   that was seeking to do something for the glory of God,
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.740]   he felt called to give to it.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.360]   And he had just decided this isn't mine,
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.960]   this is his in the first place.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.160]   So own nothing, steward everything.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.860]   And then the final reason that money is a terrible God
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.540]   is because no matter how much you have,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.060]   you will still need Jesus Christ.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.740]   Doesn't matter how much money you have,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.140]   you will still need Jesus.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.700]   Look really quickly at chapter six, the story he tells.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.660]   He just says, "There's an evil that I've seen under the sun.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.340]   "It lies heavy on mankind,
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.480]   "a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honor
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.220]   "so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires."
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.060]   So he's saying, look, picture someone who has everything,
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.660]   all of the money he could ever want,
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.860]   all of the possessions, the house, the Tesla, the boat,
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.460]   the extra homes, the lake house, the box seats
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.300]   to the Mavs games, to the Cowboys.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.800]   He has everything, she has everything.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.160]   Yet God does not give him power to enjoy them.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.300]   But a stranger enjoys them.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.520]   This is a vanity.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.540]   It's a grievous evil.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.460]   If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.060]   so that the days of his years are many,
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:45.060]   but his soul is not satisfied with life's good things,
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.420]   and he also has no burial,
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.580]   I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:56.440]   For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness,
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.780]   and in darkness its name is covered.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.980]   Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:05.780]   Yet the stillborn finds rest rather than the guy
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.920]   who had everything but couldn't enjoy it.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.280]   Even though he should live a thousand years twice over,
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.760]   yet enjoy no good, do not all go to the one place.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.220]   Do you know what he's saying?
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:23.940]   He's like, if you have everything, but you don't have Jesus,
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.260]   in the end you have nothing.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   Because you can't enjoy all you have apart from Jesus.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.100]   You're like, I sure can't.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.220]   No, the problem is is when you make your stuff your God,
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.700]   in the end, you're always going to want more.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.260]   It will never be enough.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:48.020]   Until your stuff can just be your stuff,
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.300]   and Jesus can be your God,
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.740]   that is where satisfaction happens.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.580]   Why?
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.220]   Because you have been made for Jesus.
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.140]   You have been made to worship.
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:02.020]   You have.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:03.380]   You've been made to worship.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:05.940]   You are worshiping something with your life now.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.860]   Your soul is made to worship.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.020]   Your soul was made to worship Jesus.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.540]   But we look other places.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.760]   Jim Carrey, famous actor.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.940]   Many of you have heard this quote,
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.260]   but he said, I think everybody should get rich and famous
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.600]   and do everything they ever dreamed of
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.960]   so that they can see it's not the answer.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.120]   Blaise Pascal said, "There is a God-shaped vacuum
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.340]   "in the heart of each man,
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.020]   "which cannot be satisfied by any created thing,
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.420]   "but only by God the creator,
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:38.160]   "made known through Jesus Christ."
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.800]   See, what you don't want to do is find yourself
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.040]   in a place where you have everything you want
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.960]   and nothing that you need.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.480]   I grew up in the park cities.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.960]   I grew up surrounded by people
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.480]   who had everything that they wanted,
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.300]   but they didn't realize what they were lacking.
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.000]   See, they had everything that they wanted,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.360]   but many of them had nothing that they needed.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.960]   Because you could have all the money in the world,
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.800]   but here's the reality,
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.020]   you cannot buy your way into a relationship with God.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.560]   That's the wrong currency.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:16.020]   Cash is not the currency of heaven.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.040]   The body and blood of Jesus Christ
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.540]   is the currency of heaven.
[00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.840]   Money will not get you into heaven.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.800]   If you get to the end of your life
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.760]   and you're on your deathbed
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.800]   and you're looking back on all that you've made
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.600]   and all that you have, you just need to know
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.360]   that's the end of it.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.640]   It stays here.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.480]   It will not be enough for God.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:41.720]   The scripture says that you have been bought at a price
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   and that price was the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:49.280]   See, money is not enough,
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.880]   but Jesus's death, burial and resurrection
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.520]   is enough to make you right with God.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.160]   That's why I say everyone here was created
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.520]   to be in relationship with Jesus.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.340]   And Jesus Christ is the only way
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:05.640]   to have a right relationship with God.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.800]   This is what eternity with God costs.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.680]   This is what salvation costs.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:17.560]   Salvation costs the body and blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.080]   That's the price.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.720]   I'll end just by pointing you to Judas Iscariot.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.160]   We know Judas is the guy who betrayed Jesus.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.200]   I want you to think about Judas for a moment.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.720]   Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.040]   Why?
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.680]   Because money was his God.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.640]   Judas was in charge of Jesus's bank account.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.880]   Judas used to pilfer from Jesus's bank account.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.060]   Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.520]   And yet, when he got that 30 pieces of silver,
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.280]   it's like he caught the bill.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.680]   It's like the money dropped and he caught it.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.360]   And yet, what did he do?
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.920]   He went out and bought a field and committed suicide.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.440]   Why?
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.240]   Because he realized he had chosen the wrong God.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.880]   Money is a terrible God.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.160]   So the question you need to answer is,
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.540]   will you have your money or will your money have you?
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.040]   You've been made for Jesus.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.880]   If you don't know Jesus, would you come into him tonight?
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.600]   Would you put your trust in him?
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.080]   Would you let Jesus be the satisfaction of your soul?
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.880]   Maybe you're here tonight
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.800]   and you're just sitting there saying,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.760]   "Look, I realize that money doesn't have
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.040]   "a healthy place in my life."
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:41.280]   If you need to come down front and pray with someone,
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.480]   there will be people down front.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.720]   We would love to pray for you.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.760]   If you need to go up to the prayer chapel,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.320]   you can go up and just get alone with God
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.560]   and do business with him.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.400]   If you need a copy of the word of God,
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   we wanna, the Bible, we wanna give it to you.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.160]   You can go out to the welcome desk and ask for a Bible.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.360]   We will gladly give it to you
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.680]   so that you can begin to center your heart
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.880]   on what is true.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.720]   But do business with the Lord tonight.
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.400]   May we be a group of people.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.280]   May this room of 2,000 young adults leave here tonight
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   believing that nothing is better than knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.560]   Let's pray together.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:30.200]   Lord Jesus, you're a good king.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.560]   I thank you that you went to the cross,
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.960]   that you died, you were buried,
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.480]   you rose from the dead, you conquered the grave
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.560]   so that we might have life.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.480]   You did what money could never do.
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:49.840]   You made a way when there was no way
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.800]   for us to be right with God.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.280]   So if there's anyone here tonight
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.320]   who doesn't have a real relationship with you, Jesus,
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.760]   I pray that tonight they would come,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.000]   they would put their faith in you,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.600]   they would surrender their life to you,
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.800]   that they would know you as savior and king.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.880]   We love you, God.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.800]   Would you, Lord Jesus, be the satisfaction of our souls?
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.560]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:27.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
