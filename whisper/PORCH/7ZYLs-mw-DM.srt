1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,520
 - All right, Porsche, how we doing?

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,840
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,680
 Good.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,520
 We are wrapping up our series tonight,

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,720
 There He Said It.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,240
 And before we do that, I wanna welcome

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
 one specific Porche Live location.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,440
 It is a significant night for them.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,080
 And it's actually a historic moment

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,160
 because these guys are about to break off

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,960
 and be their own young adult ministry and serve their city.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,760
 And they were actually the first

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,420
 Porche Live location to ever exist.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,080
 So this is a really big deal.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,800
 And we could not be more excited for these people.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,880
 We believe in their team, in their staff, in their city.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,060
 And we are so excited to welcome and say thank you

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,360
 and send off in an honoring way, a strong way,

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,520
 give it up for the Porche Live Fort Worth

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,600
 for tuning in tonight.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,320
 (audience cheering)

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
 We love you guys.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,000
 We're praying for you guys.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,540
 And we are so excited to see the way

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,920
 that you impact the young adults

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
 all across Fort Worth, Texas.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,680
 And of course, my friends tonight in Dallas, welcome.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,520
 Last week, David, he talked about

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,380
 the shocking statement from Jesus,

31
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,120
 which was ask and you shall receive.

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,340
 It was just this really great reminder

33
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,360
 that God wants his children to come and ask and seek

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,200
 and knock and be persistent

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,000
 because he loves to give good things to his children.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
 And tonight we're taking like a pretty big turn

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
 because that was in Matthew chapter six.

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,800
 Jesus is teaching his first sermon

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
 called the Sermon on the Mount.

40
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,400
 And this text is in Matthew chapter seven

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,040
 where Jesus is wrapping up that sermon.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,340
 And he just kind of really takes a big turn

43
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,080
 that is kind of a downer.

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,420
 And this passage, I mean, shocking is an understatement.

45
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,180
 This passage actually haunted me for majority of my life.

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,460
 I used to read this text alone in my room

47
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,240
 and not know what to think.

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,620
 And it's a really, really important statement

49
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,660
 that we need to take heed to.

50
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,940
 And Jesus, he takes this statement serious

51
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,460
 because he's serious about us.

52
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,020
 He's serious about us being with him.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,280
 And so let's read Matthew chapter seven, verse 21.

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,780
 Jesus says, "Not everyone who says to me,

55
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,540
 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven.

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,980
 But the one who does the will of my father

57
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,780
 who is in heaven,

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,740
 on that day, many will say to me,"

59
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,740
 he's talking about the day where he returns as king

60
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,140
 and comes and takes those who are his into heaven.

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,900
 He says, "On that day, many will say to me,

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,260
 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,500
 and cast out demons in your name

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,000
 and do many mighty works in your name?'

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,680
 Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
 Tonight's shocking statement from Jesus

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,360
 is "Depart from me, I never knew you."

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,640
 But before we talk about that, I wanna pray for us.

70
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
 God, I ask that you would come

71
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,320
 and do what only you can do.

72
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,360
 Holy Spirit, would you come right now

73
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,060
 and perform the miraculous?

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,340
 Would you take our superficial thoughts,

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,500
 our superficial circumstances,

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,160
 our superficial ideologies,

77
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,720
 and would you transform them

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,000
 into a supernatural awakening of the love of Jesus

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,440
 that he has for every single person in this room?

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,960
 I pray that there is someone here tonight

81
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,560
 that when they read this passage,

82
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
 and the first thing that comes to their mind

83
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,960
 is fear and worry and anxiety, questioning,

84
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,640
 "Is that gonna be me?

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,160
 Is Jesus gonna let me into heaven?"

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,680
 I pray right now you would just bring them a sense of peace,

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,480
 an ability to listen and understand your heart.

88
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,900
 I pray that this is not a message that sends condemnation,

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,300
 but shows your divine character for us,

90
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,660
 the people that you radically love,

91
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,120
 that you would do anything for to be with forever.

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,180
 It's your holy name that we pray, amen.

93
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,680
 I remember in college,

94
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,760
 I was hanging out with my friends one night,

95
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
 it was Halloween weekend,

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,600
 and everyone knew at SFA, Lumberjacks, Axe & Jax,

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,920
 we got two, three, what?

98
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,300
 Yeah, three of you.

99
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,440
 In Nacogdoches, Texas,

100
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,500
 you knew that there was one place you wanted to be

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,760
 on Halloween weekend,

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,320
 and it was the ATO party.

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,560
 Everyone else knew that but me,

104
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,040
 'cause I wasn't really a fraternity guy,

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,520
 I know that you can probably tell,

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,640
 but my roommate was,

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,000
 he was like the poster of fraternity guys,

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,960
 he was actually the president of ATO.

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,800
 And so he was over this whole party,

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,080
 and he goes and is like spending all day planning for it,

111
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,640
 they have this house kind of off campus with this backyard,

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,600
 with this like private fence set up,

113
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
 and it just floods with college students,

114
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,320
 and it's just the place to be.

115
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,200
 Anyone who's anyone's gonna be there,

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,240
 you gotta be there except for me and my friends.

117
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
 And so we're at home, and we're chilling,

118
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,680
 and I'm like, yeah, who needs fraternities?

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,120
 And my friend's like, I kind of would go,

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,920
 I wish I was there.

121
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,720
 And I was like, oh, yeah, I mean, it kind of sounds cool,

122
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,600
 it's better than Nintendo 64,

123
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
 you know, like, I mean, we could go and like hang out,

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
 and he's like, yeah, but we don't have any tickets,

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,420
 like if only we had tickets.

126
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,600
 And in that moment, I was like, I know the president,

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
 like he's my homie, he's my roommate,

128
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,840
 I know Connor.

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,440
 And so I'm like, I got us, let's go.

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,460
 And so we kind of get Halloween costumed up,

131
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,480
 and we head over to the ATO house.

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,000
 I mean, the cars are just parked miles down the road.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,040
 We're walking, you can hear the bump of the music

134
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,820
 in the distance, we're getting excited.

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,760
 My guys are getting anticipated, this is awesome,

136
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
 this is such an amazing, we're about to be

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
 such an amazing night, we're getting so excited.

138
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,360
 And we're pulling up, and right when we're walking up,

139
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,560
 there's two guys, they were definitely pledges.

140
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,560
 They cover the entrance, and they're like, ticket.

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,800
 And I'm like, ticket, what do you think I am, a peasant?

142
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,520
 And I'm like, actually, I got the VIP,

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,880
 I know the president, I know Connor Negley.

144
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,200
 And he's like, man, do you know how many people

145
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,680
 know Connor Negley, we need your ticket.

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
 And I'm looking at my guys, and I'm like,

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,080
 don't worry, guys.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,440
 And I get out my phone, and I'm like,

149
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
 Connor, meet me at the front, I need you to come up here.

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,980
 And they're like, if you can get Connor to come up here,

151
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,360
 we'll let you in.

152
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,260
 And so I'm calling Connor, and my guys are like,

153
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,960
 yo, are you getting us in or not?

154
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,840
 And I'm starting to sweat, I'm starting to feel like,

155
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,760
 you know, such a buzz kill.

156
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,120
 Connor won't answer his phone,

157
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,400
 you can hear everyone screaming,

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
 like something just crazy happened,

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,480
 like someone jumped off a roof,

160
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,240
 and I'm like, I gotta get in there.

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,320
 And I start there because I think a lot of us,

162
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,200
 in the same way, we are living life,

163
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 and we think we know the president, or Jesus,

164
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,540
 and we're gonna be very disappointed and surprised

165
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,100
 if we were to get to heaven one day,

166
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,640
 and he looks and says, you're not in the list.

167
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,320
 I don't know you, I'm sorry.

168
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,380
 And I think a lot of us, when we think about that,

169
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,180
 we're like, wait, I don't necessarily like

170
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,360
 to talk about that, it's not a fun thing to talk about,

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,940
 because we love to talk about Jesus as the loving guy,

172
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,420
 we like to see the painting of Jesus

173
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,380
 with the lamb that he's petting, or with the children.

174
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,880
 We see Jesus as kind of like this softy,

175
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,820
 he's gentle, and grace-filled,

176
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,940
 and I mean, if he was truly loving and good,

177
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,140
 wouldn't he want everyone to come to heaven?

178
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,840
 And the answer is absolutely yes.

179
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,160
 Jesus is all of those things.

180
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,120
 And a lot of people like to talk about the loving Jesus,

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,260
 but the reality is, is he's not just the loving Jesus,

182
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,880
 but also the judging Jesus.

183
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,540
 And I wanna be careful when I say that,

184
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,540
 because the Bible refers to Jesus a lot of times as a judge.

185
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,260
 And when I say that, I do not mean

186
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,820
 that he is looking for people,

187
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,400
 inflicting bad things on them,

188
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,620
 being a mean, angry God, judging people,

189
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,180
 I mean that he acts as a judge.

190
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,100
 The Bible says that people are gonna stand before him,

191
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,020
 and whether they believed in him or not

192
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,020
 will determine whether they get to spend eternity with him.

193
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,820
 And in that moment, he's acting as a judge.

194
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,300
 But we think, and a lot of us think,

195
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,780
 oh, I know Jesus, I can get in,

196
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,620
 and to our surprise, when we get there,

197
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,880
 he says, "Depart from me, I never knew you."

198
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,220
 And just because the reality of what Jesus is saying here

199
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,800
 is that he's not going to let everyone in

200
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,980
 does not mean that his heart and his desire

201
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,300
 is not to want to be with everyone in heaven.

202
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,800
 Jesus wants everyone to be with him forever,

203
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,140
 but the reality is, is not everyone will be

204
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,180
 because they didn't believe him

205
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,180
 and take him at his word in their time on earth.

206
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,180
 I believe this message is the most shocking statement

207
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,720
 in all the statements that we've covered,

208
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,380
 because this isn't just talking about

209
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,140
 getting into some ATO party,

210
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,580
 this is talking about your eternity,

211
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,660
 where you're gonna spend life forever

212
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,680
 with your creator or separated from him.

213
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,020
 And Jesus cares a lot that you know him

214
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,540
 and that you are with him.

215
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,940
 And so what I wanna do with this message

216
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,860
 is not bring a lot of attention to like,

217
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,160
 oh, will I get to heaven?

218
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,840
 Because will I get to heaven

219
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,960
 is making you the focal point, and that's the problem.

220
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,620
 But tonight, what we're gonna answer is,

221
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,440
 do you know Jesus?

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,980
 Do you actually know Jesus?

223
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,780
 Because when you answer and come to the realization of,

224
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,140
 do you actually know Jesus?

225
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,540
 The point of that equation is Jesus.

226
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,600
 And if you don't figure out now on earth

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,760
 that the point of everything is about Jesus

228
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,720
 and not yourself,

229
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,500
 you're gonna get to heaven and be disappointed

230
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,860
 when he doesn't let you in.

231
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,800
 The time to know Jesus is now, not then,

232
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,280
 because if you wait till then, it'll be too late.

233
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,400
 That's what we're gonna see tonight.

234
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,840
 And so as you take notes, for my note takers,

235
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,800
 this is how we can know and be assured

236
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,260
 that we know Jesus and he knows us.

237
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,300
 So let's look at the first verse.

238
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,480
 Let's talk about what it looks like to really know Jesus.

239
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,380
 Verse 21.

240
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,020
 Jesus says, "Not everyone who says to me,

241
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,240
 "Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven."

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,900
 This shows me that saying you're a Christian

243
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,440
 does not make you a Christian.

244
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,180
 Okay?

245
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,820
 Many people will say to me, "Lord, Lord."

246
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,380
 And in that moment, they're saying,

247
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,680
 "Hey, you're Lord, you're Lord."

248
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,940
 But Jesus' response is like,

249
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,400
 "No, no, I don't know you.

250
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
 "That's not true of you."

251
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,300
 Because you can declare with your mouth all day

252
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,300
 that Jesus is Lord, but do your actions exemplify that?

253
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,620
 Has that been your reality?

254
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,140
 Have you made him Lord of your life

255
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,240
 or just Lord of your mouth?

256
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,040
 Like if he just said he's Lord,

257
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
 because saying that he's Lord,

258
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,540
 saying you're a Christian does not make him

259
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,700
 Lord of your life, does not make you a Christian.

260
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,780
 And we're gonna see that.

261
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,780
 Just like saying, "Hey, I'm a good singer,"

262
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,820
 does not make me a good singer.

263
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,660
 Like one of the biggest things that baffle me

264
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
 is American Idol contest,

265
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,580
 like videos on YouTube and Facebook.

266
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,380
 I'm watching and they do the same thing every time.

267
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,340
 They like reel you in the first 15 seconds.

268
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,180
 You're like, "Okay, I'm hooked.

269
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,620
 "I'm watching all eight minutes now."

270
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,460
 And you're watching and they do this like testimonial video

271
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,620
 and you're getting invested in their story.

272
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,420
 And you're like, "I really hope like Megan makes it

273
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,260
 "to the end."

274
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,420
 And she's had a really hard upbringing

275
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,300
 and like got to get out of this small town

276
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,820
 and pursue her dream of Hollywood.

277
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,140
 And I'm rooting for Megan.

278
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,860
 And like, you're like,

279
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,020
 "This is about to be the best voice I've ever heard.

280
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,060
 "This is the next Carrie Underwood."

281
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,080
 And she walks out and the judges are like,

282
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,780
 "Megan, are you ready to change your life?"

283
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,500
 And she's like, "I am."

284
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,980
 And you're like, "Yes, Megan, Megan."

285
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,660
 And she walks up there and the song starts.

286
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,200
 And she's like,

287
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,060
 ♪ I can almost see it ♪

288
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,140
 ♪ These dreams I'm dreaming ♪

289
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,740
 And the judges, it's like immediately sweat forms.

290
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
 Like, you're sweating.

291
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,420
 The judges are like watching and she's going

292
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,460
 and she's like, you know, getting like,

293
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,540
 it's the climb, the high note, but she's not hitting it.

294
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,180
 And you're just wanting it to end now.

295
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,140
 And it gets to the end and she's standing there

296
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,360
 and, you know, Simon and the other ones are just like,

297
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,100
 is that not his name?

298
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,980
 That's his name, right?

299
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,820
 Oh, the other ones, that's funny.

300
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,860
 Okay, got it, got it.

301
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,820
 I don't even know the other ones' names.

302
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,320
 But he looks at him and he's like,

303
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,200
 "Hey, I don't know how you got here.

304
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,640
 "I don't know who told you that you should be here,

305
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,240
 "but I'm gonna be a good friend to you

306
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,380
 "and a truth teller to you and tell you

307
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,620
 "that you are not in fact a good singer.

308
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,060
 "And you should end your desire to be a singer today."

309
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,940
 Some of you need to hear that right now.

310
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,380
 That's the truth you need to hear and you can leave.

311
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,880
 Like, you ain't a singer, all right?

312
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,260
 I'll be the friend and no one else will be.

313
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,780
 You need to go pursue a real, anyways.

314
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,620
 But,

315
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,400
 and what's even more crazy,

316
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,060
 these people are trained professionals

317
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,840
 to decide who's good and who's not.

318
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,760
 And the audacity of Megan to look at Simon, the king,

319
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,740
 and be like, "I don't care what you say, Simon.

320
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,260
 "Like, I am a singer."

321
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,140
 And they take the private interview after

322
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,500
 and she's like, "I'm going back and I'm still going.

323
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,620
 "Like, you know, forget Simon."

324
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,960
 But the reality is, is the judge had the final say.

325
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,980
 Like, Megan didn't get to go on

326
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,280
 because the judge told her, "Hey, you're not a singer."

327
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,900
 And I think a lot of us,

328
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,800
 we think because we say, "I'm a Christian.

329
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,440
 "I'm a Christian, yeah, I know Jesus.

330
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,660
 "Yeah, I'm a Christian."

331
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,080
 But when your life sings, it sounds nothing but atrocious.

332
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,300
 And my fear is, is you're gonna get to heaven

333
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,900
 and you're gonna receive for the first time

334
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,500
 someone telling you, "Hey, you're not a Christian,"

335
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,300
 is the judge, that is Jesus.

336
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,460
 And it's gonna be too late.

337
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:26,560
 Saying you're a Christian doesn't make you a Christian.

338
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,060
 Saying you're a Christian does not mean you live

339
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,140
 in a way that glorifies Christ.

340
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,140
 It's about a matter of the heart, not your words,

341
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,100
 not just professing, but what is actually real.

342
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,160
 And Jesus is saying, "Hey, not everyone who says to me,

343
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,260
 "Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven.

344
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,680
 "You can say one thing, but what's real?

345
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,340
 "Am I actually Lord of your life?"

346
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,420
 In the same way, it's the same with friendships.

347
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,640
 I think the reason why so many of us live this way

348
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,300
 with Jesus and have this kind of relationship with Him,

349
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,600
 where we just say we're a Christian,

350
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,500
 but yet we don't actually live Christ-like,

351
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,020
 is because we do this with people all around us every day.

352
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,220
 Like there's something that we are like programmed to do

353
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,260
 that I've noticed, especially in like our young adult years,

354
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
 is we want to be known by everyone.

355
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
 And we want everyone to think that we know everyone.

356
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,640
 Like it brings some sort of significance to our life,

357
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,200
 especially people that are important

358
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,300
 and can bring more significance to us.

359
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,200
 So we'll do anything.

360
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,700
 We'll stretch anything to make ourself feel inside

361
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,580
 of our mind like we know them.

362
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,660
 I have a few examples here that, you know,

363
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,380
 just because you say, yeah, that's my friend,

364
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,680
 doesn't mean it's your friend.

365
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,220
 The first example is we have the Dap 'Em Up friend.

366
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,540
 You know that person that like,

367
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,980
 you don't ever actually have a conversation.

368
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
 They like show up at the crib or the party

369
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,500
 and they're just like, what up, man?

370
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,700
 And then like they bounce and you like, don't ever,

371
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,220
 like where did he go?

372
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,740
 Like, that's all they are.

373
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,900
 And you've done it like five times,

374
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,200
 maybe throughout college or since you've lived in Dallas.

375
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,980
 And then when someone says, hey, do you know so-and-so?

376
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,440
 Do you know, I don't know, Mark?

377
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,260
 You're like, yeah, I know Mark.

378
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,140
 That's my homie.

379
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,380
 That's my guy.

380
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,580
 Reality is, is like you've dapped and dipped

381
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,100
 like every single time.

382
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,740
 You don't know Mark.

383
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,340
 You know nothing about Mark.

384
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,780
 So many of us have dapped and dipped with Jesus.

385
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,680
 Like there was a time at youth camp

386
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,020
 or there was that worship service,

387
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,480
 or there was that time that your friend told you

388
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,180
 about Jesus or your parents told you about Jesus

389
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,300
 for the first time.

390
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,520
 And you're like, okay, what's up?

391
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,360
 I like this.

392
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
 A life of blessings, a life of peace, you say.

393
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,300
 Heaven, you say?

394
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,660
 Okay, what's up Jesus?

395
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,440
 But then you dipped.

396
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
 Nothing changed.

397
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,100
 And people today are you like, hey, do you know Jesus?

398
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,060
 You're like, yeah, I know Jesus.

399
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,380
 But you've just met him once.

400
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,540
 You don't know him.

401
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,380
 Another example is what I call

402
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,460
 the follow for follow friendship.

403
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,420
 I know what I'm talking about.

404
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,620
 Instagram, you know, we're like,

405
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,460
 you're like, hey, follow me.

406
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,100
 I'll follow, you know, follow back.

407
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,420
 Hashtag follow for follow.

408
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,300
 We are weird, okay?

409
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,160
 (congregation laughing)

410
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,240
 I'm not even gonna ask you to raise your hand

411
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,520
 'cause I know most of you have this reality.

412
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,380
 So many of us, we have so many friends

413
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,140
 that we have never actually met,

414
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,200
 but we know everything about their life.

415
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,600
 Like let's say my friend Teresa over here is like,

416
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,480
 yeah, I have my friend over in Kansas.

417
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,200
 His name is Anthony and he's so awesome.

418
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,280
 Y'all would be great friends.

419
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,120
 And then she goes to Kansas and visits Anthony

420
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,000
 and posts Anthony.

421
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,320
 And then I'm like, okay, cool, Anthony.

422
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,160
 She's like, we'd be friends.

423
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
 I follow Anthony.

424
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,360
 Anthony follows me.

425
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,080
 And I'm like watching Anthony's life.

426
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
 He's watching mine.

427
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,400
 We reply to each other's stories every now and then.

428
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
 And then like the first time you meet Anthony,

429
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,480
 you're like, this is kind of awkward.

430
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,400
 'Cause like, y'all know what I'm talking about.

431
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
 You're like, I know you.

432
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,840
 Like, but the reality is you don't know him.

433
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,160
 Like, I don't know Anthony.

434
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,400
 And I think so many people have done this

435
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,840
 like follow for follow friendship with Jesus

436
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
 where you're like, hey, I'll follow you, Jesus.

437
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,520
 If you follow my agenda, my plans, my wants,

438
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,880
 my desires every now and then,

439
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,080
 like your relationship with Jesus has been through a screen

440
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,840
 or it's just been something really quick.

441
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,240
 And reality is you might know things about him

442
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,400
 or stories about him, but you don't know him.

443
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
 You have no substance with him.

444
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,940
 Another example is what I call the mutual friend friendship.

445
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,680
 Like we all have that friend that you go

446
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,080
 and you, people say, hey, do you know,

447
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,880
 I'm having to come up with these names, Josiah.

448
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,560
 I'm just naming my friends down here.

449
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,360
 You know Josiah?

450
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
 And let's say that I don't know Josiah,

451
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,680
 but my friend Christian knows Josiah.

452
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,240
 And I'm like, but I want to come off like Josiah's cool

453
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,080
 and he has a great jawline and he's buff and teaches good.

454
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,160
 And I'm like, I want to know Josiah.

455
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,080
 I want to act like I know Josiah.

456
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,040
 So I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Josiah.

457
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,920
 Reality is, I don't know Josiah.

458
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,000
 Christian knows Josiah.

459
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,280
 He's a mutual friend.

460
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,040
 Good, great guy to know.

461
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,900
 But that's just a mutual friend.

462
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,080
 I know nothing about Josiah.

463
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,440
 I'm banking off Christian's relationship with Josiah

464
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,540
 to determine mine.

465
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,060
 And so many of us have a mutual friendship connection

466
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,840
 with Jesus only.

467
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,920
 You're writing off the mutual connection with your parents.

468
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,360
 You've been writing on your parents' faith

469
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,480
 for far too long.

470
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,180
 You've been writing on your friend's faith.

471
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,800
 Like when something goes bad in your life,

472
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,340
 you hit up that really spiritual friend

473
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,680
 who seems to like have it together and you hit them up

474
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,520
 and you're like, hey, yo,

475
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,660
 you think you could like pray for me?

476
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,120
 Like you're closer to God than I am.

477
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,080
 And you've been writing off these other relationships,

478
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
 these mutual connections to Jesus

479
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,940
 without having your own connection to him.

480
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,260
 And the last one I have is what I call

481
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,580
 the glow up friendship.

482
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,920
 We know these people that at one point in life,

483
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,880
 they were just normal people.

484
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,920
 Maybe you went to high school together

485
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,800
 or you went to college together

486
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
 and you didn't really treat them like anything special

487
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,400
 because they were just like, they were just normal.

488
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,200
 And then one day you're creeping on Facebook

489
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,600
 and it's been forever since you've seen them

490
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,120
 and whoa, in some way they've made it.

491
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,960
 They became an influencer, they lost a bunch of weight,

492
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,800
 they're doing like a fitness program thing

493
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 or they're like super successful in business.

494
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,040
 They started a company,

495
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,880
 they become famous on TikTok or something like that.

496
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,000
 And you find yourself like, what's up man?

497
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,160
 Or hey girl, like, how's it going?

498
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,800
 And it's the glow up friendship

499
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 because now that they are something

500
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,480
 and they're somebody, you wanna come around

501
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,940
 so you can feel important.

502
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,960
 I think so many of us, when we get before Jesus,

503
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
 standing at the gates of heaven and we see him,

504
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,040
 he's in a glow up in our minds

505
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,820
 and we're gonna be like, oh no.

506
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,240
 On earth, like you were kind of just like insignificant

507
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,800
 to me, kind of just normal, everyone just talked about you

508
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,540
 but you weren't like important enough to me.

509
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,160
 And suddenly you're like, hey Jesus,

510
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,600
 like remember me, I went to the porch.

511
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
 Like, gonna let me in, like, can I come backstage?

512
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,360
 And you have this glow up friendship with Jesus.

513
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,400
 And if I ask you and you're in any of these categories,

514
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,040
 hey, do you know Jesus?

515
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,800
 And you were to say yes, based off of one of these,

516
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,880
 you don't know him.

517
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,900
 That's not a friendship.

518
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,080
 That's not a relationship.

519
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,320
 A relationship takes time.

520
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,920
 It takes proximity.

521
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,640
 It takes repetition and hard work.

522
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,400
 It takes learning and being eager to learn.

523
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
 It takes love and devotion.

524
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,440
 That's how you get to know someone.

525
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,820
 That's a real relationship.

526
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,000
 The reality is, is none of these things that I've mentioned

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,840
 are real relationships.

528
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,840
 And I want you to ask yourself, do I really know Jesus?

529
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,760
 Like, do I just say Lord, Lord,

530
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,920
 or do I come here and just sing songs about Jesus?

531
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,140
 Or do I say all the right things?

532
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,960
 But the reality is, is he is Lord with my words,

533
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,160
 but not Lord in my life.

534
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,720
 There's no real relationship.

535
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,920
 Because simply knowing his name, Jesus is saying here,

536
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,820
 that's not it.

537
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,040
 James puts it this way in James 2, 19.

538
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,720
 He says, "You say you have faith,

539
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,240
 "for you believe that there is one God.

540
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,640
 "Good for you."

541
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,040
 It's like a whoop-de-doo moment.

542
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,040
 Even the demons believe this and they tremble in terror.

543
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,700
 The demons live in the supernatural realm.

544
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,100
 They live in the spiritual realm.

545
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,780
 And so they have no choice but to believe

546
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,300
 in Jesus's existence.

547
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,660
 They see him, they've seen what he's done.

548
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,020
 They saw him die on the cross.

549
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,060
 They know that he exists.

550
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,640
 And I think a lot of us tonight,

551
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,620
 we believe that God is a good thing.

552
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,900
 We believe that God is real.

553
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,840
 We believe that Jesus exists,

554
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,560
 but we have the same problem as the demons.

555
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,320
 And hold up, I'm not calling y'all demons.

556
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,180
 But we share the same problem here,

557
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,720
 because while they know he exists,

558
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 their actions tell me that they don't see him as Lord.

559
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,940
 They see him as real, but they don't see him as Lord.

560
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,640
 And I think so many of us, we come here

561
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,060
 because we believe that Jesus is a good thing,

562
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,320
 or heaven is a fun place that we wanna end up with.

563
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,280
 It's better than hell.

564
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,880
 And we see Jesus as a friend or like a guy that we can go to,

565
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,200
 but we don't see him as Lord.

566
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,460
 It's done nothing to produce change in our life.

567
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,040
 But when you know Jesus, you're gonna see him,

568
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,200
 everything changes.

569
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,920
 And the sad part is, is James says that

570
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,400
 even the demons believe this,

571
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,780
 and they tremble in terror.

572
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:20,780
 The demons see Jesus and tremble in terror.

573
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:27,180
 That means that they have some kind of recognition

574
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,100
 of what he's capable of, of who he actually is.

575
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,220
 And my fear is, is that even demons

576
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,480
 have a more appropriate response to Jesus

577
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,580
 than the very people who claim to be his own children.

578
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,220
 Like even demons, I'll say it one more time,

579
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,580
 even demons have a more appropriate response

580
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,940
 in fearing and trembling at the name of Jesus

581
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,440
 than even those who claim to be his own children.

582
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,580
 Because it gets really easy in this watered down version

583
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,520
 of Christianity in America today

584
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,100
 to come into places like this and to forget

585
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,660
 the power of the name of Jesus.

586
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,380
 We come here and sometimes, I mean,

587
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,080
 I just wanna throw a righteous fit

588
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,460
 because we are singing songs about the testimony of Jesus

589
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,060
 pulling us out of darkness and into light.

590
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,540
 And I look around and I see,

591
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,860
 this is my testimony from death to life.

592
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,640
 I'm like, well, someone sing like they believe it.

593
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,900
 The demons believe and they tremble.

594
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,580
 They have a response when they see Jesus as real.

595
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,860
 When you see Jesus, there is always a response to follow

596
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,020
 when you truly see Jesus.

597
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,980
 But I think a lot of us haven't truly experienced Jesus.

598
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,440
 Sure, we say I'm a Christian or yeah, I know about Jesus,

599
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,220
 but you don't know him.

600
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,260
 And Jesus is saying, many, that sobering many

601
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,060
 will stand before me and say, Lord, Lord,

602
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,460
 that will not inherit the kingdom of God.

603
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,500
 I don't want that to be us.

604
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,700
 I don't want him just to be Lord from our mouth.

605
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,400
 I want him to be Lord of our life.

606
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,660
 So what does it look like to really know him?

607
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,500
 If it's not just to profess and just say, yeah,

608
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,020
 I'm a Christian, what does it look like

609
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,500
 to have a real relationship with him?

610
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,580
 Jesus continues the verse and he says this,

611
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,300
 not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord,

612
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,260
 will enter the kingdom of heaven,

613
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,820
 but the one who does the will of my father,

614
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,100
 who is in heaven.

615
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,780
 So what is the will of his father?

616
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,900
 His father being God, what is the will of God?

617
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,700
 Before I tell us what the will of God is,

618
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,420
 I want to make sure that we understand what it is not.

619
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,420
 Jesus lists out what it is not.

620
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,100
 The will of God is not a relationship,

621
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,100
 or the will of God is not a resume of religious actions.

622
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,940
 Let me say it one more time.

623
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,100
 The will of God or a real relationship with Jesus

624
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,900
 is not a resume of religious actions.

625
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,380
 Because when we hear, hey, do the will of my father,

626
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,060
 that word do, it can be a red flag to some of us.

627
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,420
 And I get it because we say all the time here,

628
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,220
 it's not about what you do, it's all about what he's done.

629
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,780
 It's not about what you do, nothing that you can do.

630
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,420
 Ephesians 2, eight through nine says,

631
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,940
 not by your own works that no man may boast,

632
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,580
 but by grace through faith.

633
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,540
 Titus 3, five says, he saved us,

634
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,060
 not because of works done by us in righteousness,

635
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,540
 but according to his own mercy.

636
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,800
 There is nothing that you can do.

637
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,860
 Jesus is not saying to do something.

638
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,180
 He even expounds on that with the next verse.

639
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,740
 Here's what he says.

640
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,420
 On that day, many will say to me,

641
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,580
 Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name

642
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,580
 or do in your name?

643
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,980
 Did we not cast out demons in your name?

644
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,780
 Do we not do many mighty works in your name?

645
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,820
 And then Jesus says, I never knew you'd depart from me.

646
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,040
 And I read this and this is why this verse haunted me

647
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,060
 for all my life.

648
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,580
 On my best weeks, I mean,

649
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,620
 I'm just trying to read my Bible every day, y'all.

650
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,500
 Like I'm being honest.

651
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,300
 I'm trying to like pray every day, read my Bible every day.

652
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,580
 And on my best days, I ain't casting out demons.

653
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,940
 I ain't never, I'm not casting out a demon yet.

654
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,240
 I say yet.

655
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,340
 I'm not hearing the heavens open up and God speaking to me

656
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,540
 and saying, go and prophesy to the people of the porch.

657
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,980
 I haven't done that.

658
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,820
 I haven't.

659
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:49,300
 And these people are standing before Jesus and are like,

660
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,080
 we have casted out demons.

661
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,760
 We've prophesied in your name.

662
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,660
 We've done many signs and wonders in your name.

663
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,780
 And he's like, nope, not enough.

664
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,420
 Depart from me, never knew you.

665
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,780
 Ain't nobody safe in these streets.

666
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,780
 Like I'm out here, like I haven't even touched that resume.

667
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,820
 But that's the point that Jesus is making.

668
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,300
 It's not about a religious resume.

669
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,720
 It's not about religious activity.

670
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,460
 He doesn't want your activity.

671
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,740
 Again, he wants proximity.

672
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,860
 He wants you.

673
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,940
 Now what you can do, he's telling these guys,

674
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,680
 hey, the best of the best of the religious leaders,

675
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,280
 that's the today, like the Bible study leaders,

676
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,680
 the theologians, the people who pray all the time,

677
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,500
 like the people who spend just hours and hours serving

678
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,140
 and helping widows and orphans,

679
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,940
 like doing and doing and doing.

680
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,200
 Are those all good things?

681
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,920
 Yes, but they're not the thing.

682
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,480
 What Jesus wants is not your works.

683
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,300
 He wants you.

684
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,620
 He wants your heart.

685
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,860
 He wants your devotion, your adoration, your affections.

686
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,380
 He wants you to trust him.

687
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,680
 He wants your love because he loves you.

688
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,120
 He loves you.

689
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,000
 He doesn't want a religious resume.

690
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,880
 And that is the most freeing thing,

691
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,220
 to exhale and go,

692
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,320
 because for years in my life,

693
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,880
 I thought if I just prayed enough,

694
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,360
 if I just talked about God enough,

695
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,960
 if I just came to church enough,

696
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,520
 if I was just the perfect preacher's kid,

697
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,000
 if I did all these right things

698
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 and said all these right things in front of the right people,

699
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,160
 then look, God will be smiling down on me.

700
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,520
 And I kept striving and striving and striving.

701
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,000
 And some of you, you've been striving

702
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,400
 for your relationship with God your whole life

703
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,740
 because it's up to you.

704
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,860
 But he's saying here,

705
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,360
 people are gonna come and just list off all these things

706
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,920
 that they think are impressive

707
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,840
 and that they think they've done in my name.

708
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
 But I don't want a religious resume.

709
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,800
 I want a relationship with you.

710
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,640
 Right now, I'm trying to hire two people

711
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,960
 to work with me at the porch

712
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,140
 and lots of resumes, lots of resumes.

713
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,080
 If it's one of you, I'm sorry we haven't gotten back to you.

714
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,440
 We're working through them.

715
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,600
 And it's so funny, like I do this too.

716
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,400
 I'm an Enneagram three, the achiever.

717
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,680
 We write our resumes.

718
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,200
 What we're doing is we're like thinking

719
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,520
 about the person receiving the resume.

720
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,540
 And so the reality is, is you ran social media

721
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,880
 for your cousin's startup photography business.

722
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,600
 But on the resume, you're like social media manager

723
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,800
 for a local photography business in Dallas, Texas.

724
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,320
 And it's like your cousin's startup.

725
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,000
 And it's like got three followers

726
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,680
 and we'll do anything to make ourselves sound

727
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,940
 more impressive.

728
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,080
 And I think Jesus is saying here, hey,

729
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,860
 you can come before me and try to list up

730
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,160
 all these impressive spiritual acts

731
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,960
 on this religious resume and it doesn't matter.

732
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,300
 I'm not impressed by your deeds.

733
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,640
 I want you, I want you.

734
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:08,220
 Being a Christian is not just doing Christian things.

735
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,560
 It's not just coming to the porch.

736
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,180
 It's not just reading a Devo,

737
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,480
 but it's entering into a real intimate,

738
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,480
 devoted relationship with Jesus.

739
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,900
 So what does that actually look like?

740
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,080
 If it's not these things, if it's not just reading my Bible,

741
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,220
 if it's not just coming to church, then what is it?

742
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,840
 He says this, "Who gets into heaven?

743
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,660
 "Who spends eternity with me?

744
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,900
 "The one who does the will of my father who is in heaven."

745
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,920
 Knowing Jesus, knowing that you know,

746
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,720
 that you know, that you know is doing the will of God.

747
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,400
 And I think every, we get asked all the time here,

748
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,120
 how do I know what God's will is for my life?

749
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,560
 Like, I think we think that there's like three doors

750
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,300
 and God's like, my will is picking the right door

751
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,140
 and it's all up to you.

752
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,760
 And it's like, how do I know which job or which person

753
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,840
 or which thing, which next step, what should I do?

754
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,200
 And we're like, all so concerned

755
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,360
 about God's will for my life, God's will for my life.

756
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,960
 And we're missing the point because God makes his will

757
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,260
 for every Christian's life really simple,

758
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,480
 but it changes everything if you would just do it.

759
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,100
 And it's this, in John chapter six, verse 29,

760
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,120
 Jesus speaking again, it says,

761
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,880
 "This is the only work God wants from you,

762
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,120
 "believe in the one he has sent."

763
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,040
 What's God's will?

764
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,840
 Believing in his son, believing in his plan

765
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,560
 for humanity, believing what we call the gospel,

766
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,560
 the good news that Jesus, God's one and only son

767
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,520
 left heaven and came and stepped down into our dirt,

768
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,680
 into our mess, into our broken world,

769
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,720
 yet he remained perfect, making him the perfect sacrifice

770
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,660
 because our sin deserved a penalty.

771
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,880
 Our sin required a payment for a holy God.

772
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,280
 And Jesus was that perfect payment.

773
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,160
 He was sacrificed on the cross

774
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,480
 and there the wrath of God poured out on him.

775
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,920
 And it should have been us.

776
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,840
 He died in our place.

777
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:26,040
 He came and died and was buried and rose again

778
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 so that we could know him and make him known

779
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,200
 and live forever with him.

780
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,440
 And he says, you wanna know the will of God to believe that?

781
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,520
 To believe the best news ever shared?

782
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,960
 To believe that God is so obsessed with you,

783
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,320
 God loves you so much that he would do anything

784
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,500
 to be with you forever?

785
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,040
 Jesus isn't some dictator up there that's like,

786
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,680
 you, not you, not enough, you, nope, nope, nope.

787
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,720
 He's like, I want all of you, I died for you.

788
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,480
 And if you wanna be with me,

789
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,720
 I just need you to believe, trust, love,

790
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,080
 believe that I am for you, I am with you,

791
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,960
 I died for you, I love you,

792
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,440
 and enter into relationship with me.

793
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,340
 Why is Jesus so obsessed with this idea of belief?

794
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,520
 Like, why does Jesus want us so badly to believe

795
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,640
 that he loves us?

796
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,140
 It's because he knows that radical belief

797
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,200
 produces radical obedience.

798
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,840
 And he knows that belief in him

799
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,100
 determines behavior for him.

800
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,340
 Belief determines our behavior.

801
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,660
 And right now, when you look at your life

802
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,860
 and you look at your behaviors,

803
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
 what does it say about what you believe?

804
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,820
 Do you believe that he is Lord?

805
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,860
 Do you live like he is worthy of your all?

806
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,420
 Do you live like he is worthy of being worshiped?

807
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,100
 Do you say no to the things of the world?

808
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,920
 Do you say no to your own plans

809
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,220
 and live for his plans for your life?

810
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,480
 Do you live according to his word?

811
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,420
 Do you do the things that he wants?

812
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,980
 Do you say no to your sin and yes to him?

813
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,700
 What does your behavior say about your belief in Jesus?

814
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,840
 Because if you believe that he loves you,

815
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,500
 your right response is to receive that

816
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,640
 and respond in loving him in return,

817
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,980
 not loving the world, not loving yourself, loving him.

818
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,360
 When you believe in Jesus, you receive eternal life

819
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,280
 and respond in this life

820
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,320
 and your life begins to produce fruit.

821
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:53,200
 That's when the love of Jesus takes root in your life

822
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,540
 and produces fruit.

823
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:59,460
 When you believe that Jesus died for you and loves you,

824
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,920
 it takes root in your life and it produces behavior,

825
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,760
 it produces fruit of life change.

826
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,060
 Falling in love leads to life change.

827
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,100
 I can testify.

828
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,480
 I fell in love last year.

829
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
 Her name's Jenna, she's not here tonight,

830
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,640
 she's watching online.

831
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,480
 Hey, sweetie.

832
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,420
 And guys, falling in love produces life change.

833
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,720
 Everything's changing about my life.

834
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,460
 Priorities are changing,

835
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,960
 the way I spend my time is changing,

836
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,640
 the way I'm pursuing people is changing,

837
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,960
 the ways that I'm communicating is changing,

838
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,480
 the ways that I'm cleaning things

839
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,180
 and serving in ways that I wasn't before is changing.

840
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,760
 Everything's changing

841
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,080
 because falling in love produces life change.

842
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,060
 Me and her are in this thing right now at Watermark,

843
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,080
 it's a premarital class for eight weeks called Merge.

844
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,160
 I would highly recommend,

845
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,120
 listen, I'm about to be a salesman.

846
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,960
 If you are in a serious relationship

847
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,140
 or about to be engaged

848
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,700
 and you want a God-honoring, God-glorifying marriage,

849
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,800
 do Merge.

850
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,840
 Don't think about it, just do it.

851
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
 It is changing me.

852
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,660
 I'm learning so much, it's amazing.

853
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,320
 Merge, look it up, Watermark website.

854
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
 But at Merge last week,

855
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,720
 we were talking about the roles of husband and wives

856
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,600
 and we sat down and I asked her questions like,

857
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,060
 hey, what can I better do to love and serve you?

858
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,400
 I wasn't asking people that before, I was worried about me.

859
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,240
 But falling in love produces life change.

860
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,600
 She's looking at me and she's asking,

861
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,960
 hey, how can I better support you

862
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,160
 as a leader of our relationship?

863
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,480
 And woof.

864
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,320
 But,

865
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,960
 (congregation laughing)

866
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
 I'm like, you keep asking that,

867
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,200
 you keep asking questions like that,

868
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,280
 you're doing just fine.

869
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,560
 (congregation laughing)

870
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,960
 But we're asking these questions

871
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,720
 and we're doing the hard work

872
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,480
 of communicating and getting things right

873
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,520
 because we're in love.

874
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,440
 And when you're in love, your life changes.

875
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,960
 No more just Saturdays with the bros all the time.

876
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,520
 I gotta ask my lady,

877
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
 can I have a Saturday with the bros?

878
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
 (congregation laughing)

879
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,040
 Things begin to change.

880
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,320
 It's so cool, God's so just sovereign.

881
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,880
 The video that started off Grant,

882
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,260
 that's the, he's gonna be the best man at my wedding.

883
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,100
 My best friend.

884
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,880
 And we had no idea that it was gonna line the night

885
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,200
 that like all of this kind of came together.

886
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,500
 And we were watching the video today before this.

887
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,920
 And he talked about where everything changed for him

888
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
 is when he read Matthew 7,

889
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,640
 right before this part, Jesus said,

890
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,780
 hey, you will know them by their fruit.

891
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,140
 And I was like, Grant, that's what I'm talking about tonight

892
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,580
 that falling in love leads to life change.

893
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,740
 That when a belief in Jesus takes root in one's life,

894
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,480
 it produces fruit that changes you.

895
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,860
 That when you believe in Jesus,

896
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,000
 your behaviors begin to change.

897
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,040
 And guys, Grant tonight is actually sitting

898
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,220
 in the left top corner.

899
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,600
 I can't remember which one he said,

900
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,180
 but he's sitting up there and you know why?

901
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,920
 He's been serving at the porch and doing different things

902
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,100
 and he's sitting up there because he said,

903
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,460
 I wanna remember how far Jesus has brought me.

904
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,420
 Because now he serves down here sometimes.

905
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,340
 And as he watched this story of grace tonight,

906
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,500
 he said, I used to come to the porch,

907
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,600
 professing Jesus with my mouth,

908
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,140
 saying I followed Jesus,

909
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,100
 but there was nothing different in my life.

910
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,900
 And he would come here week after week and sit up there.

911
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,320
 But Jesus was chasing after him.

912
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,060
 Saying, Grant, I want your all.

913
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,540
 I want your heart's affections,

914
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,780
 not your religious actions, I want you.

915
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,700
 And guys, as someone who has been walking closely,

916
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,860
 best man at my wedding,

917
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,140
 I have seen Jesus take so much root in his life.

918
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,340
 There's been so much fruit

919
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,820
 that is just overflowing out of him.

920
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,900
 You heard it in his story.

921
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,100
 And now he's gonna tell more and more people about Jesus.

922
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,500
 That's happening every Tuesday night here

923
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,820
 that someone says, I'm doing it.

924
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,560
 No more wondering, no more questioning,

925
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,320
 no more letting this passage and others like it haunt me.

926
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,320
 I want to know that I know that I know

927
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,080
 that I'm in love with Jesus and he loves me.

928
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,320
 And our lives begin to change.

929
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,500
 Miracles take place every week down here up front.

930
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,880
 And fruit, the fruits of the spirit,

931
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
 the Bible says in Galatians,

932
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,400
 love and joy and peace and patience,

933
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,980
 kindness, gentleness, self-control, faithfulness.

934
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,100
 That's what begins to mark their life.

935
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,000
 That's what begins to come out of them

936
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,380
 because they were changed by Jesus.

937
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,540
 And Jesus is saying, hey,

938
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,140
 you want to spend eternity with me?

939
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
 Know the will of my father.

940
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:49,780
 That's how, believe that he sent me to die for you

941
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,120
 so that you can live for him.

942
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,860
 That night we had given up hope at that ATO party

943
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,980
 and we were walking away just thinking like, you know what?

944
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,980
 I don't think I can, I don't think Connor's gonna come.

945
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,880
 Let's go home.

946
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,100
 And I hear JD.

947
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,420
 And I knew, I knew his voice 'cause we had lived together.

948
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,320
 And I turn around and I see Connor and he's like,

949
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,300
 get in here, they're with me, they're with me.

950
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,820
 And my chest came out and I looked at those pledges.

951
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,180
 I grabbed my friends and I walked through those, the gate.

952
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,660
 Because my relationship with Connor

953
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,740
 gave me the credentials to come into the party.

954
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,540
 That's what I want for you.

955
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:41,700
 I want your relationship with Jesus to define your life

956
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,820
 in such a way

957
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:49,060
 that you get to join the party in heaven

958
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,380
 for all of eternity, lifting up hands, singing to God.

959
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:58,380
 And I want you to know that you know, that you know

960
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,940
 that you're not gonna be someone that Jesus looks at

961
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,900
 and says, hey, I don't know you.

962
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,580
 You're not gonna be someone that just said,

963
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,260
 I'm a Christian, but live like the world.

964
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,620
 You're not gonna be someone that did the things,

965
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,020
 the church things or the Instagram bios

966
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,220
 that said, yeah, I'm a Christian,

967
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,700
 but instead of doing and doing,

968
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,180
 you spent time being intimate and getting to know Jesus.

969
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,340
 And because of that, when that day comes,

970
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,260
 you're so sure because you spent your time on earth

971
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,240
 knowing your Lord in heaven.

972
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,220
 That's my hope.

973
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,040
 If that's not you tonight,

974
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,080
 there is no better time than tonight to get it right.

975
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,620
 To come down front and say, I wanna know,

976
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,180
 I wanna know, I wanna know

977
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,660
 that I get to be with Jesus forever,

978
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,980
 not to get some security of heaven and not hell,

979
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,820
 but 'cause I just am so in love with Jesus

980
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,000
 'cause he loves me.

981
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,740
 That's what you want.

982
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,420
 Jesus is the goal.

983
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,260
 Jesus is the point.

984
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,380
 I just wanna be where he is.

985
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,020
 And if he's gonna be in heaven forever,

986
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,340
 that's where I wanna be.

987
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,660
 That can be true of you tonight.

988
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,680
 John 1:12 says, "But to all who did receive him,

989
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:22,620
 "who called on his holy name,

990
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,300
 "he gave the right to become children of God."

991
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,260
 How can you know that you know Jesus?

992
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,020
 Make him Lord of your life.

993
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,020
 Enter into a relationship with him

994
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,740
 and walk with him till heaven.

995
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,580
 Let's pray.

996
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,160
 God, thank you for your son, Jesus.

997
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,100
 Jesus, we worship you.

998
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,420
 We praise you, Father.

999
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,580
 We praise you that you loved us enough

1000
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,220
 to send your son down to earth to give us this message,

1001
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,340
 a message of hope, a message that says,

1002
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,740
 hey, it is my one desire that I am with

1003
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,860
 every single child in heaven.

1004
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,060
 And so take heed of this warning

1005
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,060
 that many people are gonna come and say, Lord, Lord.

1006
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,820
 I don't want the things that they say, I want them.

1007
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,020
 Many are gonna come and say,

1008
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,380
 but God did and I did and I,

1009
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,660
 and he goes, I don't want the things that you did,

1010
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,500
 I want you.

1011
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:21,140
 So God, if there's someone tonight

1012
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,780
 that thinks it's up to them

1013
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,920
 or thinks that you're not worth it,

1014
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,700
 would you change their heart right now?

1015
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,620
 Would we see you as the prize?

1016
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,920
 Would you see you as worth it?

1017
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,820
 Would we understand your love for us?

1018
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:42,300
 The links that you went through,

1019
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,400
 that you could be in a relationship with us forever.

1020
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,940
 And may that belief in you change our behavior

1021
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,300
 and allow us to respond accordingly.

1022
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,740
 We wanna be people who know you

1023
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,020
 and to let what we know to be true,

1024
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,100
 to change how we live forever until heaven.

1025
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,180
 We are living for heaven.

1026
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,340
 We are living for you.

1027
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,440
 We worship you.

1028
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,060
 We worship with the angels

1029
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,340
 and all of your people in heaven right now.

1030
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,620
 In your name that I pray, amen.

1031
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,660
 Let's stand and sing.
