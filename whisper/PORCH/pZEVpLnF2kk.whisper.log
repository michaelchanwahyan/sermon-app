[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.880]   - All right.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.720]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.560]   Hey, guys.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.480]   Good to see y'all.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.600]   See, I like this because normally at church,
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.680]   when they tell you to greet people,
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.280]   you like nod at one person.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.600]   You're like, "Greetings," and then sit.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080]   Y'all were like making connections, exchanging numbers.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.920]   This was fun.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.620]   Well, hey, it is an honor to be here with you.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.920]   Like I said earlier, my name's Ben Stewart.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.600]   I'm a pastor, just moved to Washington, D.C.,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.160]   so pray for us.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.000]   My wife and I moved up there
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.760]   because it's a city of young people.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580]   One out of every three people in the district
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.840]   is between the ages of 20 and 35.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.000]   And we moved there because my passion and heartbeat
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.760]   is to meet people right in your range of life,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.960]   many of you, that are making huge decisions
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.680]   and are willing to leverage your life
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.880]   for some things that matter most.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.760]   So it's exciting for us to be there,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.960]   but man, it's good to be home back in Texas.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   It's good to be here at The Porch
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080]   because I know many of you know this,
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.720]   but if you're visiting and don't,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.000]   the leadership here is absolutely incredible.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.680]   And these are some amazing men and women.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.200]   Jonathan Picluda, one of God's gifts
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.880]   to young people alive today.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.520]   And man, last time I was here,
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.440]   The Porch was just a humble little ministry
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.040]   to thousands of people in Dallas.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.480]   And now you're like in El Paso and Oklahoma
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.520]   and Switzerland and everywhere else.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.960]   And in Houston, which is just amazing.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.080]   And so if you're in Houston watching this,
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.040]   we're praying for you and we love you.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.320]   And we're with you as you're going through
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.000]   all that's ahead of you in the days to come recovery.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.280]   And it's an honor to pray with you.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.160]   And man, what a cool place to be.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.920]   So love you guys, honored to be here,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.000]   honored to jump in right at the front end of a series
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.840]   on dating and relationships
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.200]   and to see what God might do with our time together.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.440]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump in together.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.280]   Sound good?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.240]   Father, I wanna thank you for every person here.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.280]   God, whether they're here and church is their favorite thing,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.800]   they mark it on the calendar,
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000]   little alarms go off every Sunday
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.160]   that they can't wait to be in church, they love this place.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.680]   Or whether they're here and aren't sure
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.840]   to think about any of this.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.040]   Wherever we land on the spectrum of how we deal
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.560]   with rooms like this and moments like this,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.000]   I just thank you God that we're here.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.440]   In all different rooms in Fort Worth and El Paso
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.720]   and different places, we're here.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.000]   And you've given us a moment to pause
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.280]   and to think about what our God thinks about us.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.520]   And God, I pray as we think about what you think about
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.480]   that we would care about what you care about.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.280]   And so God, I'm asking tonight
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.520]   that you not just change our thinking,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.960]   but you change the way we feel and change the way we live.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.440]   God, I feel like you want some young men and women
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.480]   to be different forever tonight, that this is their night.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.960]   And I can't produce that, the porch can't, but you can God.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.240]   And I just feel that tonight.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.720]   And we just say yes to that God.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.640]   And I wanna invite you if you're willing,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.240]   you would take a minute and just ask him,
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.780]   say God, please teach me something tonight.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.080]   (whispering)
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.420]   And then if you would, please pray for me
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.140]   that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.740]   Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.520]   Use this time and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.740]   Well, I became a youth pastor right out of college.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.020]   And one of my favorite things to do
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.060]   is to take our students rappelling.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.500]   And we would take them to some mountain
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.420]   somewhere in Colorado, and we'd go with one
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.980]   of those outfitters that had all the gear,
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.580]   had all the guides, and they would strap our kids in
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.580]   and then send them off the sides of cliffs.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.140]   But every time we did it, these guys would circle us up
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.340]   and they'd give us the speech.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.380]   And it always started the same way.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.540]   The guide would get up front and he would say,
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.140]   I want you to know, every guide here today
[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.500]   has been sending children off the side of mountains
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.100]   for over a decade.
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.620]   In that time, we've never lost a man, woman, or child.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.840]   None of you will die today on the rocks below.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.060]   Do you believe this?
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.680]   And as they would say it, all of us were like,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.380]   we know, we know, we know, 'cause we'd heard it before.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.900]   But he's undaunted.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.820]   He would say, and this rope could hold over 6,000 pounds
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.500]   of weight, it could hold up a Buick with all of you
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.480]   inside it, wouldn't snap, twist, bend, break in the slightest.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.380]   No one will die 'cause of faulty equipment today.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.100]   And we were like, we know, we know.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.780]   And on he would go to the Caribbeaners and whatnot,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.340]   just explaining that we were gonna make it alive today.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.020]   And we would all say we know 'cause we'd heard it.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.420]   And then, when it came time to repel down the mountain,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.540]   and many of you have been repelling.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.340]   You know, when you repel, you don't climb down a mountain.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.860]   You lean back onto the rope and you descend.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.380]   As soon as that moment would start,
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.120]   half of the people would totally freak out.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.420]   And weirdly, it was usually the guys.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.700]   Which I don't know why that was.
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.700]   Like, I don't know if the guys just weren't paying attention
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.260]   during the instructions, like, wait, what are we doing?
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.420]   You know, or that.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.020]   Or if it was the fact that the guide was like
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.980]   this young, cute guy that had huge biceps,
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.900]   like apparently everyone who works at Watermark.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.220]   And he would just look in the girls' eyes and be like,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.420]   just go ahead and lean back.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.540]   And they were like, okay.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.380]   And just off they would go.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.440]   Like, all right.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.140]   But it was the weirdest thing.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.540]   Like, these guys would get to the edge of the cliff
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.900]   and they would get there and they would just go,
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.100]   wait, no, wait, no, stop.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.620]   And you're like, like something was wrong.
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.300]   And you'd be like, what?
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.140]   Is the rope breaking?
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.980]   No.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.100]   Is the carabiner snapping?
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.940]   No.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.540]   Did he suddenly forget what he's doing?
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.540]   No.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.900]   And yet on they would go, wait, hold on, no, wait, wait.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.220]   And they would end up prolonging
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.320]   the absolute least enjoyable part of the experience.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.340]   And it was a fascinating thing to watch.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.500]   And you go, why are you even bringing this up?
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.540]   What does this have to do with anything?
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.320]   Because here's the deal.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.580]   30 minutes before, you believe you're gonna make it.
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.960]   Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.340]   But when it comes time to trust it,
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.440]   your actions betray what you really believe.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.260]   You go, why are you talking about that?
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.040]   Because in 1 John, we're in this series,
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.000]   kicking off this series, which I love this idea
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.620]   where it says, first comes love.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.340]   And in 1 John, the word love shows up 46 times.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.100]   46 times, John talks about love.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.780]   27 of them in the passage we're gonna look at tonight
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.860]   in 1 John chapter four.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.180]   And so the simple message of tonight is this.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.980]   If you wanna know in advance, what's the message?
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.180]   Here's the message.
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.540]   You are loved.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.620]   And if you are in Christ, the most beautiful,
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.060]   powerful being in existence cherishes you.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.580]   He likes you.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.060]   He knows your name and he sees you tonight.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.220]   But my guess is, when many of you hear that,
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.680]   you would say, I know.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.220]   Like, that's your message tonight?
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.940]   Did you know God loves you?
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.700]   Uh, yeah.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.260]   You flew here for that?
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.460]   Yes, I knew that.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.020]   And yet, it's a fascinating thing.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.340]   In 1 John four, he begins to tell us,
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.780]   he says in verse 16, so we have come to know
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.980]   and believe in the love God has for us.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.260]   And then he gives us two attributes
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.420]   that characterize those who know
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.620]   and believe that God loves them.
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.580]   The first one's in verse 18.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.220]   He says, there's no fear in love,
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.780]   but perfect love casts out fear,
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.460]   for fear has to do with punishment,
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.940]   and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.780]   He says, the people who know and believe
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:01.660]   they are loved by God are characterized by a fearlessness.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.060]   They're not an anxious people.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.060]   The people who know that they know
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.380]   they're loved by God aren't stressed,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.780]   not fearful, not anxious.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.940]   There's a wonderful, sweet confidence about them.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.600]   And not only are they fearless, they're free.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.420]   They're free to love other people.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.480]   And you see it in verse seven of the same chapter.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.740]   He says, beloved, let us love one another,
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.620]   for love is from God, and whoever loves
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.140]   has been born of God and knows God.
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.540]   Fascinating thing about that.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.140]   He says, beloved, let us love one another.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.780]   And then he gives you a reason why, for,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.100]   and he's gonna tell you why we should love one another.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.260]   But it's a fascinating thing.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.300]   He doesn't point downstream.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.780]   He doesn't say love one another,
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.620]   and then God will reward you.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.720]   Love one another, or else God will be mad and punish you.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.300]   There's no pleasure offered or no threat offered,
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.440]   but he gives a reason.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.280]   What is it?
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.820]   He says love one another, why?
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.900]   Because love is from God.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.900]   He points upstream.
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.100]   And everyone who knows God and loves God loves others.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.860]   The beloved love.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.780]   Love embraced becomes love extended.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.740]   It's the most natural thing.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.460]   So those people who know and believe that God loves them
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.320]   have a freedom to love other people.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.620]   They walk into rooms like this with open hearts
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.060]   and open hands to care about the other
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.500]   and the issues going on in your life.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.940]   And so it's fascinating.
[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.620]   If I gave you a quiz tonight,
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.340]   did you know you're loved by God?
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.100]   I bet most of you would get it right.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.460]   Are you loved by God, true or false?
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.300]   True!
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:51.860]   But if I said, so your life is characterized
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.520]   by a fearlessness and freedom to love other people,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.420]   I bet a lot of people in here would back away from that.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.460]   Well, I don't know if that's true
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.940]   of how I roll into work every day.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.860]   But those are the exact characteristics
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.580]   that are indicative of the person who knows
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.380]   and believes they're loved by God.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.020]   So we say, yeah, I know it,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.820]   but our actions betray what we really believe
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.860]   because here's the reality.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.540]   We are afraid.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.020]   We're an anxious people.
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.940]   And young people today have record levels of anxiety.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.760]   Did you know that?
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.420]   Far more than your predecessors in this country.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.880]   Anxiety marks this young generation.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.360]   We are a fearful people.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.540]   And you see it in dating.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.800]   All the time when I talk to young people about dating,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.660]   afraid that I'm gonna mess it up
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.300]   'cause I saw my parents mess up their marriage.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.380]   Afraid that marriage might mess up my life.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.820]   I have goals and somebody might derail me.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.220]   Afraid I'm gonna miss out.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.940]   Afraid that I'll never be satisfied.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.420]   Afraid I'm not gonna meet the one.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.820]   Afraid that if I commit to the one,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.940]   I'll miss out on the other.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.880]   Afraid I won't be sexually fulfilled.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.180]   There's so much fear that marks our intimacy
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.820]   with one another, right?
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.760]   And because we're fearful, we're an anxious people.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.200]   And because we're an anxious people,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.460]   we're not free to love other people.
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.600]   So we walk into rooms like this.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.800]   And rather than thinking about,
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.760]   I wonder how you're doing
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.040]   and how I can bless you in your life.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.480]   We're worried about how do I look?
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.320]   Who sees me?
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.140]   Who noticed me?
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.980]   Who liked my post?
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.880]   Who sees me?
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.000]   Who values me?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.180]   And we do things every day.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.280]   We say things.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.440]   And what's our sifting criteria for what we say?
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.960]   It's whether or not they'll think I'm funny.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.800]   They'll think I'm cool.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.720]   They'll think I'm wise.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.640]   They'll think I'm valuable.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.720]   They'll think I'm someone worth appreciating.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.060]   I will be loved.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.600]   We come in with a vacancy looking to fill it.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.180]   Why?
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.280]   Because we are fearful.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.480]   And we aren't free.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.080]   And we're more insecure and inwardly focused
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.760]   than we are fearless and free.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.480]   And here's the tragedy about that.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.160]   The world is in desperate need of selfless love.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.600]   It is.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.880]   But you can't be a source if you don't have a source.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.720]   You can't.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.700]   So I remember a couple years ago,
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.100]   I had a friend go scuba diving.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.640]   And she went with one of those crazy unsafe deals
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.520]   they do in the Caribbean where there's like,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.260]   they just give you a 30 minute crash course on scuba,
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.020]   you know, and then just set you free in the ocean.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.800]   And so she did that and they paired her up.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.360]   They give you a swim buddy and they paired her up
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.040]   with this middle-aged guy.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.400]   And they both have their own scuba tanks,
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.880]   but you're supposed to be swim buddies,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.400]   you know, and point at fish together
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.960]   and just sort of enjoy the ocean together
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.240]   and just swim along.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.440]   And then if there's a problem,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.160]   they give you like a series of gestures.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.600]   I don't know what it is to let one another
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.920]   if there's a problem.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.160]   But the two of them are swimming along
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.900]   and then all of a sudden,
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.680]   something fails with this oxygen tank.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.720]   Oxygen quits flowing, can't breathe.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.880]   Now there was a protocol, series of hand gestures
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.520]   and then a slow ascent to the surface
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.040]   as they share her aerator.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.880]   But as soon as he realized, man, there was a desperation,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.320]   panic set in.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.160]   Scarcity led to desperation,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.760]   desperation, exploitation.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.200]   He just grabbed her, began to shake her.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.800]   And she's like, what is he doing?
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.220]   And then he grabbed the aspirator out of her mouth
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.120]   and shoved it into his mouth.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   And then he began to try to climb her like a ladder
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.200]   to get out of the water, which doesn't really work.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.920]   What he was doing was drowning her, right?
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.960]   And so she was trying to figure out what is happening.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.240]   This is not the hand gesture.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.580]   And so finally she's having to like hit him back, right?
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.800]   To get him loose.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.500]   And in a moment of panic, he just grabbed her
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.280]   because she had the oxygen tank on
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.520]   and he just swam full speed up to the top.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.360]   Didn't adjust at all for depth,
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.160]   gave both of them the bends, they got sick, right?
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.880]   And so after that, they were no longer swim buddies
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:41.360]   or any kind of buddies for that matter, right?
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.800]   And he go, but what happened?
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.120]   That scarcity led to desperation.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.880]   That desperation, exploitation, right?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.480]   If I have a source of life, I can be a source of life.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.320]   If I lack a source of life,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.920]   I'm gonna use you to try to get life.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.840]   And you go, what does any of this have to do with dating?
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   This is the foundation of it.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.280]   This is why so many relationships go wrong.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.480]   I come in empty looking for fulfillment.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.880]   And so I have nothing to give to you.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.480]   I'm trying to suck from you, meaning value acceptance for me
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.920]   and I don't have much to give you.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.800]   And I watched so many people get together
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.920]   that are trying to suck life out of one another
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.080]   and that desperation leads to exploitation
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.240]   and it doesn't last.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.440]   And there's a better way
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.000]   that love must first be embraced before it can be extended.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.120]   If I get a source of love, I can be a source of love.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.880]   And if I have an eternal source of love,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.080]   I can be an endless lover of you.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.360]   And that's where healthy relationships start.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.680]   You will never get a relationship with a guy or a girl,
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   right, if you don't get a relationship with God right first.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.320]   And so as I prayed about coming here tonight,
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.880]   there was so much I wanted to talk about,
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.520]   about dating, like communication,
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.880]   and so many of the unique challenges with technology
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.000]   and all these things, but I realized all that
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.480]   is just kind of tweaking the dials
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.840]   on a tank that doesn't work.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.000]   You gotta get this right first, right?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.600]   And yet some of us hear this and you go,
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.640]   well Ben, I want that.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.800]   I wanna feel loved by God.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.240]   I wanna have a love of God that'll be the foundation
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.640]   of a healthy relationship.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.320]   You saw on the woman at the well,
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.520]   when Jesus came to her and he began to speak to her
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.960]   about thirst, he said, go call your husband.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.880]   She didn't have one.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.880]   He said, no, you've had five.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.080]   And now you're living with a guy that's not your husband.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.920]   And he's not shaming her in that moment.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   Then he begins to talk to her about a deep soul thirst
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.260]   that he can satisfy.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.280]   What's Jesus doing?
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.280]   He's saying to her, you've been looking in the arms of men
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.200]   for what only God can give.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.240]   You've misdiagnosed your need.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.440]   You have to get a relationship with me right
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.400]   before you'll get a relationship with them right.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.000]   And that's where we have to start.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.200]   And I know some of you want that.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.960]   Like I don't wanna be insecure.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.800]   I don't wanna walk in the room self-absorbed
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.200]   and always feel like I'm not adding up.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.080]   I don't wanna come in trying to get people
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.040]   to approve of me like me.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.560]   I wanna be someone who is free to love other people
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.600]   in this world because I've been freely loved
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.280]   with the inexhaustible love of God.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.960]   I wanna feel that way.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.120]   How do I feel it?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.560]   How do I feel loved?
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.000]   Well, the subjective affections burn off the fuel
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.040]   of objective truth.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.360]   Feelings burn off truth.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.640]   If you wanna feel loved, you need to know you are.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.280]   And you go, well, how do I know that?
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.640]   Well, take it out of the supernatural for a minute.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.560]   Take it out of the love of God.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.540]   How do you know you're loved by anybody?
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.600]   How do you know love exists?
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.800]   Can't see it, can't touch it.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.640]   What do you got there?
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.480]   A little cup of love, got it for you.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.320]   Can't do that.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.280]   So how do you know love exists?
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.880]   Anywhere, in any relationship,
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.680]   how do you know it's working, right?
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.280]   Some of you would say, Ben, love is like the wind.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.640]   You can't see it and yet you feel the effects of it, right?
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.000]   And you'd be right.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.680]   Think about your favorite books,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   your favorite romantic movies.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.120]   When they wanna show you love exists, what do they do?
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.300]   I would submit to you they do three things.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.160]   To show you love exists so that you know it and believe it.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.040]   The first thing they show you is that love sends.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.600]   It sends, love initiates, love cannot sit still.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   Love moves towards the beloved.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.840]   Love sends texts, it sends emails.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.240]   You will never see a guy
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.960]   when he suddenly realizes he loves a girl,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.400]   not that she thinks she's cute or has some potential,
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.040]   but that he really loves her,
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.000]   like this is it, cashing out of singleness, love her.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.060]   You will never see him sitting on his couch
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.680]   and realize that, I love her.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.500]   Weird.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:50.060]   Now, he's gonna rise and go to his beloved
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.660]   because that's what love does.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.260]   Love sends text messages, it sends emails,
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.380]   it sends flowers, it sends the vibe.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.340]   How you doing, baby, right?
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.440]   That's what love does.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:05.540]   Princess Buttercup says,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.220]   "I know my Wesley will come for me."
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.280]   How does she know?
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.860]   Because it's true love.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.860]   [audience laughing]
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.880]   And when the beloved is over there,
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.720]   the lover will not sit still.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.040]   The lover moves towards the beloved
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.180]   and that's how you know love exists.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.660]   It sends and it sacrifices.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.340]   Love will give itself for the beloved.
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.560]   So Jack will give up his life
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.500]   so that Rose can stay afloat on that door
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.940]   after the Titanic sinks.
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.760]   And some of you going,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.340]   "Isn't there enough room on that door for two?"
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.260]   No, just no, just Rose.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.300]   And that's it, but he did it, right?
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.900]   Frozen, Anna will step in front of that falling sword.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.980]   Why?
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.580]   Because it's true love that falls the frozen heart, right?
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.440]   Bruno Mars, step in front of a train for you.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.440]   He'll catch a grenade for you.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.680]   Think about that.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.980]   That's a pretty grim picture.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.580]   Why would he say that?
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.700]   Because he knows that we know
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.260]   when you're willing to sacrifice like that,
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.780]   true love exists.
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.820]   It will surrender its body to the flames for the beloved.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.340]   And true love stays, it stays.
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.380]   It delights in the beloved
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.300]   and will stay even when it's hard.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.900]   So Noah will stay and read the notebook to Allie
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.300]   even though she has Alzheimer's and can't remember who he is.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.660]   I had to read my notes on that one, guys.
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.540]   If you don't know what that one is, I didn't know either.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.540]   But think about our wedding vows.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.940]   What do we say when we wanna declare
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.600]   before God and all of our friends
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.300]   we truly love the person we're up there with?
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.540]   What do we say?
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.860]   For richer or poorer, for better or for worse,
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.540]   in sickness and in health.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.740]   Why do we say that?
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.620]   Because all of us understand when someone declares,
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.660]   I'm staying with you if it's good and when it's not.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.260]   I'm staying with you when it's great and when it's hard.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.100]   I'm staying with you even when everyone else walks out.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:35.100]   When we declare that, everybody knows true love exists
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.980]   because love stays.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.640]   It sends, it sacrifices, it stays.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.500]   And all the movies you love
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.580]   will keep going back to those things.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:46.420]   Why?
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.940]   Because they know that we know
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.860]   that when you see those things, you know love exists.
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.080]   Why am I saying this?
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.340]   First John 4, 9.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.840]   In this is love.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.800]   In this the love of God was made manifest among us.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.960]   That word manifest, the root of it is the word light.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.640]   When something happened, when this occurred,
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.080]   it shined a light on the reality
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.680]   that we're loved by God tonight.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   And for some of you,
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.000]   I'm praying that light goes on right now.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.160]   In this, the love of God was made manifest.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.520]   It was made manifest before us.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.920]   What?
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   That God sent his only son into the world
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.620]   that we might live through him.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.960]   Love sends.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.640]   And God sent his son.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.680]   Didn't send a text, didn't send an email,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.080]   didn't stop at just a prophet or a book.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.520]   He sent the best messenger he had.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.200]   He sent his son.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.560]   The arrival of Jesus Christ on the planet
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.320]   is exhibit A of God's love for you.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.640]   He will come from heaven to earth to live among us.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.480]   Why?
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.040]   Because that's what love does.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.920]   In this, the love of God is manifest.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.480]   That he sent his son.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.320]   Why?
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.420]   So that we might live through him.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.920]   It's interesting to be in a city like DC
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.280]   and I've been there two weeks
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.560]   and already when people even hear that I'm a pastor,
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.600]   they start to put me in a lane where they think
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.440]   I'm someone who's just trying to read you a book
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.320]   to make you be a better person.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.260]   And that's not what Christianity is.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.880]   It's not read some rules
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.080]   and approximate your life to its teachings.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.020]   It's being raptured by a man who came for you.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.920]   Be devastated by the beauty of a love of one
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.380]   who would come this far for you.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.280]   How do you know you're loved by God?
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.240]   Love sends.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.180]   Love sends.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.660]   How do you know you're loved?
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.780]   Love sacrifices.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.220]   Verse 10.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.700]   In this is love.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.020]   Not that we love God,
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.980]   but he loved us and sent his son
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.760]   to be the propitiation for our sins.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.420]   Now propitiation's a big word, so let me explain it.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.140]   It says here's how love is manifest by God.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.280]   He leapt over two barriers.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.480]   The first barrier God leapt over
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.120]   was our indifference to him.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.980]   And the second barrier he leapt over
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.240]   was his anger over the horrible broken things
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.940]   we've done to each other.
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.080]   That Jesus sacrificed for us,
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.000]   took on brokenness because of our brokenness.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.840]   Why?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.960]   Because love sacrifices, that's what it does.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.260]   And it grabs this word propitiation
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.400]   because it's temple imagery of a sacrifice, right?
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.980]   It's interesting, the more I talk to people
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.300]   who don't know Jesus, don't care about religion,
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.040]   I never have to argue with them that we're not okay.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.380]   Everybody believes there's something wrong with us.
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.300]   Everybody does.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.660]   Science backs it up.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.820]   Yale has an infant cognition center.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.560]   And at Yale's infant cognition center,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.700]   you can read about it on Google,
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.300]   they've done studies to realize
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.460]   there is a morality in babies.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.380]   Three month old, four month old, pre-verbal babies,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.400]   a rough morality is present from the womb.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.640]   And you go, how did they even know that
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.840]   if the kids can't talk?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.300]   I can't go into all the details of it,
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.020]   it would take too long, Google it, read it.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.580]   But basically what they do is these little morality plays
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.900]   with puppets.
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.660]   One puppet will share, another will steal.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.420]   One puppet will help, another will hit, right?
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.980]   And then they present these puppets to the babies.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.400]   And way beyond statistical significance,
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.940]   almost 100% certitude, they said it's fascinating,
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.940]   these pre-verbal babies,
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.100]   when they saw these morality plays played out,
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.140]   it's not just when they were offered the puppets,
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.740]   they preferred the good one.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.860]   When they saw the good one, they would laugh,
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.820]   they would smile, they instantly saw good as beautiful,
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.620]   they would hug him.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.700]   When they saw the mean puppet that stole and hurt people,
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.540]   they would cry, they would hit it.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.740]   They instinctively knew it should be judged.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.560]   And so these people at Yale are like,
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.120]   there's morality woven into us from birth.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.260]   And they were like, so here's the big question,
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.000]   if all of us know what is good and beautiful
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.160]   and what is bad and ugly, if we know that from birth,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.160]   why do we all choose the bad?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.240]   And Yale said, we don't know.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   They can't test that.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.720]   But the Bible tells us that all of us like sheep
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.480]   have gone astray, there's something wrong with all of us.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.120]   Alexander Solzhenitsyn said it,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.960]   if only there were evil people out there
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.160]   insidiously committing evil deeds
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.920]   and all that were necessary to do
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.020]   would be to separate them and destroy them.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.160]   But the line dividing good and evil
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   cuts through the heart of every human being, it does.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.360]   There's something wrong with all of us,
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.340]   we know we're not okay.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.140]   And the truth is some of you,
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.760]   the shame of your sexual failure
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.180]   is what's kept you from singing
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.580]   every time you come to the porch.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.760]   I see it all the time.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.660]   We know something's wrong with us
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.540]   and it saps away strength and joy.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.820]   And I'm so tired of seeing it do it
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.940]   to young people with so much life, shame, steals, joy.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.500]   And we all know something's wrong with us
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.000]   and we all know we can't fix it.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.920]   I remember when my wife and I visited Italy.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.000]   We were visiting one night
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.780]   and one night we went to this little town in Cinque Terre,
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.180]   sat out by the water at this little venue
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.560]   and we had dinner together
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.720]   and there were these yuppies sitting next to us.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.880]   And I use the technical term,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.320]   they were young, urban, professional women from London.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.520]   Just like you, young, successful women from London
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.120]   and they were there and they were texting their friends,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.800]   they were about to go party that night
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.620]   and my wife and I were sitting having dinner
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.640]   and they were over there and they're like,
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.480]   oh, where are you from?
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.300]   Oh, where are you from?
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.140]   Oh, where have you been?
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:07.960]   Oh, what have we seen?
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.880]   And after a while we scooted our tables together
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.840]   and we started telling stories,
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.680]   we started laughing.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.800]   After that, they texted their friends,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.320]   canceled their plans, we all hung out.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.880]   By the end of it, we had closed out the restaurant,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.000]   the manager had come out, his son was serenading us
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.560]   and playing us some liqueur he had made
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.600]   out of like Drano or something.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.640]   It was really not good.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.560]   But we just had this crazy party that night.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.100]   And about an hour into it,
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.520]   they asked me, what do you do for a living?
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.120]   Which I love that it took an hour
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.780]   'cause if you ask me in the first five minutes
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.840]   and I say, well, I'm a preacher,
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.520]   boom, like kills the conversation.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.540]   But an hour in, we had a chance to establish
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.640]   a base of coolness, you know what I mean?
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.520]   And so she asked, what do you do?
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.520]   And I said, I teach the Bible to young people.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.240]   And she went, why?
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.400]   And her friend like hit her and I was like,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.240]   no, that's totally fine.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.200]   She was like, can I just tell you,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.840]   I've never read the Bible ever and none of them have.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.560]   And then the other one said, well, I have a question.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.480]   And I said, well, what is it?
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.160]   And she said, why do religious people kill people?
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.500]   Why do religious people kill people?
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.240]   Because a terrorist had just blown himself up in the tube
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.080]   where some of her friends go to work.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.880]   And I said, well, I don't kill people.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.960]   I said, but I'll tell you this,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.520]   if you take any human philosophy,
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.780]   from Christianity to atheism to everywhere in between,
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.020]   they can all be twisted and turn dark.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.080]   There's terrorist Hindus and Buddhists.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.540]   And if anyone should be cooled out,
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.680]   it's like the Hindus, right?
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.460]   I mean, like you got terrorists from every philosophy
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.040]   in human existence can be turned dark.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.780]   I think what that shows you
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.120]   is that there's something wrong with us.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.280]   And you know what's fascinating?
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.420]   She said, you're right.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.660]   She said, I don't understand what,
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.200]   there are things I want to stop doing and I keep doing them.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   And I don't even know why I keep doing the things
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.160]   I don't want to do.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.000]   And she had no idea she was quoting Romans 7.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   [audience laughing]
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.700]   And then she looked at me and said, what's the solution?
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.120]   How do we fix it?
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.000]   And in the Old Testament, they had a picture.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.400]   And the picture was in the center of Jerusalem,
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.720]   the city of peace, there was the temple of God.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.440]   And in the center of the temple of God
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.480]   was a room called the holiest of holies.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.000]   And in the center of that room was a box.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.640]   And in that box was the perfection of God etched into stone.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.700]   And no one could obey that perfection.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.040]   So no one was allowed in that room.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.640]   And it was a picture of our distance
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.880]   from who we were meant to be before God,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.280]   because we're all wrong.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.320]   Except for one day a year,
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   the priest would take the blood of an innocent lamb,
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.400]   a lamb would die for us.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.420]   It would pay for what we've done.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.600]   And he would take that blood
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.360]   and he would put it on the lid of that box.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.520]   And it was a picture that when God looks down,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.280]   he no longer sees his violated law,
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.960]   he sees the payment of an innocent one for our violation,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.500]   and communion with God can be restored.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.280]   That lid had a name, the hilasterion,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.680]   the mercy seat, the propitiation.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.960]   He says, Jesus Christ became that lid.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.640]   He said, you're all wrong and distant from God,
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.360]   and the source has been cut off,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.800]   and that eternal love can't flow through you,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.480]   but I will come live the perfect life you could not,
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.520]   and the debts you've incurred, I will pay.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.440]   How do you know you're loved by God?
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.160]   He sacrificed for us.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.720]   So right out of college,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.160]   I had a friend who was great with money,
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.000]   in every way the opposite of me right out of college.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.720]   Like we lived together as roommates,
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.080]   and he would be in his room,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.200]   like with all of his receipts,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   and like a spreadsheet,
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.680]   one of those little like visors,
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.360]   that's green, and like a little like,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.040]   you know, abacus, and he's just like doing his finances.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.240]   And I was like, I've never seen anyone do that.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   And I'm not saying you should be like me,
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.200]   it was not a good place financially,
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.800]   but he was just so responsible.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.520]   He knew his credit score, always.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.240]   [congregation laughing]
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.200]   And I watched him fall in love with a girl.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.400]   And he fell in love with a girl
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.120]   that through very irresponsible decisions in college,
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.040]   had racked up an enormous mountain of debt.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.720]   And I watched them struggle.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.440]   That he knew if I marry her,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.440]   I have to pay back this debt for decades.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.680]   And she had a difficult family life.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.960]   Like they had to have security and police
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.400]   at their wedding difficult.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.800]   And he knew if I take that on,
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.580]   that doesn't get un-messy easily.
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.360]   And I watched my friend see the cost,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.480]   and I watched him gladly pay it.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.960]   First time I ever cried in a wedding.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.080]   'Cause I saw him up there,
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.800]   and I knew what it was costing him,
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.320]   but he didn't care.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.800]   He didn't rub it in like,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.960]   yeah, for better or for worse.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.760]   [congregation laughing]
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.880]   He stood up there beaming,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.720]   because he said,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.120]   "I will take any cost for my beloved."
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.160]   That's what love does.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.460]   How do you know you're loved?
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.600]   Look at the cross.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.240]   It's Jesus Christ running for you.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.760]   Him seeing an obstacle of your sin
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.840]   that's stealing your joy and strength.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.680]   And he says, "I'll take it from you.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.960]   I'll absorb that debt for you.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.160]   He who knew no sin became sin for us,
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.600]   so that we might be right with God."
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.200]   How do you know you're loved?
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.920]   Because he sacrificed for us.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.000]   And greater love has no man than this,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.400]   that he would lay down his life for his friends.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.180]   So the latest naval warship
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.280]   is called the USS Michael Monsoor.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.500]   And it's called that because in 2006,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.880]   Michael Monsoor's Navy SEAL team was challenged
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.140]   with clearing out insurgents from Ramadi.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.340]   And in one moment, while he was on a roof
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.220]   with some of his teammates,
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.980]   a terrorist took a grenade
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.200]   and threw it in the midst of Michael and his friends.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.040]   And Michael, without hesitation,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.420]   dove on the grenade, absorbed its blast,
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.780]   in doing so, losing his own life, but saving all of theirs.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.500]   They gave his family the Medal of Honor,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.020]   highest award our country will give to somebody.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.280]   And as the president read about what he did, he said this,
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.380]   "Death came that day for Mikey's friends.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.900]   And Mikey said, 'You cannot take my brothers.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.580]   I will go in their stead.'"
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.980]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.240]   Do you think those men right now wonder if Michael loved them?
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.820]   You think they question if he valued them?
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.480]   If they do, they can remember that day.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.300]   Do you question if heaven smiles on you?
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.620]   Do you lay alone in bed and wonder if anybody cares?
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.740]   Look at the cross.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.020]   Greater love has no one than this,
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.160]   that he'd lay down his life for his friends.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.100]   And that's what God does.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.980]   Love sends, it sacrifices, and then it stays.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.740]   He says in verse 13, "By this we know we abide in him,
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:44.940]   and he in us, he's given us his spirit."
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.640]   When you put your faith in Christ, God says,
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.860]   "I stay with you for better or for worse,
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.840]   sickness and in health, I stay."
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:57.040]   So I met a couple when I was in high school,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.100]   the most beautiful couple I'd ever seen in life.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.060]   I mean like intimidating beautiful.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.420]   And I don't know if some of you know it,
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.960]   like the kind of beautiful that like stops
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.620]   all conversations in the room.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:10.060]   Have you ever seen people like that?
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:10.900]   As you're talking with your friends,
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.700]   you're like, "So anyway, I said this to them."
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.300]   [audience laughing]
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.020]   The kind of people that make you instantly self-conscious
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.200]   when they walk up, they're like, "Hey guys."
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.800]   You're like, "Hey, why am I so stupid and weird
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.640]   and ugly and ah!"
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.900]   And you're like, "What?"
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.960]   And they didn't put that on me.
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:30.040]   But they were nice.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.200]   They were the easiest couple to cheer for.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.880]   He was a pro athlete, she was a model or should have been,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.280]   I don't know, but they were amazing.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.600]   [audience laughing]
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.480]   And they were gonna get married, we were all gonna go,
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.080]   the most beautiful wedding in existence.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.140]   And then on the way there, they find out she's got MS.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.400]   And she starts to have trouble using her hands.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.920]   And as their wedding day got closer,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.100]   she couldn't lift her arms to comb her own hair.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:01.300]   So she took him and she told him,
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.840]   "You didn't sign up for this.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.800]   "You don't have to do this.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.600]   "There's a difficulty that comes with me
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.500]   "that's not gonna get easy and you don't have to do this."
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.220]   And he told her, "No."
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.040]   "No, I want you."
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.100]   It's the second wedding I ever cried in.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.340]   [audience laughing]
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:29.400]   'Cause I watched as she choked up on the word sickness
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.900]   when it was time to say in sickness and in health.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.540]   He didn't.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:37.360]   He looked her right in the eye and said,
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.960]   "In sickness and in health, for better and for worse,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.980]   "I am not going anywhere."
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.820]   And that's what God just said to you.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.100]   Do you see it?
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.900]   It's what he just said.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.200]   He knows what you are.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.020]   Some of you, that lie in your head says,
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.040]   "Well, he wouldn't love me if he knows what I've done.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.480]   "Well, he forgave me when I was a kid,
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.820]   "but look how far I'm gone."
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:00.660]   He knows what he got with you.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.340]   He's not shocked and surprised.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.220]   I forgive, oh, I didn't know what you were into.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.060]   Sorry.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.060]   [audience laughing]
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:14.580]   Don't belittle the sacrifice of Jesus
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.420]   by pretending your sin is too big.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.460]   It's insulting.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.060]   He's perfect and he's beautiful and he sacrificed for you
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.400]   and he looks you in the eye and says,
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.220]   "I'm not going anywhere."
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.720]   You're loved.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.240]   You're loved.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.940]   Love sends, love sacrifices, love stays.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.940]   And let me tell you something, when you get that,
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.940]   the text says, "We love because he first loved us."
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.540]   When you understand this,
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.020]   you will enter into the world as a giver
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:49.020]   and not a taker, as a grantor and not an absorber.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.740]   You will be positioned to be in a healthy relationship
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.260]   because you have a source so you can be a source, right?
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.500]   Because the beloved love, love embraced,
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.700]   becomes love extended.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.060]   Last story.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.100]   When I was living in Dallas,
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.260]   I remember I had a friend come up to me after church
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.180]   and she said, "Hey, we got some extra tickets
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.940]   "to a NASCAR race, do you wanna go?"
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.500]   I'd never been to NASCAR, didn't care about NASCAR,
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.120]   but wanted to experience the social aspect of NASCAR.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.620]   I'd never seen so many airbrushed t-shirts in my life.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.820]   And I was like, "Sure."
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.420]   So it was her and her boyfriend and two of us buddies
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.020]   jumped in the car and we drove to NASCAR.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.660]   And on the way there, the four of us are on the way there
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:34.980]   and we said, "How many tickets do we have?"
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.780]   And she said something like 200, something crazy.
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.620]   And we were like, "What?"
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.280]   And she was like, "Yeah, it was like a corporate event
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.660]   "that fell through and they just gave me all the tickets.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.780]   "Last minute, I got 'em all."
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.440]   And as soon as she said that, we were like,
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.100]   "We're gonna sell 'em.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:51.060]   "We're gonna make so much money off these NASCAR people!"
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.540]   And we were all excited about it.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.440]   And then she was like, "What?
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.820]   "No."
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.420]   She was like, "These tickets were freely given to us
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.780]   "and thus we must freely give."
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.740]   And we were like, "How?"
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.900]   'Cause it sounded like Bible-y, you know?
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.740]   And we were like.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.920]   So we show up and there's like this line
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.940]   off into the distance.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.800]   You can't see the end of very stressed out people
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.960]   trying to get into NASCAR.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.260]   And there's no guarantee they're gonna make it.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.360]   And as they're waiting in line to get tickets,
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.240]   I remember she just kind of sauntered up
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.240]   to someone in the middle of the line.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.960]   And she was like, "How many people you got?"
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.720]   And they were like, "Four."
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.440]   She's like, "There you go, thank you."
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.440]   And you could tell they didn't believe.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.480]   They're looking at her like, "What is this?
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.720]   "Some kind of like coupon?
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.700]   "What is this, stupid?"
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.980]   Like they just really blew her off.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.460]   You're a fake, you know?
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.740]   But they had nothing but time.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.680]   They're waiting in this line.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.140]   So they gave like a ticket to their kid.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.500]   It was like, "I don't know, just go check it out."
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.740]   And I remember their kid walks up to the gate
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.500]   and the gate person just scans the ticket
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.340]   and lets the kid in.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.780]   And the kid's like, "I made it, I made it."
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.500]   You know, and they go off into NASCAR.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.100]   And this family's like, "What?"
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.540]   You're like, "Can't believe it."
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:05.480]   And they're looking at her like,
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.460]   "How could you, why could you, how is this?"
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.760]   And they're all going in like crying like,
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.600]   "We love you."
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.780]   And off they go in.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.060]   And then this little buzz breaks out among the crowd.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.300]   And we would just walk among them.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.800]   We were just like, "How many do you got?"
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.380]   And it was crazy 'cause no one came up to us
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.380]   and was like, "Give me tickets."
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.900]   But they all like started to get near us.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.760]   They're like, "Hey guys, first time in NASCAR?
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.780]   "I love it, got my Baylor and heart on."
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.340]   And they would just talk to us.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.940]   And we just handed out tickets.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.060]   It became like the coolest thing ever, right?
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.660]   And we did that for I don't know how long
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.860]   'til we ran out of tickets.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.800]   And then we went in 'cause we had our tickets.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.280]   So we went in and we just thought like
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.120]   we had let all those people in.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.020]   Oh, that was kind of fun.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.000]   We went in and we didn't think,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.960]   oh, it's a block of tickets.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.720]   So we walk in, turn the corner and they're all like,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.560]   "Hey!"
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.380]   We're like, "Hey!"
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.200]   Like, "We're getting this party at NASCAR."
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.220]   And you go, "What does that have to do with anything?"
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:03.820]   How could we be so generous?
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.540]   How could we be so generous to people we don't even know?
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.900]   Because we had tickets.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:13.740]   We were fine.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.760]   So we could give tickets.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.620]   We had a source.
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.820]   So we could be a source.
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.140]   And that's what I want for you.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.980]   The heavens smile on you if you're in Christ.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.700]   And when you understand that tonight,
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.460]   your failure doesn't define you.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.240]   Your shame doesn't define you.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.220]   The thing you did again last night
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.020]   doesn't define you if you're in Christ.
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:38.860]   You're loved.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:43.980]   I don't care what your mommy or daddy said or didn't say.
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.360]   If you're in Christ, you're loved.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.060]   And when you fix your eyes
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.360]   on the sacrifice of Jesus for you,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.700]   when you see what he did for you,
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:59.200]   when you know that love,
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.980]   love embraced becomes love extended.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.100]   It's the easiest thing and the most beautiful way to live.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.100]   Let me pray for us.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:13.460]   God, I just wanna thank you
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.260]   that the message from heaven tonight
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.560]   is not stop screwing up and maybe someday I'll smile on you.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.900]   The message from heaven tonight
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:27.840]   is not get your crap together.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.580]   The message from heaven tonight
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.780]   is even if you're a long, long way off,
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.900]   the father runs
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:44.160]   because the beloved will always chase after the loved.
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.740]   Thank you, God, that the message is
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.380]   even if we are buried in sin and shame,
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:56.180]   we have a savior who came to pay for it, absorb it,
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.060]   bury it in the grave and leave it behind.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:04.420]   Thank you that if we feel isolated and alone,
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   we have a God who says, I wanna abide with you forever.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.780]   Thank you, God, that the message of heaven
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.220]   before we do a thing is that we are loved.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:22.180]   And when we get that, when we know it and believe it,
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.660]   then we are a fearless people.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.860]   Then we are free.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:30.500]   And God, I think there's people in here
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:37.100]   that maybe they've never really understood
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.740]   that that's what's being offered.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:44.260]   And I just pray tonight they'd realize that's who Jesus is.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.180]   Not a great moral teacher, though he was that.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.660]   Not a motivational speaker.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.260]   He was the lover running for the beloved,
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.640]   the sacrifice to pay our debt.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.380]   The husband who stays.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.360]   And God, I believe there's some people in here tonight
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.760]   that maybe for the first time wanna believe that,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.880]   wanna put their faith in you,
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.880]   wanna say I wanna be a child of God.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.640]   If you're forgiving, forgive me.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.240]   If you're rescuing, rescue me.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.760]   If you're adopting, adopt me.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.920]   I want in the family.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.600]   I wanna be loved by God like that.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.540]   And I wanna ask you, if that's you,
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.520]   I don't wanna make this a real weird moment.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.020]   I'd love if everyone's eyes would just stay closed.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.600]   But if you're here tonight and you're saying,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.440]   that's me, for the first time in my life,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.080]   I wanna put my faith in Jesus.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.440]   I believe he loves me like that.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.960]   Would you be willing to put a hand up?
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.000]   I could just see you.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.960]   Okay, I see you.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.400]   Down front here, okay?
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.440]   See, there's a couple of you on the right.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.080]   Down front here, a couple folks.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.480]   It's awesome, it's awesome.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.960]   Praise God.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.800]   It's beautiful.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.980]   (congregation applauding)
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.920]   God, and I just believe there's some people in here
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.520]   that maybe they've been in church a long time.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.020]   They've been doing this thing a long time.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.360]   But when they lay in bed at night,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.960]   the voice of shame and condemnation is so loud.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.360]   And I just think tonight, God,
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.980]   that you wanna sing a different song over us,
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.140]   that we're loved.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.240]   And Lord, I believe there's some people in here
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.500]   that have struggled to believe that,
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.200]   even this week, because of what they've done.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.200]   And I wanna challenge you, if that's you,
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:30.560]   I just want you to thank him, even now.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:33.080]   Thank him for loving you in the midst of your brokenness.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.540]   Thank him for not walking out
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.280]   in the midst of what you're struggling with.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.140]   Thank him that he's never gonna leave you,
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.600]   but he commits to walk with you,
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.660]   through the fire, through the flame, through the mess,
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.280]   until you see the light of the sun again.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.640]   Thank him, even now, for being a lover
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.520]   of your soul like that.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.080]   You don't have to make him any promises
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.540]   or guarantees tonight, you just have to receive tonight,
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.120]   the inexhaustible love of God.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.580]   Father, I pray that as we believe it,
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:08.860]   as we know it, may our coworkers feel it,
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.360]   may our friends see it,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.660]   that we come in with something to offer.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.760]   Thank you, God, that that's our message.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:22.260]   Heaven smiles on its children tonight.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.860]   Thank you, God, that you love us.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:35.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
