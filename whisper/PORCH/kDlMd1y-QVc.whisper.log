[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:25.940]   Love it.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.440]   Love it.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   So intense.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.980]   Tonight, we're starting a new series.
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.000]   Like you heard a few minutes ago, called Game of Thrones.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.840]   And I'm going to start us off with kind of a story that'll
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.920]   tell us where we're going.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.080]   Anyone road trip fans out there?
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.240]   A few.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.480]   Well, I'm going to let you in on my favorite road trip
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.120]   experience.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.160]   I love road trips.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.240]   And we called this the Epic Eastern Extravaganza, which
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.680]   is super nerdy and embarrassing.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.160]   But you'll understand why we called it that.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.740]   It was with me and three of my friends.
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.360]   And in college, we had a spring break
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.400]   where we decided, hey, we're going
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.660]   to go on a road trip together.
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.960]   So me, three guys, we're going to get in the car,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.680]   and we're going to go on a road trip.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.680]   And so we get on the car.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.200]   The day comes, and we haven't planned out anything
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.320]   on where we're going to go.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.160]   And so we literally get in the car and go,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.360]   where should we go?
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.680]   And people are throwing out ideas.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.680]   And then one guy says, hey, let's go to Memphis.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.480]   That's east.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.880]   We wanted to go east.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.000]   And so we book a La Quinta in Memphis, and we take off.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.160]   And so we go to Memphis.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.040]   And he wanted to see Graceland, which
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.720]   is Elvis' home.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.200]   And he wanted to see all the different things in Memphis.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.580]   And so we walked around the town.
[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.360]   We saw Memphis, all that it had to offer.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.960]   We walked.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.040]   We were walking in Memphis.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.280]   We had the barbecue in Memphis.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.560]   We had everything that you could experience in Memphis.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   And then we realized, hey, where should we go next?
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.000]   And so we decided to keep moving east.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.600]   And one friend said, hey, I've got friends in Knoxville.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.760]   Let's go to Knoxville.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.240]   Knoxville's a couple hours east, still in Tennessee.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.280]   And so on the way there, we stopped in Nashville
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.600]   and got to see all that Nashville had to offer.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.940]   Yeah, if you're from Nashville.
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.480]   And so we saw Nashville and the sights and the music industry
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480]   and everything that Tulane and just kind of the fun that
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.240]   was Nashville.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.200]   And then we continued on the journey to my friend's friends
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.280]   in Knoxville.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.000]   And we got there.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.800]   We saw the Smoky Mountains.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.880]   And we saw the University of Tennessee, the other UT.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   And we just had the whole Knoxville experience.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.640]   And so then we decided, where should we go next?
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.120]   And another guy in the car said, hey,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.900]   I think we should go to Savannah.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.360]   I don't know anyone there, but I did a fourth grade project
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.120]   on Savannah.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360]   And so let's go to Savannah.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.000]   So we've got nothing else to do.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.400]   So we might as well head that way.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.120]   So we start going off to Savannah.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.040]   And we stop in Charleston, because along the way,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.760]   another one of the guys said, hey, I
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.440]   want to see Charleston, South Carolina.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.280]   So we stopped there.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.320]   We have lunch.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.520]   We see the shore.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.800]   And then we head to Savannah.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.000]   And we didn't know anyone.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.920]   And so we decided to stay in the America's Best Value Inn,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.060]   which is a pretty tall claim for America's Best Value Inn.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.300]   And I'm not sure they lived up to the experience of best value
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.860]   in America.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.380]   It was a hotel that had seen better days.
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.540]   And one of the places that--
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.200]   it was a place that if you go in there,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.900]   you don't sleep in the bedding.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.580]   You sleep on top, because you're not sure what's happened here.
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.820]   And I don't want what's happened here.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.180]   I'm not sure if what happened at America's Best Value Inn
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.660]   stays in America's Best Value Inn and could get on me.
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.220]   So we'll sleep on top of it.
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.500]   So we stayed at Savannah.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.660]   And then we had a friend, or one of the guys in the car,
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.740]   his girlfriend, who was in Florida.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.420]   And so he said, hey, let's go there.
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.620]   And somehow he talked us to taking hundreds of miles
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.900]   out of the way to go be wingmen for him
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.500]   and a bunch of his other girlfriends, which were awesome.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.700]   And so we headed down to Florida and stayed on the beach
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.200]   with them.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.900]   And then we headed to Louisiana.
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.180]   And in the car, one of our friends,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.500]   or one of the guys with us, knew people in Baton Rouge
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.940]   and said, hey, we can stay there.
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.100]   And so we stayed and stayed in Baton Rouge.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.580]   And so that was our final stop.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.500]   And then we headed back to Houston after that.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.620]   It was eight days, 3,500 miles, 10 states.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.460]   And it was a lot of mail in one truck for a lot of miles,
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.300]   which still today the car smells from the residue that
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.060]   was left over.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.740]   But here's why I tell you that story.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.980]   In that, the journey that we took
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.700]   and the destinations that were chosen
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.540]   were all influenced and chosen and impacted
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.660]   by those of the passengers who made up the vehicle.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.500]   In every stop, in every destination,
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.380]   it was chosen and influenced by those
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.660]   who were inside of the car.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.060]   Along the journey, those who made up the journey
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.060]   helped determine and influence the decisions
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.820]   on where we would go.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.820]   Life is, in a very similar way, a journey that all of us
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.900]   are on.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.860]   And the decisions about the destinations
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.420]   of where your life is headed towards in any arena of life,
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.540]   whether it's a marital destination, where you want
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.460]   to be someday financially, whether you
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.980]   want to head towards a destination in your character,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.140]   your life is a journey that will be
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.100]   and is being shaped by the passengers or the people who
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.780]   are with you on that journey.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.300]   That those who are closest to you
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.060]   are influencing the direction and the destination,
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.780]   ultimately, of where you are going in life.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.420]   And this really isn't hard to see,
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.820]   that those who are closest to us,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.180]   just the power of association in our life,
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.060]   those who are closest to us influence us the most.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.660]   And we can see this, really, when you look back through life,
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.700]   you can really tell this.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.740]   When you look at junior high and you
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.620]   see how we all had the same haircut, the bowl cut,
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.380]   or you look at how you dress similar to your friends,
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.420]   you wore the sambas or the jingos.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.900]   No one wears jingos alone.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.020]   You only wear those for a very particular group of friends.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.540]   All of your life has been shaped.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.900]   In high school, the car you drove,
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.860]   the car you wanted to drive was shaped
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.020]   by the people and the persons who were in your life,
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.780]   the relationships.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.140]   Your college experience was likely
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.700]   shaped in a good way or in a bad way
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.420]   by the people who were with you on that journey
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.080]   through college.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.260]   Maybe your college, you had people around you
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.340]   who valued learning or who valued doing well.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.220]   And so they encouraged you on a Friday night
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.660]   or on a night before an exam to stay home and study.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.740]   And maybe you didn't do so hot your first semester
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.740]   of freshman year because you were surrounded
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.780]   by people who thought, hey, you can always retake a class.
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.220]   You can't retake a good time.
[00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.140]   Let's do this.
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.180]   And so they impacted you.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.540]   But the people that are around us,
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.420]   the relationships that are closest to us
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.700]   will make the deepest and most significant impact
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.260]   on our life.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.260]   It's just something we see.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.700]   And so here's why that's so significant.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.580]   Here's where we're going tonight as we set up
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.060]   this series on Game of Thrones.
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.660]   I think we all would say, yeah, that's true.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.740]   The people in our lives, the relationships, our friends
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.260]   are going to have a role and influence
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.020]   and determine the direction of our life.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.300]   But I'm not sure how much of a role
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.540]   and is it really that significant.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.260]   And so tonight, we're going to explore
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.940]   the life of an Old Testament king.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.180]   We're going to be in the book of First Kings,
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.500]   if you have a Bible you can fit there,
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.340]   where he shows us how crucial, how crucial this idea
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.780]   and this principle is of those who are with you in life,
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.460]   those who are closest to you in a relationship
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.260]   will make the most significant impact on your life.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.980]   Here's the way we said it.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.620]   Your friends show you a forecast of your future.
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.640]   Your friendships and my friendships, my friends,
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.900]   the people that are closest to us
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.180]   show us a forecast of our future
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.660]   because they determine the decisions and the direction
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.820]   and ultimately the destinations in our lives
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.660]   as we journey through life.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.260]   So Game of Thrones, I'm gonna set up
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.660]   just a little bit about this series
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.280]   and where we are even in the Bible.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.820]   So if you're in First Kings, you can open your Bible
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.020]   and it's in what's called the Old Testament in the Bible.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.460]   This will be kind of review for some of you
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.100]   and maybe new for some of you.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.340]   The Bible is broken into two parts primarily.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.580]   There's the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:46.420]   Yeah, good.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.660]   So the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.400]   The Old Testament is a study of the story of God's people.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.820]   It's God's nation of Israel
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.580]   and so it traces the story of God's chosen people.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.580]   Then we get to the New Testament
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.060]   and it's introduced through the church and Jesus
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.400]   and he establishes a broader group of people.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.420]   So the Old Testament, when you read it,
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.700]   you're reading the history and the story
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.580]   of the nation of Israel who God said,
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.420]   "You will be my chosen people."
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.980]   And so in the Age of Kings,
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.460]   what's interesting about the Age of Kings,
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.420]   which is where we get this,
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.460]   Game of Thrones is a study of the kings of Israel.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.580]   It wasn't always that there were kings in Israel
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.420]   and you may not have ever heard this before,
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.800]   but the nation of Israel for 500 years,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.300]   once they were established and you can read about that
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.260]   in Genesis, Exodus, in those first few books,
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.340]   once they were established,
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.940]   they had 500 years with no king.
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.260]   They were a nation ruled by law.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.620]   And what's interesting about that
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.940]   is this was something the world had never seen
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.220]   and not until the founding of this country,
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.460]   United States,
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.340]   would they see and be introduced into it again,
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.720]   that we will not be ruled by a king.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.660]   You won't have a king, you will be ruled by law
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.660]   and ultimately God will be your king.
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.820]   And so the nation of Israel, 500 years in,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.300]   decided, "Hey, I wanna have a king.
[00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.140]   "We want a king.
[00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.660]   "We're out there talking to the other nations
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.960]   "and they're like, 'Yeah, this is our king.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.800]   "'Where's your king?'
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.620]   "Well, we don't have a king."
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.540]   And so, "We want a king, give us a king."
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.700]   And so they demand that God would give them a king.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.360]   He said, "You don't want a king.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.580]   "They're gonna do what kings do.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.760]   "They're gonna take your daughters.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.780]   "They're gonna take your land.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.920]   "They're gonna take your money.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.460]   "You don't want a king.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.620]   "We wanna be like all the other nations."
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.060]   That's the point, you're not like all the other nations.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.600]   And so because they wouldn't relent,
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.580]   God said, "All right, we'll give them a king."
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.500]   And so tonight, we're gonna study the fourth king of Israel
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.700]   and a man by the name of Rehoboam.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.420]   Rehoboam, and you probably have never heard of Rehoboam,
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.460]   but you should know about his father and his grandfather.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.700]   His father was Solomon and his grandfather
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.380]   was arguably the most famous king of all, David.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.260]   And so the king lineage went like this.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.140]   God says, "Fine, give them a king."
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.280]   And he appoints Saul.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.780]   And Saul is like the Disney prince king.
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.580]   He's the guy that looks tall, he's handsome.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.460]   He's like what you see when you go to Disney World today.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.540]   He's a guy that was taller than everybody else
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.820]   and it went really, really badly for Saul.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.820]   And so God replaces him with David.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.940]   And David is a man that's called after God's own heart
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.500]   and he does really, really well
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.860]   with the exception of one event with Bathsheba.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.340]   And so after David and David of Bathsheba, David's son,
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.420]   Solomon takes over when David dies.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.660]   And Solomon starts out really, really well.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.980]   God gives him more wisdom
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.060]   than anyone who had ever lived before.
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.660]   And then in the middle of his life,
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.940]   Solomon turned away from God
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.220]   because of going after foreign women.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.460]   And so as a punishment for the disobedience
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.660]   of turning away from God,
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.580]   God said, "I'm going to rip the kingdom
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.540]   "from your son's hands.
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.080]   "And I won't do it until after you die to honor David,
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.860]   "but I'm gonna rip the kingdom from your son's hand
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.740]   "and give half of the kingdom
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.260]   "or a majority of the kingdom to Jeroboam."
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.300]   And so that's where the story picks up
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.620]   and Solomon decides, "Hey, I'm not gonna let that happen."
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.540]   So he chases down Jeroboam
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.380]   and Jeroboam flees to Egypt.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.740]   And I know these are like really exciting names.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.420]   We don't use Jeroboam and Rehoboam anymore,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.460]   probably because of the story we're about to read.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.500]   But Jeroboam flees to Egypt and eventually Solomon dies.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.760]   And that's where our story picks up
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.940]   because Rehoboam is the successor.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.860]   He's gonna be the king, the next king of Israel.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.980]   And we're gonna explore one of the most catastrophic events
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.380]   in Israel's history.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.300]   We're gonna be in 1 Kings 12.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.940]   You can open up your Bible to 1 Kings 12.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.700]   If you hit Chronicles, you've gone too far.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.960]   So back up, back up.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.040]   And as we explore the age of kings,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.260]   we're gonna start in verse one.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.640]   It'll be on the screens if you don't have a Bible.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.860]   Now, Rehoboam went to Shechem,
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.780]   which was just a city where they anointed the kings.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.340]   For all of Israel had gone there to make him king.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.540]   So Solomon dies, his son Rehoboam goes to Shechem,
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.580]   he's gonna be made king,
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.140]   and all of Israel gathers around.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.100]   It's like Lion King, with the baby being hold up.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.900]   All of Israel gathers around to make him king.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.740]   And so everyone's standing there and this is what happens.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.820]   When Jeroboam, he was the other figure,
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.860]   son of Nebat heard this, he was still in Egypt,
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.500]   for he had fled there from King Solomon.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.980]   He returned from Egypt.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.700]   So Jeroboam hears Solomon's dead, I can finally come home.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.780]   He comes back.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.380]   So they sent for Jeroboam, that's Israel,
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.980]   and he and the whole assembly of Israel
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.180]   went to Rehoboam and said,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.380]   "Your father put a heavy yoke on us."
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.020]   So all of Israel gathers together
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.980]   and Jeroboam's kind of a spokesperson,
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.340]   and they say, "Tell him this, tell Rehoboam this,
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.340]   "we want him to be king,
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.700]   "but here's what we want you to ask him to do.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.340]   "Your father put a heavy yoke on us,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.460]   "but now lighten the harsh labor
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:41.540]   "and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.300]   And in other words, Solomon,
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.340]   or I mean, Solomon, your father, Rehoboam,
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.140]   he was always having us build things,
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.300]   he was always taxing us, he built tons of palaces.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.620]   Can we just get a break?
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.860]   Can you lighten the load that your father put on us?
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.780]   Can we not have another building campaign?
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.620]   Can we not have as much in taxes taken away from us?
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.660]   Will you lighten the yoke on us?
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.260]   We want you to be king, but will you lighten up?
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.620]   And Rehoboam does something very wise, verse five.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.580]   He answered, "Go away for three days,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.300]   "and then come back to me."
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.940]   So the people went away, so they all go away.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.820]   And so Rehoboam takes time to process this decision.
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.980]   It's a very important decision,
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.780]   it's the first decision that he would make.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.380]   There's a lot at stake.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.580]   Then, verse six, he does another smart thing.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.800]   "Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.040]   "who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.660]   "How would you advise me to answer these people?"
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.020]   So again, Rehoboam does something very smart.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.020]   He's facing a decision, and he does something
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.080]   that all of us in the room need to learn to do
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.940]   when facing a decision of great importance
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.820]   or any importance in our life.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:52.140]   When making decisions, start by seeking direction
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.460]   from others.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.380]   When you and I are faced with making a decision
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.380]   about who to date, where to live, what house to buy,
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.780]   and any decision, whether you're gonna switch jobs,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.140]   Rehoboam models something that is very, very crucial
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.140]   and God speaks to constantly in the scriptures.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.680]   When you are faced with making a decision,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.220]   go and seek direction from others in your life.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.060]   That one of the key ways that God speaks to you
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.580]   and God speaks to me is through wise counselors
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.700]   or through his people in our life,
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.380]   and they have been given to us to protect us
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.540]   from making a foolish decision.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.420]   And Rehoboam does something very wise,
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.740]   and here's why it's so wise,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.240]   is because there are certain decisions
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.660]   in your life and my life where the emotion of the decision,
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.820]   hey, we're in love, or I just want this house so bad,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.500]   can blind us from doing something that is right
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.460]   or can make us or lead us to do something
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.100]   that will lead us towards a destructive path.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.980]   There are certain decisions in all of our lives
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.460]   where we just can't see it as much as we want to,
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.140]   and we look at other people's lives
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.420]   and it's much easier to see.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.740]   I mean, all of us have had friends
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.860]   that we've seen them make decisions where you go,
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.060]   what were you thinking when you decided to date him?
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.380]   He just got out of prison.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.060]   What were you thinking when you decided to buy that,
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.340]   when you decided to stay there,
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.660]   when you decided to go there,
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.540]   when you decided to quit that job?
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.860]   And we think, someone with a third grade IQ
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.340]   could have looked at this situation
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.340]   and told you this is not a good idea.
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.660]   But as easy as it is for us to see,
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.940]   in the moment for that person and for you and for me,
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.480]   there are decisions that you will face
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.140]   where you will be unable to see
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.220]   and to really act wisely on what you should do.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.460]   And so he models for us, all of us have been given by God,
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.860]   others in our lives that we are to,
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.820]   when making a decision, start by seeking a direction
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.660]   from others around us.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.780]   He learned this from his father, Solomon.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.980]   And here's why this is so interesting to me about Solomon.
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.140]   Solomon wrote the book of Proverbs.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.260]   If you have your Bible, or if you have a Bible
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.540]   and you flipped it halfway open,
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.860]   you hit somewhere near the book of Proverbs.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.420]   It's called the book of wisdom.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.620]   And Solomon wrote the book of wisdom
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.300]   and he's the wisest man who ever lived.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.340]   And one of the topics he said more about
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.620]   than almost any other topic
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.380]   was seeking counsel from others.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.740]   Think about that.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.440]   The wisest man who ever lived.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.420]   If there was one person in the history of the world
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.820]   who could go without seeking counsel from other people,
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.700]   I mean, he's wiser than everybody he talks to,
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.540]   it'd be Solomon.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.900]   And yet he says more about seeking counsel from others
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.900]   or don't make a decision without consulting other people
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.880]   who can see the situation clearly.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.320]   He says more about that topic
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.060]   than anyone else in all of scripture
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.120]   because he's the wisest man who ever lived.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.860]   So here's just a few because there's so many,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.340]   we really can't even go through all of them.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.740]   Here's a handful of them.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.020]   Proverbs 15, 22.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.420]   Plans fail.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.820]   If you have plans, here's how they're going to fail.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.780]   If you have plans to get married,
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.180]   if you have plans to buy a home,
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.960]   if you have plans to success in your job
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.140]   or wherever you are, if you have plans,
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.600]   they fail for lack of counsel.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.460]   But with many advisors, they succeed.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.740]   Proverbs 11, 14.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.100]   Where there is no guidance, a people or a nation falls.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.880]   But in an abundance of counselors, there is safety.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.140]   Proverbs 12, 15.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.700]   The way of fools seems right to them.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.740]   Like a fool will think,
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.700]   oh, this is for sure the right decision.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.500]   Oh, we should definitely date.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.940]   We should definitely get engaged.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.440]   We should definitely move in.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.200]   But the wise listen to advice.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.660]   And you are making decisions in this period of your life,
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.500]   this season and in this season of my life
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.300]   that are distinct from almost any other season
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.560]   of life that you'll face.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.700]   Like the decisions you make in your 20s and in your 30s
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.680]   will impact the direction and course of your life
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.760]   in ways that almost no other decade of your life will.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.620]   Who you're gonna marry, where you're gonna work,
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.280]   where you're gonna live, what you're gonna do for work.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.940]   And Solomon says to you, and God says to all of us,
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.340]   one of the key gifts I've given you
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.740]   is that you would seek out counsel
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.580]   from other people in your life when making decisions.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.360]   Start by seeking direction.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.120]   So here's what they respond to him
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.580]   as he asked them for direction.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.560]   Verse seven, they replied,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.680]   if today you will be a servant to these people
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.720]   and serve them and give them a favorable answer,
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.120]   they will always be your servants.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.920]   Basically, the elders tell Rehoboam,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.960]   hey, if you will be a servant to these people,
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.160]   it's going to go well for you.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.200]   Lessen the load, lighten the load.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.360]   And had Rehoboam taken this advice,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.760]   the story would have gone totally different
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.680]   from where it's about to go.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.480]   But he makes a very foolish decision.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   After making a wise decision, seeking others' input,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.980]   he makes a very foolish decision.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.920]   Verse eight, but Rehoboam rejected the advice
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.800]   the elders gave him and consulted the young men
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.080]   who had grown up with him and were serving him.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.120]   And he asked them, what is your advice?
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.800]   How should we answer these people who say to me,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.120]   lighten the yoke?
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.360]   So Rehoboam rejects their advice
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.400]   and he goes to the younger men who had grown up with him.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.120]   He goes to his high school buddies and says,
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.560]   I don't like the advice that they gave me.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.100]   What do you think that we should do?
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.200]   The young men who had grown up to him replied,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.320]   verse 10, these people have said to you,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.620]   your father put a heavy yoke on us,
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.680]   but make our yoke lighter.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.280]   Now tell them, my little finger,
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.100]   this is probably gonna be shock value,
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.200]   is thicker than your father's waist or your father's loins,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.720]   if you have another translation, which is literally the word.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.560]   In other words,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:54.800]   I am more of a man than my dad is, is what he's pointing at,
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.400]   but you should read your Bible, that's in your Bible.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.520]   My little finger is thicker than my father's package.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.660]   And so my father laid a, that's what it says,
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.640]   my father laid a heavy yoke on you
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.360]   and I will make it even heavier, he says.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.000]   Tell them that you're more of a man than your father.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.280]   My father, tell them this, my father scourged you with whips
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.820]   but I will scourge you with scorpions.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.280]   In other words, hey, don't lighten up,
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.540]   tell the people you're not lightening up,
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.960]   you're gonna make it even worse.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.380]   Tell them about the scorpions,
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.400]   you're gonna bring out scorpions out of these people
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.920]   and tell them about your dad's package,
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.400]   bring out the scorpions.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.280]   And here's why I'm making fun of that,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.080]   is anyone can see reading that this is not good advice.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.240]   I mean, it's not hard to think,
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.120]   oh my gosh, don't do it, Rehoboam,
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.320]   this is terrible advice that you're getting
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.840]   from the young men, your high school buddies,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.000]   who work for you.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.880]   Of course they want you to increase the load.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.440]   It's easy to see, unless you're Rehoboam.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.840]   And he introduces us to a quality about Rehoboam
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.000]   that I think is in all of us.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.400]   He wasn't looking for wise advice,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.160]   he was looking for affirmation.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.100]   He was looking for advice that he wanted to hear.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.540]   It's not dissimilar from situations
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.300]   where maybe you're dating a guy
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.260]   and your friends go, he's trouble,
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   I don't think you should date him.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.980]   And you just go, well, I'm gonna get new friends,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.220]   I'm just gonna move on.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:27.420]   And so Rehoboam decides and makes a decision
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.100]   in the next verse that tells us what's gonna happen.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.260]   Verse 12, three days later,
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.780]   Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.580]   as the king had said, so come back to me
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.180]   in three days, verse 13.
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.340]   The king answered the people harshly,
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.220]   rejecting the advice given him by the elders.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.580]   He followed the advice of the young men
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.020]   and said, my father made your yoke heavy,
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.300]   I will make it even heavier.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.580]   My father scourged you with whips,
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.700]   I will scourge you with scorpions.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.180]   So the king did not listen to the people,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.060]   for this turn of events was from the Lord
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.100]   to fulfill the word of the Lord
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.780]   that had been spoken through the prophet Ahijah,
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.860]   the Shilonite.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.180]   So here, this brings us to our second point,
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.540]   that the life of Rehoboam, tragically,
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.940]   as we're gonna see, illustrates that all of us,
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.260]   when it comes to choosing counsel,
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.820]   must choose counsel carefully.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.660]   Choose who you're going to listen carefully.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.980]   And this is so important, and I don't know if I can,
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.660]   in a compelling enough way, communicate this.
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.180]   You have to develop the habit of selective hearing.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.740]   We live in a world that's so loud,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.300]   and culture that is so loud,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.700]   and instructs us in so many ways that are foolish.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.940]   And they're like Rehoboam's young high school friends,
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.100]   and some of you are surrounded by people
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.780]   who are speaking foolish advice to you.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.300]   And the reason that's significant
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.980]   is because who you listen to
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.140]   will impact and influence what you do.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.340]   Who you're going to listen to
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.060]   is eventually gonna impact and influence what you do.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.980]   And to seek out from others around us
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.180]   when it comes to advice,
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.580]   not people who will just affirm the decision,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.940]   the relationship, whatever it is that we want,
[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.220]   but people who will speak wise counsel.
[00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.580]   Because if you're just looking for someone to affirm
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.940]   whatever decision you're facing,
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.700]   in whatever way you think you should go,
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.340]   they're out there, and you can find them.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.020]   And they're gonna give you foolish advice.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.780]   Like, of course, you should date him.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.900]   He's a doctor.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.220]   He doesn't speak English, but he's a doctor.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.220]   Well-loved by his people.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.140]   Or people who are gonna say,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.980]   "Hey, you guys should definitely move in together.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.580]   "It makes financial sense."
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.380]   Of course, everyone's moving in together.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.020]   You should definitely move in together.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.860]   Or people will say,
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.380]   "You should for sure lease that Mercedes."
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.740]   Or, "You should sure buy it.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.180]   "It's on sale, and you have a credit card.
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.420]   "Let's go."
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.260]   Of course you should.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.820]   And there's no shortage of advice,
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.100]   but who you listen to.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.660]   And there are so many foolish voices.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.940]   And how do you understand what a foolish voice is?
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.100]   A foolish voice or a foolish advice
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.580]   for you and for me is any instruction
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.380]   that either goes against God's word
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.860]   and goes with the crowd,
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.820]   or just goes with the crowd
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.460]   and goes against a principle in God's word.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.500]   If it goes against what God has said
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.900]   or God's people have spoken
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.580]   and goes with the crowd, the world around us,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.620]   it's pretty, you can be pretty confident,
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.940]   it is foolish advice,
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.900]   and it is going to lead you to suffer harm.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:28.620]   And there are those who will tell us
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.660]   what you want to hear,
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.300]   and it will take you to a place
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.740]   that you do not wanna end up.
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.140]   And so in learning to listen,
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.140]   selective hearing, look for wise counsel,
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.980]   not affirmation.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.940]   Here's the second thing I think
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.580]   that this illustrates for us,
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.860]   is that you and I have to choose friends really carefully.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.420]   Choose those who will be close to us really carefully,
[00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.060]   because here's what's crazy about friendship,
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.300]   the power of friendship.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.900]   Your friends and my friends
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.260]   at times have more power over us
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.860]   than our convictions.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.460]   I mean, that's the power of peer pressure.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.820]   It's like, I know I shouldn't do this,
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.620]   but everyone, oh, okay.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.380]   Your friends and my friends,
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.060]   think about that,
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.100]   have more power over your life
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.340]   and your decisions
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.780]   than your convictions,
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:15.780]   than what you believe,
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.620]   than your theology.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.260]   And they will influence and point you in a direction
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.420]   if you are not careful
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.980]   that will lead to a destination
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.180]   you don't wanna be at.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.780]   And so choose your friends carefully.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.900]   Your life has been shaped
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.180]   and my life has been shaped by this.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.100]   Almost any bad decision that you look back on
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.780]   or I look back on
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.020]   was most likely shaped
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.660]   by those who were closest to us speaking into this.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.500]   Like, think about it.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.220]   Like, the first time you got introduced to alcohol,
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.380]   it wasn't by yourself behind a 7-Eleven,
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.900]   just like, ah.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.380]   Or the first cigarette you smoked
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.740]   or the first joint you smoked
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:57.220]   was all influenced by those in your life,
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.060]   by a friend.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.420]   That's the power of friendship,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.340]   who you run with.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.180]   And tonight, some of you are running with fools
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.140]   and it's going to end badly for you
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.700]   as we're gonna see in a second.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.940]   And God who loves you
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.260]   is inviting you out of that
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.820]   and says, I don't want those who are closest to you
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.900]   to be fools.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:17.900]   Listen carefully.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.900]   Choose your friends wisely.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.420]   Your view of sexuality,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.100]   so many different stages in your life
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.700]   have been shaped by those who are closest to you
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700]   because friendship is powerful.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:35.580]   And your life is being shaped by this.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.460]   And some of you guys,
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.420]   like we hear it every week,
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.220]   like you're still in the party scene
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.980]   and you're going, yeah,
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.220]   but I'm trying to live on mission.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.140]   Jesus was out there with the partiers.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.620]   You're not Jesus.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.380]   You can't, if you walk on water,
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.480]   then you can hang out with foolish people.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.240]   And I'm not talking about living on mission.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'm saying those who are closest to you,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.880]   who will influence you the most.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.080]   God says, don't run with fools.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:09.160]   Transition, the aftermath of what happened
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.800]   based on him telling these people.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:17.720]   When all of Israel saw that the king,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.160]   verse 16, refused to listen to them,
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.360]   they answered the king.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.440]   So they see the king says,
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.680]   I'm gonna make it even heavier.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.880]   There's gonna be scorpions.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.000]   It's gonna be rough.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.560]   They say to the king,
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.660]   what share do we have in David,
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.000]   which is the line of the king?
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.600]   What part in Jesse's son?
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.280]   To your intents, Israel,
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.080]   look after your own house, David.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.740]   So the Israelites went home.
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.280]   They basically say, Rehoboam,
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.360]   you take care of you.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.760]   We're gonna take care of us and we're out of here.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.240]   But as for the Israelites
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.060]   who were living in the towns of Judah,
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.640]   Rehoboam still rolled over them.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.320]   So here's what's happening.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   Judah, Israel was made up of these 12 tribes,
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.640]   or 12 states, and only one of the states
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.480]   remained underneath the rule of Rehoboam.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.360]   He lost 90% immediately.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.240]   Like this instant,
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.560]   if you've heard of the northern kingdom of Israel
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.320]   and the southern kingdom of Judah,
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.720]   and you wonder, how did that happen?
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.000]   I thought there was one nation.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.200]   And you read the Old Testament,
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.480]   this is the moment right here, right here.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.420]   Verse 17.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.960]   Where Israel rebels because Rehoboam
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.880]   decided to listen to fools instead of heed wide counsel.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.400]   King Rehoboam is thinking,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.120]   hey, I'm gonna still take control.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.760]   These people, they think they're rebelling,
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.580]   but it's not gonna happen.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.420]   Verse 18.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.720]   King Rehoboam sent out Adaram,
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.800]   who's in charge of the forced labor,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.960]   to go get people to continue building projects.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.840]   And they literally killed the messenger.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.520]   But all Israel stoned him to death.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   King Rehoboam, however, managed to escape
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.760]   and get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.920]   So verse 19.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.960]   Israel has been in rebellion
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.600]   against the house of David to this day,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.440]   that the kingdom divided.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.100]   Jeroboam was made king of the north,
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.440]   and it would never be the same.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.980]   All because of a decision,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.800]   influenced and directed by fools.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.560]   Which brings us to our third point.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.560]   Direction from fools will bring, not maybe, disaster.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.300]   If you are listening,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.600]   and you are following instruction of,
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.560]   hey, yeah, but they're my buddies, fools,
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.500]   it will bring disaster into your life.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:42.360]   That as it's been said, if you show me your friends,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.480]   I will show you your future.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.760]   Your future in every arena of life
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.460]   is right now being shaped and will be shaped
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.820]   by the relationships that you keep.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.920]   Your friends forecast the future that you hold.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:07.080]   Ironically, again, is Solomon, Rehoboam's father,
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.120]   had he just listened to his dad,
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.280]   who wrote the book of Proverbs for his son,
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.800]   speaks about this very idea.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.280]   Here's what he says in Proverbs 13, 20,
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.320]   where he says this,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.560]   "Whoever walks or lives with the wise,"
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.040]   the word walks, same as lives,
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.080]   "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise."
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.120]   So in other words, if you live,
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.400]   and you surround yourself by wise people,
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.800]   people who live according to God's word,
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.000]   which is ancient wisdom,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.360]   that's what instructs their life,
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.360]   or just wise people.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.800]   If you walk with wise people, something happens.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.280]   It gets on you.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.920]   You become wise.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.400]   But the companion of fools,
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.640]   here's what I love about this verse.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.360]   But the companion of fools doesn't say,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.560]   we'll become a fool.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.060]   We'll suffer harm.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.160]   That if you hang out and I hang out with foolish people,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.040]   it's not just, hey, you're gonna be a fool.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.000]   You will suffer for it.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.640]   And I have friends today that are not alive
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.840]   because they did not heed this principle and this truth.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.440]   And you may have friends that have made financial decisions,
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.200]   maybe are facing criminal charges
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.960]   because they hung out with fools and it cost them.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.760]   And if you surround yourself,
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.660]   but they're my longtime friends and they are fools,
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.240]   it's going to cost you.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.800]   And I think the challenge in this subject of like,
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.360]   yeah, of course, taking instruction from fools
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.440]   is gonna lead to disaster.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.440]   I would never take direction.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.320]   Is it's hard to see if I'm listening to fools.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.120]   Like, is this person a fool?
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.800]   And so again, a fool or a non-fool,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.300]   a wise person,
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.600]   the way you can identify am I receiving wise counsel
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.680]   is does this line up with what God has spoken
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.480]   and what God has said?
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.280]   Does this line up with what God has spoken,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.640]   what God has said?
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   And if it doesn't, you need to move with real caution,
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.040]   real caution and broaden the circle
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.320]   and bring other people in on should I date her?
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.520]   Should I not date her?
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.200]   Yeah, but they said, God just wants me to be happy, right?
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.200]   You need to move with real caution.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.320]   Especially if you are dating someone right now,
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   oh my gosh, you have got to hear this
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.640]   because you are gonna make decisions that will impact
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.120]   and could potentially bring havoc
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.080]   into the rest of your life.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.320]   If you are dating someone, oh, I'm begging you,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.880]   please, before you make a decision
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.320]   about hey, we're gonna get engaged
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.560]   or hey, we're gonna get married,
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.920]   if you are the only person who is speaking into it
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.760]   that is that a good decision, you are a fool.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.640]   You are a fool, Solomon says.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.380]   And you have silenced one of the ways God speaks to us,
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.680]   which is through his people around us.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.160]   Not to control us, but to protect us.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.080]   He speaks in three ways, his spirit, his word
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.400]   and his people and if you don't have others
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.480]   speaking into that, you are a fool.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.800]   You're a fool.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.560]   And you're headed towards harm.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:25.960]   Rehoboam faced a decision and he sought wise counsel,
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.600]   which is really good and then he rejected it
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.360]   for counsel that he wanted to hear
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.840]   and it cost him everything.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.440]   And it will the same in your life and in my life
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.120]   or has a potential to because who we listen to
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.280]   will impact what we do and if you show yourself
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.040]   your friends or show me your friends
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   or Solomon says, show me your friends
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.680]   and I'll show you your future.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.840]   So here's the application I think for tonight.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.620]   There's two for all of us and then there's one really
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.040]   that I think applies just to community groups.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.960]   First one is this, you need to rid your life of fools.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.240]   You need to rid your life of fools
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.680]   and seek wise counsel in every situation.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.400]   And if you're going, I don't know if I have
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.260]   any non-foolish friends, tonight is your night.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.200]   We're gonna change that.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.100]   We wanna invite you after the service to go into this room
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.260]   or into this room right down here and go and step into
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.860]   what we call open community and be around other believers
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:23.480]   who will speak to you what is true or speak God's word
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.140]   and help inform the decisions that you're gonna make.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.560]   And if you haven't made that decision, I'm telling you,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.620]   tonight is your night and you know you need that.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.140]   You're going, yeah, but I got my buddies
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.580]   and we were going out last Friday.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:43.500]   Your life will not change in any way that is good
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.700]   and it will only be disrupted by the fools
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.260]   that you hang out with if they're fools.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.600]   I mean, can you imagine the story even for Israel
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.480]   if Rehoboam had done this?
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.240]   Hey, I'm gonna rid my life of these fools
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.800]   who clearly are a little biased
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   and I'm going to listen to wise counsel.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.520]   Number two, you need to make the decision
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.000]   about who will influence your decisions.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.180]   Make the decision about who is gonna influence my decision.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.080]   I'm gonna make the decision about who's gonna speak
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.240]   into my decisions in my life.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.280]   That means you may need to change your playmates
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.440]   in your playgrounds.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.460]   We say that all the time.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.640]   Now, one of the key ways that God grows us
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.160]   is we have to step out of what's behind us
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   and into new relationships
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.760]   and you need to change your playmates in your playgrounds.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.320]   If you don't have a group of believers around you
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.200]   who give you the collective counsel
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.760]   and wisdom of God's word, you need to step into one
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.600]   and tonight is your night.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:43.840]   I mean, even imagine if Rehoboam had done this.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:52.120]   I think what's so tragic about this
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.120]   is God wants to speak to you.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.440]   Like he wants you to know his will for your life
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.740]   and he wants me to know his will for my life.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.080]   And one of the primary ways he speaks is this
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.160]   and what's so weird is we put so much confidence
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.800]   in like random speaking things.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.340]   That yeah, I'm confident, God told me to do it
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.840]   and then you dig down every week,
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.160]   it seems like someone comes up.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.000]   Yeah, God told me I'm supposed to marry her
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.640]   and I'm like, really, tell me about that.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.680]   Yeah, well, her name's Sarah and I was opening the Bible
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.800]   and I opened it up and it was like,
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.360]   oh, Sarah married Abraham.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.520]   My name's not Abraham but I'm a big fan of the name
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.640]   and it was like, oh, marry Sarah.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.920]   Oh, I'm supposed to marry Sarah.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.980]   Does she know you?
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.280]   No, but I know that I'm supposed to marry her.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.560]   Or of like, I was sitting at this green light
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.880]   or this red light and I was like,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.200]   God, if you want me to quit my job,
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.960]   just make it turn green.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.280]   And it's like, I could be wrong.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.680]   God may speak that way but I know he speaks
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.760]   through other people in his life
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.360]   and it's like, we're quick to put lots of confidence.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.280]   There was this green light and no confidence
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.000]   and other people around us who wanna speak wise counsel
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.800]   over us and some of you have gotta step out
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.960]   of the past life and change your playmates.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.060]   And so let me be really clear.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.520]   Am I asking you to change your friends?
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.340]   No, I wouldn't.
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.640]   Yes, I'm asking you to change your friends.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.720]   That's one of the things that we say around here
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.080]   all the time is there's something that is so striking
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.560]   and it is how some people change so little
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.100]   hanging around here.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.320]   That years will go by and they change so little
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   and then there's some people who change so much
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.440]   in that same amount of time period
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.600]   and the difference is who they run with
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.420]   and who they're surrounded by.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.600]   And God is inviting you into that.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.240]   That's why we are just freaks about everyone,
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.780]   every person you've ever seen on this stage, on our staff,
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.540]   lives in community with other people speaking wisely
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.320]   into their life about the decisions they're making
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.520]   and about their life.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.700]   And then here's the third one.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.660]   This anybody can play but it's really most applicable
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.580]   for people who are in a community group
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.340]   is you need to invite those into your community group
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.680]   to speak into the decisions that you're making
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.600]   with the things that are going on.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.440]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.040]   You need to invite them into the decision making process.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.360]   For whatever reason, due to the newness of a group
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.680]   or due to the spiritual maturity
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.040]   or just due to whatever reason,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.580]   there are people in groups and they'll think,
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.400]   I don't know if you should be dating her
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.040]   but I don't know if I should tell them
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.240]   I don't wanna be judgmental
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.200]   and so let's remove that off the table
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.260]   and hopefully they'll grow to that point
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.440]   but invite others.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.560]   Here's what that looks like.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.360]   Hey, do you think that we should be dating?
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.000]   Do you think that I should buy this car?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.920]   Do you think this is a wise decision?
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.680]   Do you think that we should get engaged?
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   Do you have any red flags about us moving forward?
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.080]   Invite them into that until they feel the freedom
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.920]   to be a part of it.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.720]   Invite them in and if you're going,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.540]   yeah, but I don't know if I wanna invite them in,
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.240]   that's a problem and that probably tells you something
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.600]   about the decision that you're facing, that you're making.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:07.060]   When making decisions, start by seeking direction.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.200]   Who you listen to will impact what you do
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.160]   and if you show me your friends,
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.160]   Ray Balm says, I will show you your future.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.420]   Don't make the mistake of surrounding yourself by fools.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:29.800]   I shared a couple weeks ago about how I was,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.000]   like I didn't have the rebellious stage
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.280]   which I'm like really insecure about in my life
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.120]   'cause I feel like it's like,
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.680]   that would be such an awesome story.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.120]   I was like at VBS with all the church kids in there
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.280]   but you were out where?
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.120]   And so I like feel that and as I look back,
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.200]   I even jokingly said, I just didn't have the like strip
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.800]   clubs and we were out, you know, getting snorting stuff
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.920]   and then I jokingly said that the DARE program
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.040]   was just really effective in my life
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.920]   and here's like the truth of that.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.420]   I don't know why that's funny to people every time.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.400]   [audience laughing]
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.240]   Really not.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.640]   It's a great program.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.760]   Here's the truth is it wasn't that.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   Like I am so thankful God preserved
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.060]   and there's my heart is wicked and dark
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.160]   as everybody in the rooms here.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.200]   We're all messed up, really messed up.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.880]   Thank goodness we have a savior
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.280]   but God preserved a lot of those decisions
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.720]   and a lot of those opportunities
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.320]   and a lot of the view of sexuality or alcohol
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.560]   or drugs or any of those things through relationships.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.440]   It was this principle and some of you maybe
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.360]   can relate to that, that you were spared,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.920]   that you're not like, yeah, I was snorting Coke.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.800]   You're like, no, I don't know.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.120]   I don't even know where I would get Coke
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.960]   if somebody wanted it.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.920]   I'd be like, here's a beverage.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.160]   Is this what you wanted?
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.680]   And so you can relate to that
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.000]   and what you need to know is that this is how God works
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.680]   and no matter if that wasn't a part of your past
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.080]   and for whatever reason, some of us just in God's grace,
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.920]   that was, he protected us through those.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.280]   If that wasn't a part, you can start today
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.320]   and he's inviting you to, to be protected and preserved
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.520]   and invited into God's people to protect you through that
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.560]   'cause that road trip story I shared at the beginning,
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.080]   what's funny about that story is it's like a metaphor
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.680]   for the journey of life but that was not
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.040]   the last destination that those guys
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.640]   really went with me in my life.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.320]   They were really the way or a huge way
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.400]   in which God influenced and impacted
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.720]   and took the journey of my life.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.400]   Here's some of the other destinations
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.200]   where I just looked over and it was those same guys
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   that were sitting there and I'm in Africa
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.680]   doing work in this orphanage and I look over
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.320]   and it's those same guys with me.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.680]   We're doing ministry work or we're just worshiping in church
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.560]   and I look over and it's those same guys
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:57.160]   when I'm going through a really hard breakup
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.000]   and I look over and it's those same guys
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   when I was introduced to my wife.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.480]   It was the same guys.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.960]   And then fast forward and years later I'm standing there
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:15.200]   and I'm wearing a tux and my wife comes in in a white dress
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.720]   and I look beside me and it's those same guys,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:23.320]   those same guys who really taught me how to read the Bible.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.000]   Who really are a lot of the reason I'm even in ministry
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.880]   because God preserves and protects through relationships.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.800]   And I say that at the risk that you would be like,
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.880]   yeah, you're just a good, good kid.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.120]   That's the reality is I'm not, none of us are.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.540]   But all of us can yield to this principle
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.520]   and move in a direction of a destination
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.840]   where you wanna head towards,
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.920]   whether that's in a happily married
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.520]   to someone who loves Jesus and loves you
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.440]   or whether that's financially free
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.160]   or whether it's a moral and character destination.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.240]   He invites all of us and this is the way
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.360]   that he's chosen to do it.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.500]   Because you and I will be the sum
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.380]   of the someones in our life.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:16.280]   You and I will be the sum of the someones
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.300]   that are in your life and in my life.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.840]   And he's invited us all to be a part of this principle.
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.340]   I'm gonna pray and then the band's gonna come up.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:33.080]   Father, we thank you for just how you preserve your word.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.740]   Through ray of home, we thank you that you have
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.780]   given us the gift of others in our life
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:41.620]   who can speak wise counsel.
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:46.940]   Would you protect us from seeking
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.980]   and even from making a foolish decision
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.500]   about who, what friends are gonna be the ones
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.780]   who impact our decisions because they are
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.320]   a forecast of our future.
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.460]   Thank you that you have preserved
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.420]   and just the story of the King, Ray of Oam
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.020]   and how much, it's not some children's story,
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.960]   it's a man who lost it all, but he didn't have to.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.120]   Father, would you protect us, would you surround us,
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.020]   would you stir in our hearts to move
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.820]   and just be obedient to this principle
[00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.980]   that you protect through your provision
[00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.900]   for others in relationship in our life.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.380]   Would you surround us with wise people
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.540]   and help us to get rid of the foolish ones.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.360]   We love you.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.520]   I pray for my friends in the room who don't have that.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.900]   Would you stir their hearts right now
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:36.100]   because they know that they need it to act.
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.600]   This is the day.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.180]   Amen.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.020]   Amen.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:42.860]   Amen.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.020]   (silence)
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:55.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
