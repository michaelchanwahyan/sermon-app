[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   - James is made up of 108 verses.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   54 of them are imperatives.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.480]   An imperative is a command.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.240]   (dramatic music)
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:24.160]   That Jesus was not just his half brother, he was his Lord.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.880]   - Well, hello, poor, guys, sorry about that.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.560]   I'm like still putting my things down.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.040]   Hi, friends, my name is Josh Thames,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.360]   and like you heard, I get to be part of our team
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120]   over in Fort Worth, so welcome to everybody in the room.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.920]   Welcome to all of our friends online
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280]   in Scottsdale, Arizona, Boise, Idaho,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.480]   and especially you in Fort Worth, friends.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.320]   Hey, here's what I wanna do.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.640]   I'm gonna pray for us, and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.480]   Sound good?
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.300]   Y'all bow with me.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.860]   Father, thank you for the opportunity tonight
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860]   to gather around your word,
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.520]   and thank you for the fact that it is living and active
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.440]   and that it changes hearts.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.160]   It is a sweet thing to be in a room full of people
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.280]   that want to learn about you, know more about you,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.960]   and Father, I pray that if there is anyone
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.120]   in the room tonight that doesn't know you
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.400]   as their Lord and Savior, would tonight be the night
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.040]   that you miraculously show them just like,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.280]   man, how desperately they need you
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.540]   and how great you love them?
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.280]   Father, I pray that as we jump into James,
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.440]   would you, man, get me out of the way.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.560]   Would nothing that I say that comes just from me,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.400]   Father, be heard tonight,
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.040]   but would you just speak through me?
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.000]   Father, would you clear just my head
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.080]   and all the insecurities that it's easy to have here,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.520]   Father, and may, yeah, again, your word speak through me.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.080]   It's your name we pray, amen.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.160]   Okay, friends, I'm really excited to be in the room tonight.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160]   It's been a while since I've got to be here,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.800]   and here's where I'd like to start.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.280]   I'd like to tell you guys a little bit about myself, okay?
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.100]   So a little bit about me is I grew up in the Midwest
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.940]   on a farm.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.560]   We didn't actually farm it.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.000]   We just lived on the farm, okay?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.280]   And then I was one of those kids,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.440]   I was kind of like geared towards, I don't know,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.800]   adventurous or maybe you might call reckless things.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.880]   I just loved to do things that were crazy, right?
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.480]   So I had a little like XR70 dirt bike,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.760]   and I would just jump everything, okay?
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.200]   It's kind of wired that way.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.000]   And after some time,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.320]   I was introduced to the wonderful sport of rodeo, okay?
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.040]   Specifically bull riding.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.600]   Wow, okay, thank you.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.640]   Yeah, yes, yeah, it's really amazing.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.960]   It's one of your better career choices.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.220]   And so this is what I did.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.400]   Jumped into high school rodeo, okay?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   Jumped into high school rodeo.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.600]   And then one day, one of my like high school buddies
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.680]   was like, "Bro, we should go down the road.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.820]   There's a pro rodeo."
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.160]   At this point, I'm only 17, right?
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.000]   I'm not supposed to be there.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.680]   Like, we'll just lie to them, tell them we're 18,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.520]   we'll get in.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.600]   So I was like, I'm in, I'm in.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.640]   And so we go, go to the first pro rodeo of my life.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.320]   And that night I ended up winning that thing.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.560]   So in a matter,
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.320]   if you guys don't know how bull riding works,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.120]   you like strap yourself to a really wild animal
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.220]   and then you just like make a funny face
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.480]   for as long as possible and try not to fall off, okay?
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480]   That's what you do.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.520]   And I did that twice in a row.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.280]   So 16 seconds later, and I made $8,000.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.180]   Right, that's what I thought.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.720]   I was like, I cracked the code.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.440]   I know exactly what I'm gonna do.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.380]   Like, this is gonna be awesome, you know?
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.260]   And yeah, throw those pictures back up there.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.860]   I know sometimes I no longer like look or dress
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.700]   like I rode bulls anymore.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.980]   So I really, I was trying to like show,
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.820]   I really did do this thing.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:17.640]   It's really fun.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.160]   So that, what I did is I went home to mom and dad
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.380]   and I was like, "Mom, dad, it's been great.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.220]   High school was awesome."
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.980]   Two weeks into junior year, said, "I'm out."
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.600]   I did the math.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.680]   I'm like, I make way more, you know, 16 seconds,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680]   eight grand than all of my friends who graduated college.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.520]   You know?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.920]   And so I said no to high school, bought a minivan,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.260]   turned a little miniature motor home,
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.760]   threw my pit bull named cowboy in there
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640]   and off we went, you know?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.620]   My dad, of course, had the like,
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.520]   "Doesn't the Bible say something about testing the Lord
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.400]   and isn't this kind of dangerous?"
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.840]   Like, "Ah, we'll figure it out," you know?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.480]   And so that is what I did.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.220]   And here's why, here's what happened.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.820]   In 16 seconds, my life, I was like,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.400]   "I just made so much money.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.680]   And this is like, this is seriously going to be epic.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   Like I can make all this money, I can do whatever I want.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.680]   I can be totally free."
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.960]   Here's the thing about bull riding is like,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.800]   no one's in charge of me.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.620]   I don't have a coach.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.040]   I got to go wherever I wanted to go.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.500]   And then I made $8,000 this night
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.760]   and then I did it again and I did it again.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.240]   And I truly was like, "Man, I'm going to do this."
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   And no matter what person you meet,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.280]   no matter what cowboy or how cowboy they are,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   here's the deal.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.000]   If someone wasn't paying me,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   if there wasn't money involved in riding bulls,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.980]   the only people I do are like your drunk cousins,
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.820]   like, "Bro, check this out."
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.040]   You know, like no one would actually do this.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.840]   But because of this love of and pursuit of both money
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.120]   and the significance that I found in it,
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.600]   I dove like head first.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.560]   And it really is like comical to think that like,
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.320]   I like willingly was strapping myself,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.520]   literally tying myself to 1500 pounds of wild animal
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   in the hopes that I would get a paycheck.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.480]   And so the reason I start there is because James,
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.920]   tonight is going to show us that our money talks.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.800]   You can write that down.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.400]   Our money talks.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.800]   Your money says something about you.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.000]   Most of you are thinking, "Yes, my money mostly says goodbye,"
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.080]   which I understand.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.560]   Here's why this is so important though,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.400]   is because money determines a lot, a lot in your life,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.680]   whether you have it or you don't.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.480]   It determines like where you live, what you do for fun,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.960]   like which college you went to,
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.920]   and even like what major you picked,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.880]   what clothes you wear, if you have clothes to wear.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.000]   Money is how we acquire food.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.020]   It's how we acquire shelter.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.600]   It's also how we acquire value for our skills
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.660]   and the work that we do is in exchange for money.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.160]   And here's what that means.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's like money just hits different.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.280]   Like it has a unique role in our lives.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.200]   Like it is like truly,
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.160]   like there is something like really deep down,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.320]   even all the way to survival,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.080]   like God in his kindness designed money
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.960]   to be something that we needed,
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.000]   that we couldn't be dependent.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.700]   And you see, that's what makes money so dangerous,
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.360]   is that because if you get enough of it,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.760]   because it is how you can exchange it for like,
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.200]   not only for like clothes and food,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.920]   but how you can begin to like have fun with it.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.280]   And people begin to like look at you different
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.360]   if you have a lot of it.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.960]   Money, you gain enough money,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.880]   begins to make you feel like,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.660]   maybe I don't need God.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.280]   Like maybe I can be independent.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.520]   Maybe I can be autonomous.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.640]   And so what was meant to remind us of our dependence
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.160]   and need soon becomes why we forget,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.040]   because we have a lot of it.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.520]   'Cause I'm going, I can take care of myself now.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.880]   I've got money, God, I don't need you.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.860]   You just kind of stay in that place
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.240]   and I'll just do whatever I want.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.120]   Here's what I want you to know.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.840]   This isn't a message where we're trying to get your money
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.680]   and also God doesn't want your money.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.720]   He owns it all.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.620]   He doesn't want your money to get you.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.440]   And so James is gonna dive into this this evening.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.680]   And here's the thing.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.400]   Some of you, some of you aren't just putting like
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.920]   eight seconds of your life on the line for money.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.680]   Some of you, it's like eight years or 80 years,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.200]   or maybe the entirety of your life
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.480]   all centered around the one goal of acquiring more money.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   So as we said already, we are in the book of James
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.520]   and James is really cool.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.280]   This is just for free.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.680]   James, I think is like the greatest to me.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.000]   I'm going like, hey, this is how I know Jesus is real.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.960]   Because James, this dude's brother says he was God.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.180]   And I don't know if you guys have siblings,
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.520]   but I don't know what I would have to do.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.600]   One of my siblings is here.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.920]   And what I would have to do to convince him I was God.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.760]   Right?
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.960]   And I'm going like, hey, James,
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.800]   James is like one of the greatest proofs
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.960]   that Jesus was really real.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.800]   And so James, he's the half brother of Jesus.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.160]   And at this time, as he's writing this letter,
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.840]   he's the leader of the church in Jerusalem,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.800]   really just the first church that started.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.980]   And he's writing this letter to all the Christians
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.400]   that are scattered throughout Palestine.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.240]   Okay.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.980]   And I promise you all this context matters.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.560]   And then a major theme of this book
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.440]   is that Christians are to be doers of the word,
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.880]   not just hearers.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.600]   That our faith isn't just a simply a matter of the heart,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.120]   but it is something that compels us to action
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.800]   and it changes how we live.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.080]   And it's also written in a time
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.520]   where there wasn't really a middle class.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.760]   You had rich and you had poor
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.720]   and nothing really in between.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.640]   And so this like little section, James 5,
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.140]   one through six, get your Bibles, you can turn there,
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.480]   is written to, I believe like all Christians
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.480]   or all people who are rich, not just rich Christians,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.920]   but everyone who is rich.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.320]   So if you guys are anything like me,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.600]   you're like, hey, thank goodness,
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.320]   this guy's talking about being rich.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.160]   I'm out.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.980]   Like, this is not me.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.820]   I'm not gonna listen to him.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.640]   I don't have to worry about what's coming next.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.240]   I can just enjoy the good vibes of good worship
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.560]   and then leave here.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.880]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.720]   And I really want you to do this.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.200]   And everybody listen online, I want you to do the same thing.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.840]   I want you to pull out your phone for me.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.560]   I want you to pull out your phone.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.560]   I want you to type in, in your browser, howrichami.org.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:00.240]   Howrichami.org.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.480]   And as you guys are doing that,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.600]   I want you to then type in your salary,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.860]   type in what you make and then hit calculate.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.080]   You guys are laughing 'cause you're nervous and I get it.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.720]   It was convicting.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.560]   Here's the deal.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.380]   Here's what I found out.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.140]   If you make $33,500 a year,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.720]   you are in the top 5% of the world.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.880]   I'm gonna say it again, world.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.280]   So I'm not talking like just underdeveloped places,
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.780]   but like I'm talking the whole even developed world.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.160]   You're in the top 5% of the world.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.020]   And you might be in your mind, like, I got so much debt.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.440]   I'm still like, man, I'm living off things, you know,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.280]   but here's the deal.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.800]   You might be thinking, it's still not for me.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.320]   I would bet that everyone or close to,
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.200]   maybe everyone in the room is gonna leave here tonight
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.040]   and you're gonna go home
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.960]   and there's gonna be this little like thing on the wall
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.800]   that if you're like,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.280]   I think I want it two degrees warmer, you know,
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.960]   you can hit that.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.800]   Why do I do that?
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.360]   I do that because James,
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   this little text really applies to us in the Western world.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.660]   And so tonight we are going to see how you view money,
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.800]   how you make money and how you use money reveals
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.360]   where you find your security,
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.680]   significance and satisfaction.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   Ultimately it reveals who you are living for.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.840]   So jump in with me.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.300]   It's James 5, one through six.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.520]   Says, "Come now, you rich,
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.360]   weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.560]   Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth eaten.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.280]   Your gold and silver have corroded
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.800]   and their corrosion will be evidence against you
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.580]   and will eat your flesh like fire.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.740]   You have laid up treasure in the last days.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.300]   Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields,
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.900]   which you kept back by fraud are crying out against you.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.340]   And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.860]   of the Lord of hosts.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.060]   You have lived on earth in luxury and in self-indulgence.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.400]   You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.820]   You have condemned and murdered the righteous person.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.420]   He does not resist you."
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.660]   You're gonna be like, bro, James, you hit hard, man.
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.380]   Like why you gotta be so like straightforward with this?
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.420]   But I think it's really amazing.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:11.380]   We see inside of here, there's four indictments.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.740]   There's four indictments of the rich people
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.700]   that James is talking to.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.460]   First one is this, hoarding riches,
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.520]   stealing or withholding wages,
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.980]   living in luxury and oppressing the righteous.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.480]   And overall, here's what James is talking about.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.780]   He is talking about the misuse of money
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.980]   and what misusing money says about you
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.420]   and then what it will bring you.
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:40.420]   So my first point this evening is how you view money
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.280]   says something about you.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.360]   How do you view money says something about you.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.440]   I'm just gonna read verses one through three again.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   "Come now you rich, weep and howl for the miseries
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.040]   that are coming upon you.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.800]   Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth eaten.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.640]   Your gold and silver have corroded
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.600]   and their corrosion will be evidence against you
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.520]   and will eat your flesh like fire.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.640]   You have laid up treasures in the last day."
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.840]   So what are these guys doing?
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.280]   Here's the indictment against them.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.600]   At this point, all of these rich people,
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.860]   they're taking all of their stuff
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.700]   and they're just hoarding it.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.780]   They're keeping it for themselves.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:14.720]   There's people in need.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.960]   Like I said, there was rich people
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.020]   and there was poor people.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.360]   And even the rich Christians are just going like,
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.360]   hey, no, I'm gonna keep all this to myself.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.940]   To the point that they've hoarded the riches enough
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.340]   that it is starting to go to waste.
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.000]   Like it's truly just going to waste.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.760]   Like they've decided, hey, I'm gonna keep this.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.000]   And I think there's probably a lot of reasons
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.940]   why we would hoard or why they would even hoard riches.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.760]   You know, just maybe it's just like
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.840]   plain selfishness or greed.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.720]   But the one I wanna highlight tonight
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.080]   is the fact that when you and I have a lot of riches,
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.820]   it makes us feel secure.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.680]   Makes us feel secure.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.360]   What they're looking for
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.060]   and what they're finding inside of money is their security.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.840]   And what's interesting is that James describes
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.900]   the rich people here very differently
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.820]   than I think you and I naturally would.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.340]   He's talking about that, man, they should be weeping
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.060]   and howling because of the miseries that are coming.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.300]   Like that's very different than how I would describe
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.540]   like my friend that's just driving his new Jeep Rubicon
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.380]   down to the lake house.
[00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.020]   And like, no matter what happens, like life is set for him.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:15.860]   I probably am not thinking,
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.620]   man, that just looks like a miserable life.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.580]   What's James saying?
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.620]   Like, why is he saying that?
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.860]   Why is he saying like, here's what the rich have
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.180]   and here's what they have coming.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.820]   And what he's talking about here is really the last days.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.420]   When he says, hey, you've stored up treasures
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.080]   in the last days, he's talking about when Jesus
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.300]   is going to come back and there's a judgment day.
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.360]   Where there's gonna be time where he looks at you
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.780]   and I and everyone and we will either know him
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.680]   or we will not.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.060]   And this is what James is saying.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.380]   Because if you know Jesus, the rest of eternity with him.
[00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.020]   If you don't know Jesus, you spend the rest of eternity
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.100]   in the lake of fire.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.780]   And he literally is saying, hey, their riches
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.100]   are going to be evidence against them
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.700]   and it will lick their flesh like fire.
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.120]   'Cause he's going, it will tell me how they have used
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.420]   or viewed their riches will tell me
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.260]   where their allegiance lies.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.020]   Like who it is that they really love.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.900]   And so they had found security here.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.440]   There's really two things that are happening here.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.540]   They found security one in things that don't last.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.820]   So he's just going like, hey, you like these rich people
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.420]   you're putting all of the security
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.260]   and things that just are, they're going to rot.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.080]   They're going to go away.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.860]   Like your clothes get eaten, the food will rot.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.180]   It won't ever last.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.180]   They've bought a lie.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.100]   And like, even in the life that we live now,
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.820]   like we all know that like it's temporary.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.520]   Like things don't last forever.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.540]   I brought this for you guys for you to see.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.300]   This was a really big deal to me back in the day.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.540]   I don't know if you guys know what this is.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.900]   This is a, it was on the battery dies quick now.
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.620]   It kind of turns on anyways.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.300]   This thing was a really big deal to me.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.700]   Like I saved up for this thing.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.080]   Like I was pumped about it.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.060]   Like a couple of hundred dollars.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.860]   It's the big one, 160 gigs, you know?
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.900]   Yeah, bro.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.020]   And I used to watch movies.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.220]   Hey, don't do this.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.660]   While I was driving on this little thing,
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.660]   kind of like one of these, you know?
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.060]   Anyways, this is a really big deal to me.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.660]   I mean, I spent, I like was careful with it.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.620]   I was like, didn't made sure,
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.100]   like I didn't leave anywhere someone could steal it.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.420]   I didn't like leave it out in the sun
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.940]   where it would get hot, you know?
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.500]   Do you know what it does today?
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.180]   It sits in a drawer or like,
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.060]   it's like sits in like just an extra bag that I have.
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:28.900]   Like, I don't, I don't know.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.180]   There's like an old like electronics
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.020]   and it just like sits there.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.300]   Why?
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.180]   Things on this earth don't last.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.620]   Friends, we are eternal beings
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.840]   and temporary things are never gonna satisfy you
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.100]   for the rest of eternity.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.420]   So these, these temporary things
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.860]   will never provide the security for the eternal.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.700]   And these people that James was talking to had done this.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.220]   They had put their security in things that don't last.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.980]   And the second thing is that they had a wrong view.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.880]   Their wrong view of money was evidence against them.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.220]   And as I said earlier, Jesus is coming back
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.140]   and the big, the determiner on whether or not
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.780]   you spend the rest of your life with him
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.980]   or the rest of your life or the rest of eternity,
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.580]   not your life, the rest of eternity.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.540]   And a lake of fire is whether or not you know Jesus.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.820]   And when he says it's how they have viewed their money
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.860]   is going to be evidence.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.060]   It's going to tell me whether or not they know me.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.120]   So I'm gonna say something really, really provocative here.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.060]   Listen, if your relationship with Jesus
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.920]   never gets to a place where it moves your money,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.000]   then I would maybe suggest that you maybe don't know Jesus
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.100]   like you think you do.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.340]   So what James is saying, he's telling us this,
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.840]   he goes, how you view your money will be evidence
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.620]   on whether or not you know Jesus.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.340]   Now hear me clearly, money's not bad.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.600]   It's a good thing, God designed it.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.780]   But, and God isn't out to get your money.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.880]   He doesn't want your money to get you.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.380]   And that's what James is saying.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.260]   He's going like, hey, you need to be really careful
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.120]   and you need to watch and see what these guys did
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.780]   so that you don't make the same mistakes.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.520]   And so these guys had hoard of the riches,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.540]   they were stockpiling their clothes and their metals
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.640]   and their valuables.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.560]   That's what they did.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.040]   What do we do?
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.360]   How do we do this?
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.780]   Well, the way that we stockpile this
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:31.760]   is we put our money in like stocks or Bitcoin,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.700]   bless y'all in that like Bitcoin thing.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.540]   It feels like that's like a whole like secret club
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.540]   and y'all have only one goal, tell everybody about Bitcoin.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.220]   You know, and to acquire as much as possible,
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.820]   even if others are in need.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.660]   And why?
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.400]   Because it gives us security.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.020]   Because I feel safe when that number
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.060]   of my bank account is higher,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.820]   then I feel like I'm good.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.980]   I'm taken care of.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.080]   And here's what's really the ironic thing.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.820]   This was funny, I was trying to get an $100 bill
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.660]   and they only had 50.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.480]   So here we go.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.740]   Here's what, you know,
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.940]   do you know what it says on all of our bills?
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.620]   In God we trust.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.220]   The irony friends.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.360]   No, really the irony and both like the genius,
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.900]   but like it's going, hey, in God we trust.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.860]   And we say that, but yet so many of us trust
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.620]   in how many of these we have or we don't have.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:36.200]   James would plead with you to evaluate
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.760]   and if need be change your view on money.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.240]   Matthew 6, 19 through 21 says this,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.880]   this is Jesus talking.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.840]   And he says, "Do not lay up for yourselves
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.320]   "treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.100]   "and where thieves break in and steal,
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.920]   "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.060]   "where neither moth nor rust destroys
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.460]   "and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.140]   "For where your treasure is,
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.640]   "there your heart will be also."
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.540]   So what's the solution here?
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.680]   What's the solution if you see,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   if you're just honest with yourself,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.540]   be like, I think that I look to money to be my security.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.920]   If you have trusted in Christ, you are secure.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.880]   I just wrote down a few passages here.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.520]   John 1, 12 says this, "I'm a child of God,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   "I'm God's child."
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.880]   Romans 8, 1, "I'm free forever from condemnation."
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.160]   Romans 8, 28, "I am assured that in all things
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.240]   "God will work for my good."
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.000]   Romans 8, 35, "I cannot be separated
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.040]   "from the love of Christ."
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.640]   Don't buy the lie that acquiring money
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   will give you security, because it's a lie.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.120]   That's only found in Jesus.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.560]   And so if you find in your heart,
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.480]   I think that's what I'm doing.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.480]   I think that I'm looking to money to be my security.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.680]   I would look to Jesus, tell, hey, I think it's broken.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.380]   I think my view of money is broken.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.640]   God, will you show me how I can be secure in you?
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.160]   Not just in this lifetime, but for the rest of eternity.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.800]   So it's a transition, a wrong view of money
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.340]   often leads to wrong actions for money.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.840]   A wrong view of money often leads
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.560]   to wrong actions for money.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.740]   This is verse four, "Behold, the wages of the laborers
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.000]   "who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.060]   "are crying out against you.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.080]   "And the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.880]   "of the Lord of hosts."
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.640]   My second point this evening is this,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   how you make money says something about you.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.560]   So what were these guys doing?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.480]   These guys were withholding wages from their workers
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.080]   to make, in order to make more for themselves.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.960]   Here was the goal, money was the goal,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.460]   whatever means necessary.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.760]   So that's what these guys were doing.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.200]   And I think there's a lot of reasons
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.560]   as to why they, or you and I,
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.260]   would make money for unjust reasons.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.840]   But the one I wanted to like highlight this evening
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.740]   is because we often find in money our significance.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.760]   Like I'm able to go like, I feel significant
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.200]   when I have a lot of it.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.040]   So that's what we're gonna talk about,
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.280]   it's just like how we make money
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.360]   sometimes makes us feel like we are significant.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.640]   We like having, or we like what money,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.960]   having money says about us.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   Look, here's the deal, we all know the four to four
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.280]   works just as good and as functional as the G-Wagon.
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.680]   Yeah, okay.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.240]   But why do we want the G-Wagon?
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.140]   Because it says something about us, right?
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.080]   Because when I pull up and think,
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.660]   hey, it's a status symbol, right?
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.860]   I'm going, hey, I'm driving this.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.300]   Why do I want the G-Wagon over the Explorer?
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.660]   Look, and every single one of us
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.400]   could go buy a pair of like white sneakers,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.980]   scuff them up, put a little star on them, right?
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.100]   Y'all know where I'm going.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.380]   Y'all already know where we're going.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.940]   But instead, what are we doing?
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.720]   What are we doing?
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.100]   We could buy any hoodie with a smiley face on it,
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:56.940]   but instead, what are we buying?
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.580]   We're buying Drew house hoodie, right?
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:00.720]   Why?
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.700]   Because it says something about us.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.420]   Instead of any functional leather purse,
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.540]   we buy the Birkin bag.
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.380]   Why?
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:10.340]   Because they make you feel significant.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.020]   Like when you have things,
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.660]   when you have things that money buy you,
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.900]   it's easy to begin to go like, hey, I'm significant here.
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.540]   And here's what's really broken.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.700]   Here's what this like, this grieves me.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.860]   When we have a lot of money,
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.900]   it begins not just to like, I feel significant,
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.280]   but I also begin to think
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.460]   that I am more significant than you
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:30.960]   based off of how much money I do or don't make,
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.980]   or how much money you do or don't make.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.340]   And we do this, it's like, it's crazy how naturally we do.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.180]   So if someone walks in the room
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.540]   that we know is really wealthy,
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.500]   the way that you treat them versus someone who's maybe not.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:50.100]   Here's the deal.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:50.980]   You're not alone in that.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.620]   Like in those pictures, and this is,
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.180]   I found this, I like remember this.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.320]   In those pictures that I showed you guys
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.240]   of me riding bulls, those boots that I was wearing
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.600]   were $400 and that hat I was wearing was $600.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.840]   So things that are literally gonna end up in bull crap
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.240]   were things that I paid $1,000 for.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.400]   $1,000 because there was like,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.400]   kind of like the name brand one,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.440]   like it was a special company that made it custom fit
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.560]   to my head and to my feet, you know, it's lizard skin.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.400]   That's cool.
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.920]   We all get here because we like the way
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.680]   that money makes us feel and the significance we find in it.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.100]   Now, here's what happens when we do this though,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.040]   is that now we need money just to keep up this image
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.240]   that we've built.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.640]   'Cause all those times you've just like
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.640]   swiped that credit card, you know,
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.960]   you don't own much of anything.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.320]   And really you're just a slave to payments.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.840]   And so what does this do?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.480]   This makes you and I more susceptible,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.640]   more susceptible to make money any way that you can,
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.560]   even if it hurts others in the process.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.680]   God cares about how you make money.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.620]   So if they were holding back wages from their workers,
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.500]   what do we do?
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.340]   It looks like for us,
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.820]   like running over people to make more money,
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.740]   that might look like for you,
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.860]   maybe you gossiped about a coworker in front of your boss
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.080]   so that maybe you would get the promotion.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.100]   Or maybe instead of faithfully working all eight hours,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.380]   you spend about an hour and a half on Instagram at work,
[00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.140]   but you're kind of like, hey, you know, it's all right.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.720]   Or maybe you justify leaving like a really terrible tip.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.200]   I mean, it did take them five minutes
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.800]   to get your sweet tea, you know.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   This is how we do it.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.920]   We begin to go like, no, no, I'm gonna like hold onto this.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.760]   I want more of it.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.000]   I don't wanna have to like give it away.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.160]   So even if that means I'm putting someone else like down,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.480]   or even if that means I'm hurting someone else,
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.760]   I'm willing to do so.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.560]   And James is saying that the money acquired
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.560]   in an unjust way is crying out to the Lord and he hears it.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.300]   And man, I get this temptation.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.300]   I get this.
[00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.940]   Like one of the things that I kind of do as like a side gig
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.340]   is I like sell gym equipment.
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.320]   I know that's random, but I do that.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.020]   And so there was one day I found like a Concept2 rower.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.860]   It was $600.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.380]   I'm like, yes, I'm in, bought that thing.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.340]   And then someone's like, hey, I'll pay you 9.50 for it.
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.180]   I was like, boom, done.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.140]   You come pick it up tomorrow.
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.740]   And then someone else got ahold of me and they're like,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.580]   hey, I'll pay you 1,200 for it and I'll show up tonight.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:16.740]   And I was like, I'm in bro.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.580]   I'm not kidding.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:18.400]   I was like, yeah, I'm in.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.860]   I'd committed to this person
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.260]   that I was gonna sell them this rower for $950.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.340]   And then I like sat in that.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.140]   Like my heart got, like I was, I like felt sick
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.020]   and I just had to get ahold of him and said,
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.380]   hey, I like can't do it because I'd said to someone else,
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.780]   I'd committed that I was going to sell them this rower
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:36.740]   for a different price.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.740]   And we are all tempted to do this.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.020]   Friends, how you make money says something about you.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.460]   What's the solution here?
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.300]   How do we do this?
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.820]   If we begin to go like, yes, the way that I make money
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.880]   or how much money I make begins to how I view myself
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.000]   or what I think of myself
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.840]   or even the significance that I find, here's the solution.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.840]   Treasure Christ and not worldly status or significance.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.200]   Like treasure Christ, 2 Corinthians 8, 9 says this,
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.020]   for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:10.240]   that though he was rich, yet for your sake became poor
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   so that you by his poverty might become rich.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.340]   Friends, like keep an eternal perspective.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.620]   Like just don't buy the lie.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.260]   Like really truly like there's riches found in Jesus.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.100]   He who had everything who was rich became poor
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.960]   so that you and I, if we trust in him,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.900]   we can have ultimate riches.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.060]   Like the greatest riches, the riches that last forever.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.220]   Or this time, because of Christ, I am significant.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.220]   Matthew 5, 14, I'm the light of the world.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.740]   2 Corinthians 6, 1, I'm God's fellow worker.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:48.700]   1 Corinthians 3, 16, I am God's temple in Christ.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.820]   In Christ is where you find your true significance.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:02.860]   In the transition, James moves on from how we view money,
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.980]   how we make money, and then how we use money.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.160]   Verses five and six, you have lived on earth in luxury
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.800]   and in self-indulgence.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.540]   You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.660]   You have condemned and murdered the righteous person.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.520]   He does not resist you.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.020]   The third point this evening is this,
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:27.440]   how you use money says something about you.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.720]   So what were these guys doing?
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.220]   Hey, they were living in luxury and in self-indulgence,
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.880]   which just led to murdering the righteous person.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.980]   And what James is speaking of here,
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.100]   it's not that they were walking around with swords
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.260]   and just like killing people.
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.180]   No, he's talking about like a judicial injustice
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.880]   where like, hey, they had the money to pay
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.940]   for the high-powered lawyers,
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.140]   and they can begin to oppress and take from the poor
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.020]   whatever they wanted,
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.260]   because the poor, and the poor person
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.180]   couldn't do anything about it
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.220]   'cause they couldn't pay for the lawyers.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.220]   They couldn't represent themselves.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.380]   They couldn't work the system
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.860]   like someone with a lot of money did.
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.480]   And so because he was taking their stuff
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   and their means of life, food and water and shelter,
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.640]   this is how they were murdering the poor.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.580]   They were living in luxury and using their money
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.740]   to get what they want.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.100]   There's like a really interesting,
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.260]   the like last half of five is interesting here.
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.100]   What James says, says,
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.740]   "You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter."
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.580]   Like what?
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.140]   Feels a little confusing, you know?
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.620]   What's he talking about here?
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.920]   The image that James is using is that of a cow
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.140]   that is like indulging itself and making itself fatter,
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.840]   which in turn is making it more likely
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.640]   to be the one that gets slaughtered.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.420]   Get it?
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.260]   Yeah, that's what's happening.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.180]   He's going like, hey, as they are doing this,
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.500]   you have, you've done the same thing
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.740]   in the way that you are making money,
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.960]   the way that you are using money,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.620]   all it's doing is being evidence against you.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.860]   You are just making it more and more obvious
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.660]   that when the day of judgment comes,
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.900]   whose side you're on.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.020]   You've either worshiped God or you've worshiped money.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.880]   So there are a lot of ways to use your money,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.500]   but I want to highlight the way that we use it
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.300]   to find our satisfaction.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.620]   See, there's a great difference
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.780]   between enjoying what God has given you
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.660]   and living extravagantly and selfishly.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.740]   And hear me loud and clear, friends.
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.020]   Like God wants you to enjoy life.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.460]   Like it's okay, like if you want both scoops of Rocky Road,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.640]   go for it, you know?
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.540]   Like God isn't trying to like rob you of fun,
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.820]   but there is a difference between enjoying
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.700]   what God has given you and then living in a place
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.540]   of luxury and indulgence.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.540]   And here's the thing, it's not actually your money.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.180]   Like God owns all of it.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.140]   Like we're just stewards of it.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.540]   Like God's got it to us on loan.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.620]   He's going like, "Hey, I'm entrusting this to you
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.460]   "so that you can use it."
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.280]   And then how we use it is going to like be evidence
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.500]   of where our allegiance lies.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.260]   It's God's money.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.260]   And here's the thing, luxury is interesting.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.160]   Luxury has a way of ruining character.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.540]   The proverb says that the rich man answers roughly.
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.000]   Why does the rich man answer roughly?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.340]   Because he thinks he's more important.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.740]   He's kind of like, "Hey, you're just this person
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.720]   "because I have more than you.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.660]   "I can treat you in a certain way."
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:12.140]   See, living in luxury, it like tends to make you
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:19.100]   fat and selfish and soft and entitled.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:24.260]   Here's the thing, if you match self-indulgence with wealth,
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.300]   the result is sin.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.060]   If you match self-indulgence,
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.500]   I'm sorry, if you, wow,
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.700]   if you match self-indulgence with wealth,
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:35.840]   the result is sin.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.360]   But if you match character with wealth,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.460]   you can produce much, much good.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.580]   How you use money says something about you.
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.820]   Let me just ask you this.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.940]   What'd you do when you got your stimulus check?
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.860]   Where'd the stimmy go?
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.280]   You know, where you guys like, "This is awesome.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.300]   "That debt I've been paying,
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.980]   "that debt I've been needing to pay off, here we go.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980]   "I'll put it to that."
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.220]   Or, "Hey, I know someone who's really been impacted
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.920]   "by this pandemic, I bet they really need this money."
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.480]   Or, "Did you get the new pair of Jordans
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.340]   "that you won't like kneel down and crease?"
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.440]   Like, where'd that go?
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.540]   How are you using it?
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.460]   When you think about it, it's not your money.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.960]   I just think, hear me on this.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.560]   I don't think it's very often that when we look
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.500]   at getting more money that we go,
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.720]   "Hey, this should make me be cautious.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.520]   "Like I should be aware this is a dangerous thing."
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.420]   This is what James is telling us.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.380]   Hey, it's a really dangerous thing.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.340]   Like just having more money isn't always a good thing,
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.100]   or at least you need to be aware
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.920]   of when you make more money.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   It's kind of like, we got a fireplace at my house
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.100]   and man, fire is a good thing.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.780]   It's amazing warmth, you know, like ambiance and light.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.940]   It's like a really, really good thing.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.340]   But if I just decided, you know what?
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.420]   More fire is always better.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.660]   And I was like, "Hey, I got this eight foot log.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.140]   "Come on, baby, throw that thing on."
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.340]   You know, what would happen?
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.180]   What would happen?
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.720]   Very shortly, I would no longer have a house, right?
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.040]   Right, so fire has the ability
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.340]   to both be a really amazing thing,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.220]   but then also take everything.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.400]   And money's really interesting.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.920]   I think that, man, I would just implore you.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.400]   As you think about just getting more money,
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.240]   are you aware of the danger of it?
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.280]   Are you going like, "Hey God,
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.900]   "what would you have me do with this
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.240]   "so that it doesn't begin to pull on my heart?"
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.080]   So these guys were living in luxury,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.280]   it was leading them to murder the righteous.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.320]   And what does that mean though for us?
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.200]   How does this apply to us?
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.720]   And here's just what I wrote down.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.400]   It's like, is your first thought
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.640]   of how can you use your money for your own enjoyment
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.960]   and your own fun and your own vacation?
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.800]   Or is your thought like,
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.120]   "How can I use this to provide or bless for others?"
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.620]   And here's the thing, your bank statement is a gift to you.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.720]   Like truly, it is a gift to you.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.680]   No one else can see it,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.760]   but you can go back there and go like,
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.440]   if you wanna know where your heart is at,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.320]   if you wanna know what it is, the things you're valuing,
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.080]   if you wanna know how you're using your money
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.760]   or who you're using your money on,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.080]   go look at your bank statement.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.120]   Like, is it like dinner at HG,
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.640]   you know, and then it's the Dillards and Nike,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.920]   and then that manicure, that coffee shop.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.600]   What's it saying about you?
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.640]   It really is a gift to you, think about that.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.640]   Think about like, like he's saying, it's evidence.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.920]   How you spend your money is evidence.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.720]   Look, are you looking at your bank statement going like,
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.320]   "God, how do I view my money?
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.160]   How am I making it?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.800]   How am I using it?"
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.640]   We often use money as a means to our own satisfaction,
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.980]   and it reveals where our heart is.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:38.400]   The solution to this is to run to God to be satisfied.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:43.280]   Look, friends, he's the one who made you.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.440]   Look at me for a second.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.280]   God made you on purpose and with a purpose.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.240]   He knows exactly how you work.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:51.840]   And he is the only one that can truly provide you
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.700]   satisfaction forever.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.560]   And anything other than God is a fake, it's a phony.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.840]   It will only give you satisfaction for a moment.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.600]   Don't buy the lie.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:03.780]   Don't buy it.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.880]   Run to God, Psalm 16, 11 says this,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.680]   "You make known to me the path of life.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.480]   In your presence, there is fullness of joy.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.480]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore."
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.000]   Forever, did you hear that?
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.840]   In your presence, God, in your presence alone
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.160]   is where I am fully satisfied,
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.040]   where there's pleasures forevermore.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.340]   Money's never going to do it.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:41.040]   So in review, if you view your money as your security,
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.840]   if you make money for significance,
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.680]   and if you use your money for your own satisfaction,
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.240]   here's the reality.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.860]   In the end, it will come back painfully,
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.020]   painfully empty.
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.680]   And when Jesus comes back,
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.580]   it will also be evidence on who it is that you served.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.000]   Matthew 6, 24 says this,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.420]   "No one can serve two masters,
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.520]   for either he will hate the one and love the other,
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.480]   or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.640]   You cannot serve God and money."
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:22.280]   Do y'all hear me on that?
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:23.800]   Like, you just can't do it.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.720]   Like, it's impossible if you're like,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.560]   "Yeah, I live for God,
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   but I also like live for money over here."
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.880]   You either live for one or the other,
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:32.260]   and he's just saying like how you view your money,
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.520]   how you make your money,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.720]   and how you use it is going to tell you
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.920]   who is it you're living for, who's your master.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.520]   Here's where I wanna close,
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.520]   is the Bible says that our hearts are desperately sick
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.720]   and intent on evil,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.220]   and that we are in desperate need of a savior.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.900]   Here's how this worked for me.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.840]   So for seven years of my life, I did that.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   I ran off, rode bulls, and I like made it.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.160]   I was like making the money.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.840]   I had the girlfriend, you know, people knew my name.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.020]   And then God, in his kindness,
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.120]   on a fall day, Prescott, Arizona,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.160]   instead of on top of a bull, I ended up underneath a bull.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.920]   And I took both of his hooves to my chest,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.920]   one here, one here,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.640]   collapsed both of my lungs,
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.140]   broke all but two of my ribs,
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.080]   cut my liver in half,
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.320]   and rearranged all the like major organs, okay?
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.320]   And that sent me to the ICU for the next week.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.000]   And here's what's amazing.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.840]   God, in his kindness, he broke me in one fatal swoop.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:55.720]   He broke me physically, financially, and spiritually.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.880]   All that money that I had made, guess where it went?
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.580]   Yeah, 200 grand of hospital bills.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.880]   Yeah, that's where that went.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.020]   But I began to realize something,
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.360]   I'm not big enough to be God.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.960]   Like I've made myself God.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.040]   I've made looking for significance, security,
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.880]   and satisfaction in things that aren't God,
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.280]   like I need to think about what I'm doing
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.760]   because I realized in that moment, I'm like,
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.840]   God, if you were to come back right now,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.520]   or if I'm not gonna wake up tomorrow morning,
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.940]   I know exactly where I'd go.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.640]   I was at least honest enough with myself
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.080]   and I'd been taught really well by my father.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.960]   I knew, I knew that if Jesus came back that moment,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.360]   he would look at me and say, I never knew you.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.160]   (soft music)
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.340]   Here's the deal, like you, if you're going,
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.260]   I think I might have a broken view of money.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.980]   You are unable to save yourself.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.420]   Like you just can't do it.
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.180]   Like you're unable, like if your heart is sick,
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.980]   like you in and of yourself can't do it,
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.100]   it's going to take God in your life.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.660]   And God, look at me, he already did.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.620]   He came down as a man in the form of Jesus
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.640]   who lived perfectly.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.720]   And then he died on the cross, like he forever,
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.000]   the greatest injustice ever done in all of life,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.460]   the greatest, like most ugly thing,
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.440]   also the most beautiful thing to ever happen,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.700]   God did for you and for me,
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.740]   so that he could free us of the way
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.780]   that we search for things outside of him.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:30.320]   And that someday, oh, like glorious day that it will be
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.520]   when he comes back down, that you could be someone
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.500]   that he would look at you and go,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.700]   hey, you've done my will, you're with me.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.540]   And I want that for you.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.540]   I want that for you.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.440]   I don't want you to hear I never knew you.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.280]   But friends, a major barrier to that
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.300]   is you and your relationship with money.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.140]   Pray for us.
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:55.020]   Father, thank you for who you are
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.840]   and just your kindness
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.680]   in the way that despite us, despite us, God,
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:13.260]   you moved towards us, said while we were your enemies,
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.200]   you died for us.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.680]   And I just like confess in my heart,
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.640]   it is so easy for me to start making money, my God,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.360]   for me to have false gods, for me to reject you,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.460]   to live for myself.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.560]   Father, may we be people who understand
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.860]   that there is riches forevermore.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.180]   By your side.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.580]   Thank you for this.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.500]   Group of people, everybody listening here and online,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.460]   man, Father, would you, in only ways that you can,
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.220]   would you move in the hearts that still need you
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.500]   to regenerate them, to show them that you alone,
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.040]   you alone can satisfy.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.460]   I love you a lot.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.740]   It's your name I pray, amen.
