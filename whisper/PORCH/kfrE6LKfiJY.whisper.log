[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.300]   - All right, let's go!
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.700]   2020 is here!
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.020]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.900]   Man, we could not be more excited.
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380]   So welcome everybody that is here tonight.
[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.720]   And also, let me do something as we start off 2020
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.660]   that we've never done before.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.700]   Let me welcome every Porch Live location,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.340]   whether you in Porch North, up in Frisco and Plano,
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.500]   in Fort Worth, in Fayetteville,
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.140]   outside of Philly and Southampton,
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.420]   Cincinnati Porch, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.900]   Missouri City, Sweetwater, Texas, Houston, Texas, Phoenix,
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.700]   Porch Live Midhill, North Carolina,
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.460]   Porch Nashville, Porch of the Woodlands,
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.460]   Porch El Paso, Porch Tulsa, Porch Austin,
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.940]   and Porch Boise, Idaho, for the very first night.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.340]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.080]   In case you were wondering,
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.460]   we love getting to welcome all you guys.
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.700]   We can't always do that 'cause there's a lot of 'em.
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.680]   So all that to say, welcome friends.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.260]   Tonight we are starting this series, Roaring 20s.
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.780]   We are back in the 20s, which is pretty crazy
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.960]   because, man, it has been a minute since we were here,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.700]   but we're back again.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.520]   And it's crazy to think of what actually,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.980]   just how our world has changed
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.540]   since we were in the 20s, the 1920s.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.020]   I don't know what you know about the 20s
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.620]   or how much history you're familiar with,
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.020]   but the 20s were a time where, iconically,
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.060]   images like this were really famous
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.220]   of what was known as the flappers.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.580]   Apparently this was really scandalous
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.860]   because girls at that time,
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.140]   it's crazy how much the world was changed,
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.500]   scandalous because girls wore dresses
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.220]   that came up to their knees.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.960]   And boys were not supposed to mess with girls.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.140]   Mama told you not to mess with girls
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380]   who had dresses that went to their knees.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.380]   In addition to that, there was something taking place.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.060]   I believe called, yep, next one, prohibition.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.300]   We actually outlawed alcohol for a decade,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.820]   which just led to bootlegging
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.740]   and the underground crime unit.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.340]   Additionally, Babe Ruth was on the scene.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.380]   If you remember him, iconically remembered
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.500]   because of Sandlot, great Bambino was around.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.000]   Women's right to vote happened.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.340]   There we go.
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.120]   Better late than never.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.760]   It's crazy that the country sustained,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.100]   everyone knows women are smarter than men,
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.140]   generally speaking, that you made it that many years
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.920]   without women speaking in directly.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.820]   It's a thing in and of itself.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.380]   In addition to that, Amelia Earhart, yes, queen.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.520]   This girl flew,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.860]   was the very first aviation lady to pioneer that.
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.380]   Henry Ford transformed the world
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.240]   with the Ford 4AT, Ford T model,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.380]   and 24 million cars burst onto the scene.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.020]   It was roaring because so many technological advancements
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.180]   were happening, electricity quadrupled,
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.400]   people were getting access to running water.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.060]   They had a car, the game was changing,
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.000]   and it was roaring.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.420]   In addition to that, little known fact,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.780]   there was also something called sliced bread
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.420]   that got invented in the 1920s.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.020]   And so the expression,
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.860]   it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.280]   Now you know, oh, they mean since the 1920s,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.080]   but the roaring '20s just had all types of things
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.300]   that marked that generation.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.460]   And as we look towards 2020s,
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.480]   you can't help but wonder,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.700]   what is history gonna record about the 2020s
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.540]   that's gonna be in front of us
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.580]   when people look back in a decade?
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.140]   And truth is, none of us know.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.540]   We can't know, won't know.
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.020]   We'll get to hopefully live through it
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.020]   unless Jesus comes back.
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.700]   But what you can know is what your 2020s are gonna hold,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.740]   not entirely, but largely,
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.740]   because you're gonna play a role,
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.100]   and I play a role in shaping my 2020s,
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.380]   the years 2020 to 2030.
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.180]   If we're alive, if you're alive,
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.620]   you will play a direct role
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.940]   not in controlling everything your 20s are gonna hold,
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.460]   but more than anyone else,
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.520]   you are going to shape, more than anyone alive,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.020]   what your 20s are gonna hold.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.100]   This is a decade that will define your life.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.580]   We call it the series, The Decade of Decisions,
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.820]   because this is a decade.
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.420]   It's sobering and crazy and like, oh my gosh,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.980]   as that feels that this, more than any other decade,
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.300]   will likely determine who you're gonna be,
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.820]   the direction of your life, the story you will have.
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.360]   Think about that.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.200]   Why do I say that?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.740]   You know, even secular psychologists say
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.140]   that 80% of the major decisions that we make in life
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.060]   are made by the age 35.
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.860]   Between the ages of 20 to 35, we make decisions.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.500]   75% of you will, by the age of 35, be married.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.380]   That's not a guarantee, and I hate to say it.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.180]   This section right here is the 25% that won't be married.
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.340]   Everybody else, just that was not the right,
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.340]   and that's not at all true, but point being,
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.200]   75, think about that.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.900]   That means the vast majority, other than, you know, 25%,
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.860]   and then the, more than 80 will be married by 40.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.180]   This decade is also the time where we establish careers
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.080]   or the direction of kind of your career life.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.340]   They even say that the majority
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.580]   of your lifetime wage earnings will be established
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.820]   in your 20s and early 30s.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.540]   You develop your personality,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.080]   and it changes more than any other time
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.920]   in your 20s.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.180]   There's not a single decade that is more significant
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.420]   to the direction and story of your life
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.180]   than the one that you're living in right now.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.820]   Think about that.
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.820]   And the good news is, the God who's there loves you,
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.860]   is crazy about you.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.800]   He hasn't left you to navigate it on your own
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.420]   or me to navigate it on my own,
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.460]   and he wants you to have 20s that roar
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.300]   in every way you could imagine
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.460]   or every way in your heart of hearts you want them to.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.260]   He wants more for you than you even want for yourself,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.020]   and he's given us instructions in his word
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.960]   to lead you to life in these 20s,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]   and he's invited you.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.580]   Don't run your own offense in these decades.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.920]   Don't leave it in your own hands.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.120]   Don't leave it in the hands of culture
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.080]   of the world around you.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.480]   I'm a loving father who wants to lead you
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.040]   in the direction of the life you couldn't
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.560]   hardly even dream of
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.740]   and the story that you're gonna tell someday.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.120]   And so tonight, we're gonna kick off
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.680]   what'll be the first really six or seven weeks
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.840]   in this series where we wanna cover,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.880]   here's like our goal and hope for this series,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.160]   is that in the next handful of weeks,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.560]   we wanna cover the biggest issues
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.920]   that you gotta have a death grip,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.180]   you've gotta get this issue right
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.460]   if you're gonna have 20s that roar
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.580]   in every way you want 'em to and God wants 'em to.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.740]   So we're gonna go through dating,
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.120]   we're gonna go through finances,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.020]   we're gonna go through career,
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.660]   we're gonna go through everything that we think
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.500]   as we just prayed through,
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.000]   like these are some of the biggest issues
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.620]   you've gotta get right in this season of life
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.340]   that are at the heart of really the young adult experience
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.260]   and so many decisions that you and I will be making
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.240]   over the next 10 to 15 years.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.620]   Tonight, I just wanna start us off
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.220]   and really frame up the series
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.220]   and explore decision-making in your 20s.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.860]   The Bible has, you may not realize this,
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.780]   lots and lots to say about wise decision-making.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.180]   The entire book of Proverbs is all about decision-making.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.020]   There's a passage tonight,
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.580]   we're gonna look at the Apostle Paul teaches on,
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.860]   Jesus teaches on, like how to make sure you are not a fool
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.420]   who wastes away, who brings like pain
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.900]   and messes up your life.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.540]   You only get one 20s, you only get one life
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.780]   and the God who's there loves you enough
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.660]   to give you clear instruction and me clear instruction
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.500]   on how to best use it.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.980]   We're gonna kick off by looking at decision-making
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.820]   in our 20s.
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.860]   What does it look like to make decisions
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.820]   in line with God's word and in line with producing
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.820]   a 20s, 2020 to 2030 that roars in every way we want it to.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.900]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.700]   to Galatians chapter six, Galatians chapter six
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.020]   and we will kick off and read a few verses
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.220]   and I'll break it up as we go through there.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.740]   Galatians is a book written by the apostle
[00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.340]   formerly known as Saul who became Paul,
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.060]   who spent half his life trying to stomp out Christianity,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.740]   meets Jesus and then devotes the rest of his life
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.940]   to spreading the message of Christ and the gospel
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.340]   all around the world.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.300]   He writes about one third of the New Testament
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.700]   and this is one of the letters that he wrote
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.180]   to the church in Galatia and he's laid out,
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.020]   really he spends several different chapters
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.940]   talking about the gospel and how it lives out
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.980]   the good news of Jesus dying on the cross in your place,
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.420]   how you can have new life and then he transitions
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.620]   and gives some sobering reminders
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.980]   that despite the fact that God has already made the way,
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.580]   no matter what you do, if you have trust in Christ,
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.060]   you have eternal life forever.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.460]   In a moment, by faith, you trust Jesus on the cross,
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.500]   paid for everything you've ever done
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.740]   and you trust in his death, his burial
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.820]   and his resurrection that he defeated death,
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.620]   he paid for your sin, you're a believer.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.060]   But that doesn't mean that now any way
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.540]   that you live in this life is gonna be void of consequences.
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.340]   So he says this, starting in verse seven of chapter six.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.440]   Do not be deceived, Paul says.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.820]   God cannot be mocked.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.900]   A man will reap what he sows.
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.980]   He uses an agricultural expression
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.020]   and he basically says, hey, God has put into the universe
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.140]   or into our world certain laws or certain principles
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.980]   that if you break those principles,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.500]   if you live in the opposite direction
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.240]   of what God's law teaches,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.300]   you are going to experience consequences for it.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.680]   He introduces a principle that,
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.580]   hey, you're going to reap what you sow.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.260]   Like, hey, you sow apple seeds,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.500]   you're gonna reap an apple tree.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.900]   Sow orange seeds, you're not gonna reap a banana tree.
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.220]   Whatever you put in, you're gonna end up eventually,
[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.740]   whatever you plant in the ground,
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.460]   whatever you seeds are sown into your life
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.980]   are going to produce fruit.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.820]   Those are going to be a part of your life.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.740]   So be careful what you sow 'cause God is not mocked.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.820]   He gives us, the first idea that I wanna highlight
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.720]   is just the principle of decision making.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.440]   Like, there's a principle that the decisions you make,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.860]   every time you're making a decision,
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.200]   daily, small, big, you are sowing seeds into your life
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.260]   that eventually are gonna show back up,
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.080]   that you're gonna harvest,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.200]   you're gonna produce fruit either positively or negatively.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.620]   And it's a principle, it's a principle.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.740]   What I mean and why is that important?
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.600]   Because a principle, as it's been said,
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.980]   is not something that you choose to apply.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.980]   Like, hey, if you reap and if you choose, you can sow.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.740]   No, a principle applies itself to you.
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.540]   The principle and law of gravity
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.580]   is not something you choose to apply.
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.820]   Like, if I decide, I'm not gonna apply gravity
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.520]   and I step off of this, it's gonna apply itself to me.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.000]   And so it's not a question of whether or not
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.460]   this is something you should do,
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.860]   it is something that will happen to you.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.420]   What you reap, the decisions you make today
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.220]   in your dating relationships, financial relationships,
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.780]   in your career, in your character,
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.540]   in the people you're around,
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.220]   all of those decisions are eventually
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.940]   gonna show themselves back up inside of your life.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.520]   So the question is, what are you planting?
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.500]   What are the things that you are putting into your life,
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.440]   the decisions, whether you're consciously making them or not
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.920]   that are going to direct the course of your life?
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.140]   You are building a life.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.940]   The question is whether or not you are intentional
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.460]   about the things that you're building around.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.300]   What do I mean?
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.580]   Like, I'll use an illustration.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.420]   Over the break, we went to a place called Build-A-Bear.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.860]   Anybody ever heard of Build-A-Bear?
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.560]   My four-year-old son, it was his birthday, birthday month.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.260]   We were told that if you go into Build-A-Bear,
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.860]   for whatever age you are,
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   that's the price you pay during your birthday month.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.620]   So he was turning four, he was like,
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.740]   "Oh, we're gonna get a $4 bear, we're winning.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.780]   "This is awesome."
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.160]   And we go in there and go to the store,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.460]   and my first experience with Build-A-Bear,
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.120]   so didn't know exactly what I was going into,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.400]   but it's like, "Dude, four bucks, this is such a win."
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.920]   And then we got into Build-A-Bear.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.860]   And what they don't tell you is that,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.960]   yeah, they'll give you like this empty blank bear,
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.520]   but anything else that you want to build into the bear
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.240]   is an additional price.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.700]   And it is not a cheap price.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.860]   So they're over there charging like $18
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.840]   for some shoes that a bear wears,
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.660]   and some underwear and pants and a shirt.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.180]   And I'm like trying to like get out of there like,
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.880]   "No, we'll just do the four."
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.660]   And that people look at you like,
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.700]   "What, do you not love your children?
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.540]   "Is that what this is?"
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.000]   And you're like, "All right, just give him the pants.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.900]   "Give him the pants already, we'll pay for the pants."
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.860]   And he begins to go through,
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.740]   and I let him like, we let him build whatever he wanted.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.020]   So he gets the Spider-Man stuff in there,
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.980]   and he begins to add on,
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.840]   and each thing that he added came with a cost.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.360]   And as his dad, I know that the things that he's adding,
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.060]   I'm like, "I don't know that you're gonna want that."
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.940]   Like he was like, "I want it to smell like strawberries."
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.620]   And I'm like, "Dude, that is really strong strawberry smell.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.020]   "Are you sure?
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.700]   "You're gonna be smelling that forever, forever."
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.700]   And if, man, Sandlot has got me thrown off right now.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.460]   And then it came to the music,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.300]   and they put like a thing that makes music inside of it
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.580]   for an additional $12.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.660]   And he was like, "Yeah."
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.020]   They let him go through and pick the songs,
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.500]   and he picks "12 Days of Christmas."
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.600]   And I was like, "Man, I love that.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.540]   "I don't know if you're gonna want '12 Days of Christmas'
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.460]   "for the rest of the rest, like in June.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.180]   "We're still playing '12 Days of Christmas'
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.260]   "in my house right now."
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.780]   And I knew this is, you like it now, it cost us $12.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.500]   I don't think you're gonna like it in six months,
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.100]   and it's a $50 bear.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.420]   So, but he just went through,
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.500]   and everything he added had a cost with it.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.920]   And some, as his dad, I look on and go,
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.700]   "Man, I don't know that you're gonna like that right now."
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.820]   And other things, you know,
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.420]   "I think you're probably still gonna like
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.180]   "that Spider-Man shirt in six months.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.300]   "What does that have to do with you?
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.560]   "You are building a life.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.940]   "This decade, you are deciding, and you are creating,
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.980]   "and you are becoming the spouse you're gonna be.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.660]   "Today, and the decisions that you made
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.020]   "play a role in shaping the type of husband,
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.400]   "type of father, the type of career path,
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.180]   "like the person you are becoming, you are building it.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.060]   "And every decision that you make comes with a cost."
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.620]   It's not a question of whether it's like,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.900]   "Hey, is it free or is it not?"
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.260]   Like, no, every decision that you make comes at a cost.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.580]   What do I mean?
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.240]   Like the decision that, "Hey, I'm gonna give my 20s
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.880]   "to just kind of live in for the weekend
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.940]   "and party in every Thursday,
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.040]   "essentially through Saturday night,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.880]   "and then I'll be there at church,
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.160]   "but I'm gonna live towards that and give it away
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.600]   "and basically numb my 20s away
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.200]   "because I'm so depressed with the rest of my work,
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.780]   "wreath, and life."
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.740]   It's gonna come at a cost
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.980]   of experiencing your purpose in this decade.
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.020]   You're gonna stay in a dating relationship,
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.300]   and it's gonna come at a cost.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.700]   That's something you're building into your life.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.920]   You're saying, "I'm gonna put that on my bear."
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.460]   And it's a dysfunctional dating relationship.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.340]   Some of you are in them right now.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.180]   And you're staying in that,
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.340]   and you're continuing to stay with, you know,
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.860]   Mr. Wrong or Mrs. Wrong,
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.320]   and it is gonna prevent you from getting healthy
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.940]   because there's something unhealthy about you
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.580]   that you even keep going back to them.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.500]   So you're not gonna get healthy,
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.340]   and you're not gonna end up finding someone
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.100]   that's the type of person God describes.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.740]   So while staying with them is something you want
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.620]   in your life, it's coming at a cost to you.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.540]   The flip side is true if you wanna follow God's word,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.460]   if you wanna do what he said,
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.100]   like some of you, you've made the decision that,
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.820]   "Hey, this year I wanna change my playmates
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.740]   "and my playgrounds," or, "I've been trying to do that
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.840]   "'cause I just have negative influences around me
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.000]   "and people who keep calling me,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.700]   "and I keep getting pulled down by them."
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.140]   And it's gonna come at a cost.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.700]   If you wanna build into your life,
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.040]   "I want the right people in my life.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.140]   "I want God's people in my life."
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's gonna cost you.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.800]   What do I mean?
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.320]   Like, it's gonna cost.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.680]   There's gonna be Friday nights where you say,
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.540]   "No, I'm not going to the bar again."
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.680]   Some of you are gonna say, "Hey, I want to get healthy.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.020]   "I don't wanna have just, I keep having
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.840]   "one messed up relationship after the next.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.640]   "I'm beginning to think the common denominator is me.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.160]   "I need to get healthy.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.100]   "And I think I just need to break up."
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:44.460]   And it's gonna come at the cost of breaking up.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.780]   And let's be honest, like, dude, that sucks.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.940]   But it's a decision that you'll look back on and go,
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.860]   "Man, I'm so glad, despite the cost and the pain,
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.300]   "and as hard as it was, that I decided to do
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.220]   "what God instructed me to do."
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.020]   And the flip side is also true.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.300]   That there's things that, man, it may not cost you as much
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.380]   to continue to not follow what God says in the moment.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.940]   But when you finish the end of your decade
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.940]   and all you have to show for it is a bunch of stories
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.540]   that you hardly remember 'cause you were intoxicated,
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.280]   it comes at an even greater cost in the long run.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.700]   But the point is, you're gonna reap what you sow.
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.940]   Every decision that we're making is a part of sowing seeds.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.520]   And Paul says, "Are you making sure you are planting
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.700]   "the right seeds in your life?"
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.260]   It's gonna cost you the way.
[00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.900]   Make sure that in the long run, you don't end up
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.220]   with a bear playing 12 Days of Christmas all year round.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.800]   Or with a life that you end up at 30 going,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.580]   "How did I even get here?"
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.600]   Or 35.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.160]   Paul continues.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.580]   Oh, there's another verse that is just so relevant to this
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.500]   that I'll read where the author of Proverbs highlights.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.100]   You know what the definition of a fool biblically is?
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.780]   Like over and over, the fool used in Proverbs
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.060]   is somebody who knows it's wrong
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.300]   and I'm just gonna keep doing that anyways.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.460]   Like, candidly, I'm using this
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.500]   and this is gonna sting a little bit
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.060]   'cause some of you have said this before.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.220]   A fool is someone who thinks
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.580]   they're an exception to the rule.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.900]   If you're like, "Yeah, I know.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.120]   "That's pretty much the bad thing for everybody out there
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.920]   "and I really shouldn't be with someone like this."
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.400]   Or, "I really should stop smoking 'cause it kills you,
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.940]   "but my grandma lived to be 98."
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.760]   That, from the biblical perspective,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.020]   who says, "I see danger coming, I don't care.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.440]   "I'm not gonna live in light of that."
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.160]   Biblically speaking, is a fool.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:47.700]   I don't see this relationship actually
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.460]   ever going anywhere that's healthy,
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.240]   but I just don't think I can leave.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.900]   You're a fool.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.260]   And as lovingly as I can say,
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.160]   that's just biblically the definition.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.260]   Proverbs chapter 22, verse three says,
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.560]   "The wise see danger and they take refuge,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.700]   "but the simple or the foolish keep going
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.000]   "and they suffer for it."
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.300]   A wise person sees danger coming,
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.040]   sees where this is going,
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.140]   and he begins to stop and make a change.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.300]   Some of you tonight, the God of the universe
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.760]   who loves you so much,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.960]   he has you here on a Tuesday night studying his word,
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.280]   who cares more and is more deeply invested
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.880]   and concerned with you thriving in your 20s,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.960]   having an amazing marriage, having an amazing future.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.760]   He cares way more about that than you do,
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.200]   for you than you do.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.640]   He's got you here.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.080]   And you may be in a place where you're going like,
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.700]   "I feel like I've been on the wrong track.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.020]   "Like I lost the track.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.860]   "I'm way off.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.060]   "I've been running, I've been making decisions,
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.540]   "and I found myself in a substance addiction
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.280]   "or in a really unhealthy relationship.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.020]   "I don't even know where to go.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.380]   "I feel like I'm just lost
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.260]   "and I'm totally off the course that I wanna be at.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.300]   "I don't even recognize myself anymore.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.660]   "Things I never thought I would do, I'm doing."
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.240]   If you're in that place, you need to know
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.560]   your story's not done,
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.160]   and God has created and wants you to take a path back
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.560]   towards getting on the right track.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.640]   You're not too far gone for him to take your story
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.260]   and make good out of it.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.300]   But here's what you also need to know.
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.720]   There is no overnight fix.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.800]   In other words, in that moment where we're like,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.640]   "Hey, I'm lost right now.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.560]   "I just don't know where to go.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.180]   "And I just wish, like everything's falling apart
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.800]   "and I can't believe it, and she's pregnant,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.600]   "or I can't believe the STD happened."
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.800]   Whatever the situation is, whatever your story is,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.220]   or maybe it's just, "I can't believe
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.680]   "that I've just wandered so far from him."
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.040]   There is no overnight, and I'm back.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.520]   But just like when I get lost in the car,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.440]   you get lost in the car.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.900]   Like I was in Cleveland a couple weeks ago for an event,
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.820]   and I was driving my own car,
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.240]   and I just don't know Cleveland.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.880]   So I thought I was headed the right way,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.580]   and then I realized, "I'm lost right now.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.240]   "How do I, when I'm lost, get back on track?"
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.100]   I retrace, I go back to where I was, and I get on.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.660]   There's no moment where I just blink,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.640]   and I'm back on track.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.420]   That's the same way with a Christian life.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.560]   If you've been running, you need to know
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.600]   you're not too far gone, but the path
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.000]   is not just some overnight thing.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.520]   You make a decision after decision after decision.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.520]   The way you beat a pornography addiction
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.280]   is not by just, "Man, and then one moment,
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.100]   "he just prayed over me, and it was done."
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.240]   That's generally not the story.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.140]   Generally the story is, "I've been sober one day,
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.780]   "I was sober two days, I was sober three days,
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.180]   "I've been sober four days, I've been sober five days,
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.440]   "I've got God's people around me,
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.440]   "and day by day, I am pursuing sowing seeds of purity."
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.320]   A dating relationship, whatever you have,
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.300]   if you start dating, you're like,
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.160]   "Dude, this one, I'm for sure, I've got a past,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.000]   "I've sloughed around a little bit,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.440]   "but this one, no way we're ever gonna do that."
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.080]   You need to know the way that that happens
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.480]   is by day after day pursuing purity.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.700]   It won't happen because you're like,
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.120]   "You know what, we're in this to win it,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.080]   "but I just find you so unattractive,
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.760]   "I have no temptation here."
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.040]   That's not how it works.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.420]   You know that, right?
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.880]   Generally that's the problem.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.440]   It happens one day after the next,
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.080]   that, "Hey, I'm committed to pursuing purity,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.180]   "you committed to pursuing purity, we're gonna do this,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.980]   "we're gonna fight, and we're gonna go,
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.960]   "because we're sowing seeds of where this relationship
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.320]   "is going and where our life is going."
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.560]   And the God who's there says,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.860]   "Are you planting the right seeds in the ground?"
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.960]   He then gives us two directions or fields
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.560]   so to speak that he lays out that each of us is gonna sow
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.480]   where he says this, verse eight.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.080]   "Whoever sows," which is again,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.720]   just a word for planting seeds,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.600]   "to please their flesh,
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.760]   "from the flesh will reap destruction."
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.600]   Let me stop.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.360]   This is one of my least favorite biblical words, flesh.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.040]   It's just a weird term that we don't really use
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.000]   and nobody's like, "She's just a fleshy girl."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.480]   That typically is not, it would confuse people.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.480]   Biblically, and other translations have this,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.640]   the word flesh is just a word for sinful nature.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.480]   What's the sin nature?
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.040]   So whoever sows or plants according
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.360]   to what their sinful nature thinks they should do
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.080]   is gonna reap destruction, it says.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.520]   Sin nature is the thing inside of you
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.400]   that makes sin come naturally.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.920]   It's a thing that says, "I wanna do what I want,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.080]   "when I want, with who I want, whenever I want."
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.360]   That's the sin nature.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.680]   And he says, "If you live by that,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.900]   "if you let that govern your life,
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.300]   "it's gonna lead into destruction, self-destructive self."
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.120]   But if whoever sows or plants according
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.460]   to please the spirit, sorry,
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.440]   from the spirit will reap eternal life.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.400]   That if you sow spiritual things,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.880]   which is things according to God's word,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.760]   those are the things that you plant in your life,
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.040]   that you are going to reap life.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.720]   The second thing, in addition to the principle
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.160]   of our decision-making,
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.120]   which is that you're gonna reap what you sow,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.720]   is the path of your decision-making.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.620]   Every decision is putting you on a path
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.060]   in one direction or another.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.020]   Paul says, "And if you sow according to sinful nature,
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.720]   "you are gonna grow eventually," not in a moment,
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.420]   "things that are destructive."
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.420]   Addictions, idiosyncrasies, toxic thinking,
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.940]   where you just can't get out of it.
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.360]   Anytime you begin to sow those things,
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.300]   it's gonna lead to fruit from those things.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.860]   And the same thing, which is also positive,
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.260]   if you sow according to the spirit,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.900]   there's gonna be a fruit that comes at a later time.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.340]   That he says, "Hey, you can predict
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.660]   "based on the decisions that you're making in this season."
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.380]   It's so hard to believe, 'cause it's like,
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.960]   one day, really, is it really that big of a deal?
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.240]   Paul says, "It's not just one day.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.680]   "When you take those days and you take the decisions
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.760]   "and you put 'em together,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.940]   "you can predict who you're gonna be and where you're going,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.680]   "what your life is going to look like eventually."
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.220]   It's interesting, 'cause we as a culture love
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.660]   to kinda connect the dots on where we're going
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.500]   or where we've been and who we are
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.860]   and what we hope to look like, hope to be like someday,
[00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.900]   and have this mixed relationship
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.180]   where we don't mind looking back
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.740]   and we love kinda looking forward.
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.740]   And you remember the 10-year challenge?
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.420]   Anybody participate in this?
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.380]   10-year challenge?
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.220]   No, really?
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.580]   Wow, you guys gotta get on social media.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.500]   I need to get off or something.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.980]   10-year challenge was this moment where people were like,
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.620]   "Hey, this is what I was 10 years ago."
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.840]   And so here, there's 10 years ago.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.040]   This guy was like sunburned,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.200]   leaving a Hollister shop or something.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.760]   And this, you've come a long way.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.880]   But we've all, we're,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.260]   they just looked back on, this is where we've been.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.200]   And then there was another way,
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.140]   what we did in the future,
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.720]   where everyone had this app where we took,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.080]   basically, we allowed Russia to hack all of our stuff,
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.820]   and we were like, "Make me look old here.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.640]   "I wanna see what the future,
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.600]   "if I age like fine wine, or what I'm gonna look like."
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.440]   And we put it up there.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.680]   In fact, here's the, where I was like,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.120]   I looked at this and was like,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.700]   "I gotta start using lotion or something, face cream,
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.480]   "because I look like the guy off Castaway
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.400]   "looking for Wilson, or,
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.940]   "and this is not the future that I want someday,
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.040]   "or Santa Claus."
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.600]   And, take it down.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.440]   Okay, good.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:17.520]   And in that moment, you can look,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.740]   and you're like, "Oh man, if this is true,
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.000]   "is this really the future in front of me?"
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.320]   And Paul would say, not in a picture way,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.960]   or externally what you're gonna look like,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.000]   but he would say,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.780]   "I can tell you, if I was to spend time with you,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.460]   "and be around you, and look at the direction of your life,
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.460]   "I can tell you where you're gonna be
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.220]   "in a year, in two years, in 10 years,
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.600]   "by the time 2020 ends, or the 20s end,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.640]   "I can tell you who you are becoming,
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.060]   "and where this is headed inside of your life,
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.780]   "by the decisions that you make today.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.480]   "They're a path, they're not a moment.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.200]   "Each one of them is a part of a path
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.520]   "that is taking you somewhere.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.680]   "Are you headed in the right direction?"
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.320]   Let me be just a little bit more explicit.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.760]   Are you headed in the right direction
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.040]   as it relates to your dating relationships?
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.800]   Like some of you are thinking,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.260]   like let's just be real.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.960]   There's people of us, or some of us in the room
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.340]   that are like, "Hey, you know what?
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.760]   "I'm just kind of like dating casually right now,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.720]   "it's not that big of a deal,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.920]   "they're not the perfect person,
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.300]   "but I don't have to find the perfect person,
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:21.600]   "I'm just in my 20s."
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.880]   And you're kind of going through this casual dating phase,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.120]   and you're a little dysfunctional,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.280]   but you have in the back of your mind
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.680]   that you're like, "No, but someday,
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.080]   "I'd like to party now a little bit,
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.880]   "but I'm going to end up married
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.440]   "when the right time comes, probably like 30, maybe 31,
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.920]   "and I'm gonna find the right guy who loves Jesus,
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.120]   "and we're gonna settle down,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.360]   "he's gonna look like Ryan Gosling,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.320]   "he's gonna make me breakfast,
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.160]   "come in the morning and be like,
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.520]   "'Hey babe, how was your quiet time?'"
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.440]   And you think that's coming.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.560]   And let me just be real, that's not coming.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.520]   It's not.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.600]   And what's more likely to happen
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.040]   is that you're gonna continue to dysfunctionally date
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.720]   and date and date,
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.240]   and find maybe your worth or identity
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.080]   in having a girlfriend or having a boyfriend
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.280]   or that relationship,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.160]   and then 32 is gonna come around,
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   and you're not gonna have some guy that loves Jesus
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.320]   because you don't love Jesus,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.360]   and guys who love Jesus
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.720]   are interested in girls who love Jesus,
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.640]   and girls who love Jesus
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.840]   are interested in guys who love Jesus,
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.680]   and you don't love Jesus,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.000]   and you haven't been loving Jesus.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.120]   So you're gonna end up probably making a poor decision
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.160]   by marrying mediocre Matt,
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.080]   no offense, Matt,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.200]   who is like, "He doesn't even love Christ.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.400]   "I'm just gonna press, I'm just going right now.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.120]   "He's gonna propose to you in a very unromantic way,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.040]   "won't even have a ring,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.080]   "hasn't talked to your dad,
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.240]   "but he's like, 'Hey, let's do this,'"
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.080]   and you'll be like,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.240]   "Well, I guess he's the only option I got.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.640]   "He's mediocre Matt, but that's cool,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.120]   "and I don't want him to spend my life single,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.600]   "and you're gonna marry him."
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.760]   And that's a tragedy.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.200]   And I'm saying all that with a lighthearted, playful way,
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.240]   but it's all too real,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.840]   and I've seen it too many times,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.640]   that you just kind of,
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.400]   you assume someday I'll get serious about God,
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.520]   and that day is not coming,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.920]   or someday, hey, I'll really get somebody
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.200]   who is the type of husband, or type of father,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.460]   or type of mother that I wanna be,
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.500]   and that day's not coming,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.360]   unless you become the type of person
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.200]   that type of person is gonna look for.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.760]   Others of you, like, you're gonna get this right.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.200]   Others of you, for sure, like, in the next 10 years,
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.160]   you're not gonna end up with that story.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.040]   You're gonna end up with the story
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.360]   that like you go all in with Jesus,
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.400]   you start serving at a church,
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.840]   you're gonna meet a godly guy,
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.440]   and he's gonna see in you a godly girl,
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.120]   or you're gonna meet a godly girl,
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.480]   and she's gonna see in you a godly guy,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.080]   and you guys are gonna go on a date,
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.480]   you're gonna get to spend time together,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.460]   you're gonna end up pursuing purity together,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.300]   you're gonna get married,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.120]   you'll probably have a kid by the end of 2030s,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:48.960]   or 2030.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.360]   It's true, like, that story is in this room.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.760]   It's beautiful.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.080]   And tragically, the other story
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.160]   is that some of you guys are gonna get married
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.380]   and divorced by 2030.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.160]   But you don't have to.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.880]   And the decision to do so is in your hands right now.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.140]   And as I prepared this message,
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.720]   my heart could not be more broken and pleading with you.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.400]   These are the days and years to decide who you're gonna be,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.240]   because who you're gonna be
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.400]   will define who you're gonna marry,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.360]   where you're gonna work,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.880]   and the person and the future and story you will tell
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.480]   for the rest of your life.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:26.400]   Are you writing the story that you wanna look back on?
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.560]   Others of you, as it relates to,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.880]   you know, the path that you're headed on
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.160]   as it relates to your financial scenario.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.360]   You're in debt, and you're like,
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.840]   I don't really, you know, it doesn't really matter,
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.120]   I'll deal with it someday.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.400]   And you're just adding on to it.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.480]   You're like, yeah, car payment, that's a good idea.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.120]   I've already got 50K, what's another 10K in debt?
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.000]   And you're adding on to it,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.160]   add on onto it thinking like,
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.720]   someday I'll get married, and they'll love me so much,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.200]   they'll be like, you know what, I got this.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.960]   Here's 50 grand, just take it.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.280]   And you know, it'll go away.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.680]   And that's not gonna happen.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.960]   Generally, or it's at least not a great plan to happen.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.040]   Others of you are gonna take finances,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.400]   you're gonna be like, dude, the Bible says,
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.800]   borrow a slave to the lender, it's in Proverbs.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:05.840]   And I'm gonna make the decision
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.240]   where I wanna do everything I can
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.400]   to honor God with my finances, I wanna get out of debt.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.960]   And here's the other thing that you're gonna do,
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.040]   'cause you're gonna live according to what the Bible says.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.800]   You're gonna have something that no amount of money,
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.240]   no house, no amount in your bank account
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.600]   will ever give you contentment.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.680]   Because you're gonna make the decision,
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.160]   I'm gonna live what God says,
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.240]   how God says I should as it relates to money.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.400]   Others of you in your career, like you're gonna sow,
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.120]   and it's not gonna be in the direction of faithfulness,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.400]   and your job, like I'm just telling you,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.000]   the next 10 years, here's what it's gonna look like,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.840]   and I hate to be the bearer of bad news.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.960]   You're gonna jump from one job to the next to the next,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.480]   'cause you're like, you're gonna find yourself like,
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.440]   dude, I'm just trying to be real here.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.400]   You're gonna get in a job,
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.520]   and you're gonna be there for like a year and a half,
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.520]   you're gonna be like, I just feel like
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.520]   I'm not passionate about this, no one here appreciates me,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.160]   and I feel like, honestly, I'm underpaid, let's be honest.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.080]   How much does Becky make?
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.280]   Becky doesn't feel like she's doing that much,
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.400]   and you're gonna jump out of that job,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.840]   thinking everybody else is the problem.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.240]   You're gonna get in a job for a year and a half,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.080]   and you're gonna find yourself
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.760]   thinking the exact same things,
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.440]   never dealing with the entitlement
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.200]   and the narcissism that's there,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.720]   and you're gonna jump again, going, you know what?
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.880]   I gotta find something I'm passionate about,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.040]   not realizing every job on the planet
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.200]   has days and parts of it
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.400]   where you're just not passionate about that.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.340]   And you know what, you're gonna forfeit
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.080]   getting good at your job.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.120]   So you're gonna be 30 and jumping again,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.080]   being like, I think I'm gonna explore a new career,
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.680]   and there's times that everybody transitions,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.080]   so I'm not saying this is all the way wrong,
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.880]   but if you're the person who jumps and jumps and jumps,
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.080]   you should be concerned.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:32.000]   And you will forfeit actually getting good at your job
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.720]   and forfeit forming deep, 'cause it just takes time.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.560]   Like, you know that, right?
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.640]   Like, it takes time to be good at anything.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.480]   And you're also gonna forfeit, like,
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.960]   deep relationships where you work,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.960]   having a ministry presence where you work
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.200]   because of deep relationships that are there.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.480]   Others of you are gonna make the decision
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.040]   that, hey, I'm gonna have long faithfulness
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.120]   here at this job until it is so clear
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.400]   God has called me somewhere else
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.320]   and I'm gonna go do something else.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.080]   And there's times where he does that.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.040]   But you're gonna make the decision,
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.760]   man, I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna be faithful,
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.200]   I'm gonna work hard, I'm gonna show up early,
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.320]   I'm gonna leave late, I'm gonna honor my boss,
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.920]   I'm gonna set low expectations for everyone else,
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.880]   and I'm gonna seek to serve them
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.360]   and honor the people I'm working.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.080]   And you're gonna experience life and thriving there.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.600]   Spiritually, some of you are going to just,
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.840]   like, tonight, you're like, dude, you're just,
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.480]   you're being too mean, I'm never coming back here.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.400]   So that's okay.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.440]   And you're gonna leave here,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.680]   and I hope that's not the case,
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.680]   but you're gonna leave here and,
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.480]   regardless, whatever the reason is,
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.920]   you're not gonna step back in church for a while
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.840]   or you're just gonna have kind of a church hopping,
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.320]   like, I just, every now and then, pop in, good vibes,
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.880]   gotta get a little fill, then I go back on my way.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.500]   And your faith is gonna continue to wither and suffocate.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.620]   You can't eat once a week.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.080]   Just like you can't eat once a week,
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.200]   or you shouldn't be spiritually fed once a week.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.040]   And that's what you're gonna do.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.440]   And your 20s are gonna be wasted away,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.200]   and you're spiritually not gonna grow with God.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.040]   And you know what?
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.120]   You're gonna call a friend in, like, three years
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.960]   who's here and say, I just feel really distant from God.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.200]   There's no mystery there.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.280]   You've continued to walk and walk, walk,
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.960]   distantly from God.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.840]   He still loves you, crazy about you,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.140]   welcomes you like a father anytime you return.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.500]   And others of you are gonna say,
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.960]   man, I'm gonna take this decade
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.680]   and I'm gonna make decisions that are gonna lead
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.960]   towards the path of the person that I wanna become.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.360]   It's small daily decisions,
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.640]   and I'm gonna invest and grow my relationship with God.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.120]   It's crazy how small things daily
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.200]   can be so transformative over time.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.000]   Like, do you know if you read the Bible,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.120]   10 minutes a day, if you listen to the Bible,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.940]   10 minutes a day, so whatever your commute is,
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.400]   if you take 10 minutes of that,
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.040]   and you read or you listen to the Bible,
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.420]   in a year, you will have finished reading an entire Bible.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.060]   10 minutes a day.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.240]   If you decided, you know what?
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.620]   I wanna memorize some verses this year.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.680]   If you said, I'm gonna memorize a verse a day,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.260]   by the end of the year, you would have memorized
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.080]   or could have memorized Ephesians, Philippians,
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.640]   and Colossians combined.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.680]   It's just little small deposits of faithfulness,
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   and some of you are doing it, and you're gonna do it,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.880]   and you're gonna reap an incredible harvest,
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.800]   the Apostle Paul says, of hiding God's word
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.840]   inside of your heart.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.820]   This idea of like, man, staying on the right path,
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.280]   continuing towards the right direction,
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:25.080]   small decisions, and a moment by moment,
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.160]   determine the direction and destination of my life,
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.840]   never goes away.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.960]   This past week, I was gathering with my community group,
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.340]   and I was sharing with those guys,
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.620]   hey, I just need you to pray for me and hold me accountable.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.260]   I've been having lustful thoughts about women
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.840]   who are not my wife, and I don't want those thoughts
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.560]   to lead me towards habits, to actions,
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.160]   to anything that takes me away from being the man
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   that I want, and you may be here for the first time,
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.640]   and like, did a pastor just say,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.160]   he has lustful thoughts about a woman who's not his wife?
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.660]   Yes, because I'm a human, and I hate it,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.760]   and I need guys in my life who can pray for me,
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.160]   hold me accountable, ask me about it,
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.520]   so I invite them in, because here's what I know.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.240]   I can either suffer in silence,
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.680]   continue to feed that temptation on my own,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.200]   and it's gonna take me to a path,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.840]   and I don't want to be the 40-year-old man
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.300]   who's still constantly feeding his mind
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:18.360]   with thoughts sexually of people other than his wife.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.740]   I want the last time I've ever had a thought like that
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.800]   to be behind me.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.780]   Maybe that's not possible, 'cause sin nature's a real thing,
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.160]   but I want as much as I can to make sure,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.200]   hey, I'm not allowing that thought,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.080]   and I wanna get it out in the open,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.280]   and I need you to pray for me, I need you to know about it.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.640]   This is not who I wanna be,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.000]   'cause I wanna plant the right seeds.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.640]   Are you planting the right seeds?
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:44.520]   Finally, Paul says, "Let us not become weary in doing good."
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.480]   And he switches and really backs up
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.600]   and gives a nod or implication
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.760]   of the eternal harvest that comes,
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.980]   but he says, "Don't grow weary in doing good,
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.700]   "for at the proper time, we will reap a harvest
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.760]   "if we do not give up."
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.140]   He switches and begins to talk about,
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:04.900]   hey, it's gonna be worth it.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.860]   Continue to sow the right seeds,
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.060]   to make the right decisions,
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:09.540]   and I promise you, it's gonna be worth it.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.740]   And he begins to talk about eternity,
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.180]   and he's basically saying, it's worth it
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.980]   in this life and the life to come.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.020]   It's gonna be worth it, hold onto it,
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.980]   continue to make the decisions in those moments
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.100]   where it is so difficult, and it's difficult,
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.300]   let's just be honest.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   He says, it's gonna be worth it.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.380]   Continue to sow the right seeds.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.340]   Wherever you're at today, wherever you've been,
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.500]   you can today begin to sow the right seeds in your life.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.820]   And Paul says, it is gonna be worth it.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.500]   The third idea, or third point from this text,
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.940]   the promise that doing good pays off.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.940]   The promise that doing good pays off.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.060]   I heard from another pastor this week,
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.660]   a story that was related to a study that was done
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.820]   by a group of 1,000 individuals,
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.380]   and they divided the group in two,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.620]   and they said, hey, you guys are gonna put sunscreen
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.580]   on your face every single day.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.660]   If it's sunny outside, or if it's not sunny outside,
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.380]   put sunscreen on your face every single day.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.020]   And then the other group, they were told,
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.100]   just put sunscreen on whenever you want,
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.860]   or if you're going out into the sun.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:12.580]   So group, every single day, even when it's raining outside,
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.300]   put it on your face, group, just put it on
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   when it's sunny, or whenever you want.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.140]   And over a 10-year period, they studied
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.100]   both of these groups at the end of the time,
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.860]   and they discovered a significant reduction,
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.820]   not in cancer, or in sunburn, or any of the things
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.060]   that you would, of course, in the aging of their faces.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.460]   That a significant, like a change,
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.900]   significant, above 25%, that hey,
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.460]   the group that put on sunscreen every single day
[00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.780]   significantly aged less than the group that did not.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.700]   That they were able, based on these small decisions,
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.660]   to determine, hey, what their future,
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.680]   and what they are going to look like in the future.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.300]   What does that have to do with us?
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.220]   Nothing, but the porch is beginning to sell sunscreen,
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.660]   and if you swipe up on our porch app,
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:59.060]   you can use the promo code, PORCH2020,
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.500]   and David, sunscreen, and no, that's not at all it.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:08.100]   The idea that hey, based on these small decisions,
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.800]   you can see who you're becoming.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.620]   You can see what is in your future,
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.980]   and Paul says it's worth it, just like that small decision,
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   sunscreen every day, it's worth it.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:24.300]   The decision is to study God's word, to live in community.
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.860]   To do the hard thing when it's the right thing,
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:31.460]   even if it leads to breaking off a relationship,
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.780]   getting out of a financial situation that you can't afford.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.880]   He says it's worth it.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.460]   Living according to his word, it's worth it,
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.100]   and in the end, you're gonna see it.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.900]   And living for yourself or any other thing in your 20s,
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.460]   or for just your 20s and your 30s,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.060]   is too small of a thing to live for,
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.700]   and a foolish thing to give your life for.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.940]   So not only is it worth it, because in eternity,
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.300]   you're gonna experience for all the good
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.700]   and the ways that you sow spiritual things in your life,
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.160]   you're gonna experience a reward and benefit
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.000]   for all of eternity.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.980]   Not only is it worth it for all of eternity because of that,
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.620]   but because it is too small of a thing
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.820]   to give your life to just yourself.
[00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.840]   To you making a name for yourself, or getting more money,
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.460]   or just having the love story that you want,
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.100]   or getting that rich and famous,
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.320]   or a million Instagram followers,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.120]   or whatever else you think that is worth it out there.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.920]   Those are too small of things to give your life towards.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.080]   Why do I say that?
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.360]   Think about, let me say it this way.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.800]   I was talking to my team, we were talking about the 1920s,
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.280]   and I asked, "Hey, does anyone know
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.220]   "who was president in the 1920s?"
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.880]   And it's kind of a funny question
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.820]   'cause there's three of 'em.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.540]   And not a single person knew who was president.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.800]   I'm guessing most people in this room
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.140]   don't know who was president in the 1920s.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.900]   And maybe some of us do, but think about that.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.820]   It's Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover,
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:59.820]   and Wilson at the very beginning of 'em.
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:02.020]   Think about that.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.080]   The president of the United States,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.480]   the highest office in the land,
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.300]   the greatest holding of success you could have
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.640]   in terms of worldly standards,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.180]   most people would say the leader of the free world.
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.900]   100 years from now, no one knows who they were.
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.580]   Most of you, you know nothing about Herbert Hoover.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.700]   You're like, "Is that the vacuum guy?
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.840]   "I thought it was the vacuum guy.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.180]   "He was the president?"
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.180]   No, not the vacuum guy, president.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.060]   Calvin Coolidge, most of us think that,
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.940]   isn't that a cartoon?
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.680]   I thought that was a cartoon.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.340]   You have no idea who that is.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.380]   This is the highest achievement man can make,
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.920]   and in 100 years, no one knows who they are.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.380]   No one is going to know who you are or who I am.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.300]   You living for yourself, your own kingdom
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.580]   is too small and foolish of a thing to live for.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.160]   And the God who's there, listen to me,
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.580]   has invited you in your 20s and in your 30s
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.400]   to live for something so much bigger than yourself.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.760]   This is the most unique time period of your life.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.260]   Like no other time period that you're gonna have,
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.580]   you have more time, energy, availability to serve Christ,
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:53.940]   to do something amazing.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.860]   All of the disciples, what do they have in common?
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.640]   They were all young adults.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.420]   Every major revival in our nation,
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.620]   you know what it all had in common?
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:01.980]   It was all led by young adults.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.140]   Most of the people, candidly, that you respect
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:05.300]   when you look back in history book,
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.420]   you know what they have in common?
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   They were all young adults, 20s and 30s.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.520]   Martin Luther King, yesterday,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.580]   how old was he when he died?
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.460]   35.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.220]   He spent most of the years by which you're like, "Wow."
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.420]   Forming and developing his character,
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:18.180]   and then for the few years before,
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.360]   having an incredible impact.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.280]   My point is this.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.220]   This is the time where if God's gonna use you,
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.900]   and he wants to use you, and he will use you,
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.340]   and he always historically has used young adults,
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:30.180]   where it is your chance to not give your life
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.160]   to the bar scene, to give your life to living,
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.300]   to make a million dollars.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.980]   How foolish of a thing is that?
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.520]   Where you can give your life
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.900]   to the thing that you were made for,
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.600]   the own relationship that satisfies,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.840]   to expanding and showing the world around us,
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.900]   the one that they were made for, their Savior.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.020]   And if God is gonna use you,
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.540]   and over and over and over again,
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:50.980]   it's in this unique time period,
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.780]   candidly, this age, in this limited time window,
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.860]   where God grabs the hearts of young adults,
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.660]   and he uses them to spark something.
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:05.860]   And I hate that so many of us,
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:07.500]   despite everything or anything that I'd say,
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.980]   or as much as I would try to plead for that to happen,
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.740]   it's fallen on deaf ears.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.940]   And you're gonna leave,
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:17.660]   and you're gonna continue to just be obsessed
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:19.580]   with what the world around us thinks,
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:21.820]   and living for yourself, and what a waste.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.660]   But my heart and my hope is that some of you,
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.660]   you're gonna get it, and you're gonna decide,
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.040]   I'm going all in with this, with Jesus,
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.260]   with what he invites me to.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:38.340]   And you're gonna experience, Paul says, life,
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:39.940]   in this one and the one to come.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.860]   In conclusion, the principle of decision-making
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.060]   is that you reap what you sow.
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.100]   The path that you're on is defined
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.180]   by the decisions that we make.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.740]   And there is a promise, God says, it will pay off.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:59.860]   Interestingly, the 1920s are iconic,
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.740]   because it was a time that was so exciting,
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:04.820]   and just booming, and everyone was like,
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.060]   money, money, money, and it was scandalous,
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.320]   and there was kind of a recklessness,
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.980]   like as much as I was kidding about the dress
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.380]   that they had, it was like, wow, this is so crazy.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.740]   And people were investing money like crazy.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.620]   The economy quadrupled.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.140]   People were taking out loans
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.300]   to put it into the stock market.
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.220]   Think about that.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.780]   And it just, money, money, money,
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.820]   and people had a mentality that was like,
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.020]   the music's never gonna stop, let the party continue,
[00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.560]   let the champagne roll.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.260]   And eventually, that reckless mentality
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.940]   led to some reckless decision-making
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.920]   around the stock market and finances.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.380]   And all of a sudden, that perspective that,
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:45.140]   hey, the party will never end, it's only up and up,
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.900]   all of it came crashing down.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.860]   And what followed was a Great Depression.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.020]   And so many of the people who lived through that,
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.860]   like the party, music won't ever stop,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.040]   the music stopped, and they had to go through a depression.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.580]   And you know, if you have any grandparents
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.820]   that lived through the Great Depression,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.780]   there's something that most of them have in common,
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.620]   where they're all like, very sober-minded because of it.
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.260]   Like, you're like, Grandma, look,
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.780]   can I just have one scoop of mayonnaise on the sandwich?
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:12.020]   She's like, you can have half a scoop.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.100]   Half a scoop for you.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.380]   That she's just like, I just don't know
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.620]   what's gonna happen because that crash
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.260]   and depression sobered them.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:24.380]   Some of you, tragically, tonight,
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.980]   you're listening and you're listening where you are,
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.380]   in 17 locations, or you're listening to this podcast,
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.700]   and you're, despite all of the things
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.820]   that God clearly says, you are not going to listen.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.260]   And you're gonna continue a mentality
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.240]   that I'm gonna live how I want during this phase of life,
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.480]   it's not that big of a deal, dude,
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.820]   I'll be the exception to the rule,
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.660]   and I want you to hear me, it's going to come crashing down.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.060]   And when it does, there's gonna be a depression
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.540]   of sorts that follows.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.700]   And it's gonna have implications
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.560]   for your 30s and your 40s.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.980]   And in the midst of that, you know what's true?
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.340]   God's gonna meet you there.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.340]   And that depression will be something, hopefully,
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.900]   God uses to grab your heart and bring you back to him.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.980]   Say, I've never been angry at you, I love you,
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.780]   I've always wanted life for you, and I still offer that.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.180]   But you're gonna have to sow according to my ways,
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.300]   but others of you, you're not gonna allow
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.900]   that reckless music will never stop mentality
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.220]   to shape and define your life.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   You're gonna live according to his word
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.100]   and sow the things into your life
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.900]   that are gonna lead towards the life
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.260]   that in your heart of hearts you want,
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.020]   a life that aligns with God's word.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.560]   I'll close right here.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.260]   I want you to think about something with me,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.220]   each of you individually, wherever you are.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.220]   It's 2020, how old are you?
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.460]   You don't have to say it out loud, just get the number.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.140]   In 2030, how old are you gonna be?
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:48.740]   I don't know if you're gonna be 27,
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.340]   which would be really young for you to be in here, actually,
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.140]   or 37, (audience laughing)
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:59.140]   or 32, or 38, or 39,
[00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.220]   42, whatever that number is.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.260]   It's your 42nd birthday, it's your 36th birthday.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.300]   Your friends all get together,
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.820]   and I just want you to go there with me in your mind.
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.460]   Your friends get together, you're 36, 35,
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.300]   whatever that number is, fill in the blank for you.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.300]   They all get together and they're like,
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.740]   hey, it's Lisa's party, or it's Caleb's party,
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.780]   or Chris, or whatever.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:20.260]   We're getting all together, we have the birthday party,
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.920]   they're going to Bowling Barrel, they're celebrating you,
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.940]   it's gonna be awesome, or wherever you like to party.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.820]   And you're there, and they bring out the cake
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.420]   and they got the number of candles just for your birthday,
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.260]   35.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.500]   Who do you want to be in that moment?
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.540]   Who's gonna be in that room?
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.020]   What's the type of person that you wanna be there?
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.900]   Do you still wanna be someone who continues
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.340]   to look at pornography every single day?
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.180]   Do you still wanna be someone
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.060]   who's in a dysfunctional dating relationship
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.620]   that, man, they just kind of never grew out of,
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.460]   perpetually engaged?
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.540]   Do you still wanna be someone whose life is marked by,
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.180]   I'm just so anxious all the time, I'm covered in anxiety,
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.820]   I'm taking medication constantly
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:02.320]   to cope with the anxiety around me,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.860]   I've got a drinking problem that I can't cope with?
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.980]   Do you wanna be someone who has peace?
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.580]   Maybe who's in a healthy relationship
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:16.040]   or married in that moment, not perfect.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.540]   Someone who's found that their identity
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.820]   didn't come from what other people think
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.340]   and I don't have to worry about pleasing other people,
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:26.860]   I have the approval of God, what else do I need?
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.420]   I don't know what you would fill in the blank
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.360]   and what that future version you would love to see,
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.160]   but here's what I know, or here's what I wanna ask.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.620]   How do you think you're going to get there?
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.260]   It won't happen overnight.
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.980]   In other words, the decisions that you're making,
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.100]   if you got this future version of just walking with God
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.360]   and family, that doesn't happen overnight.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.220]   It doesn't happen in a moment.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.460]   It happens moment by moment and the decisions
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.400]   and the days between now and then will define
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.340]   what and who you will be at that party.
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.820]   Are you becoming the person that you want to be
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.000]   for those moments?
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.500]   And so let me close by iterating.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.340]   How?
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:12.540]   How?
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.860]   How, God, do I become the husband?
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.340]   I'm gonna be 43.
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.580]   How do I become the dad that I wanna be at 43?
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.920]   How do I become more patient, more in love with Jesus,
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.840]   more generous with my time and my money?
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.980]   How do I become everything that I want to be?
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.580]   'Cause you know what, every single day, God,
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.860]   I wake up and there's things that fight for my heart,
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:33.660]   anxiety that can fill my mind,
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.860]   distractions that make me think I don't have enough money,
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:38.740]   I don't have enough appreciation from other people,
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.580]   things that can make me think that I'm entitled
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:42.280]   more than I am or entitled in general
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   and just can flood my mind, distractions.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.060]   Man, there's women that I wanna lust over all the time.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.660]   How do I become someone who's the husband, the father,
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.200]   the man, the pastor, the person,
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.860]   the follower of Jesus that I wanna be?
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.700]   How?
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.100]   It's not by just waking up and saying,
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.140]   you know what, today's my day, I'm gonna try harder.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.020]   It's by saying, God, I don't have the strength,
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.860]   listen to me very closely, 'cause I don't want you to leave
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.120]   with all the different things that I've said
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.180]   and walk away being like, yeah, just really like,
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.200]   go help, self-help.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.020]   You're not strong enough and neither am I
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.260]   to become the man that I wanna be.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.660]   You're not strong enough to become the woman
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:17.500]   that you wanna be.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.860]   You can't conquer anxiety.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.900]   You can't conquer lust.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.580]   You can't conquer all the self-identity and problems
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.580]   like, you know why I know that?
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.500]   Because if you could, you already would have.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.820]   You're not strong enough on your own and neither am I.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.300]   And so the moment that we experience freedom from those
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.940]   is when we go, God, I need your help.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.580]   I surrender, I need your help.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.100]   And I don't need it just for all the time, though.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:41.940]   I need it all the time.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:42.820]   I need it just for today.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.860]   Will you help me today, God?
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.420]   Will you help me in this moment where I'm feeling temptation
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.700]   to not be your man, to not be the man that I wanna be?
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.740]   Will you help me right now, God?
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:53.300]   I need your help, God, I need your help.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.140]   Just moment by moment, moment by moment,
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.000]   I surrender my life.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.060]   It's the same way you become a Christian.
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.140]   Christians don't try harder.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.380]   And then you can be in relationship with God.
[00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.260]   They say, God, I can't, I don't deserve it.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:08.420]   I'm not good enough on my own.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:10.020]   I need your help.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.820]   I surrender.
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.180]   You pay for it.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.380]   If I'm gonna have a relationship with you,
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.940]   it's not because of me.
[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.660]   I surrender.
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.900]   I need your help.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.700]   That is how you live the Christian life.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.020]   That's how your 20s thrive and roar.
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.780]   How about you getting so motivated, you walk out of here
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.420]   and you're like, I'm never sinning again.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.180]   By moment by moment, God, I need you.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.100]   I surrender.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.060]   I need your help.
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.260]   I can't be who I want to be without you.
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.240]   Will you help me?
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:40.780]   And in those moments, God doesn't just move his spirit in
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.420]   and that's how he saves somebody.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.620]   Those are the moments that he directs and sows
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.060]   and moves our lives and the directions that we want them to,
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.540]   that he wants them to.
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.260]   So we say, God, you drive.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:54.600]   You're the Lord.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.860]   I give you my life.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.900]   I give you this day.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.900]   I wanna give you this moment.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.340]   Help me.
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.260]   Let me pray.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.160]   Father, I pray.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.060]   Man, for just friends in here that feel
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:13.180]   like they're too far,
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.580]   like they're damaged goods.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:22.180]   They'll never be able to have the story that they hoped for.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.780]   They're not even sure that you are God
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:32.780]   whose word and love and life was given for them.
[00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:37.360]   You would meet them where they are right now.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.400]   The spirit of God would overwhelm and flood their heart
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.500]   as you say it does in Romans chapter five.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.840]   And you would give them a vision for the life
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.160]   that's bigger than anything they've ever dreamed.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.880]   Father, I pray for men and women in this room
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.580]   who are gonna run and they're not gonna listen
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.300]   and they're not gonna use their 20s and you love them.
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.480]   And there's parts of all of our hearts that wanna run.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:03.320]   Would you help us?
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.240]   Would you win?
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.960]   Would you be greater and stronger
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.640]   in those moments as we surrender to you?
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.500]   And I thank you, God, for the men and women
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.440]   who are sowing seeds of life.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.320]   Would you multiply those seeds as you do when we sow them?
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.760]   And would you spread a movement of their kind
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.040]   across our country of young adults surrendered
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.520]   and walking surrendered to you day by day?
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.240]   In Christ's name, amen.
