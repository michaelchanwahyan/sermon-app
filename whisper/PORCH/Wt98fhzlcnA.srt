 [Music]

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 All right, all right, all right. Porch, how we doing? Doing okay? Yes? Hey, it's great to be back with you tonight.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 So grateful that you joined us from wherever it is you came from. I don't know if you're here from out of town,

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 if you're a regular in the room. We always have some Porch Live locations tuning in with us on Tuesday nights as well.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So special shout out to all of you that are tuning in with us online, especially Fresno, Scottsdale, Tulsa.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 We love you. Thanks for being here with us. Hey, we've been in the middle of a series in the book of Colossians,

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 which we're continuing tonight, but I want to open up with an illustration, which I think may be helpful.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I remember starting my first job out of college and finding the experience confusing to say the least.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Anybody have that same experience? You jump out of college, you get into your first job, and you're like,

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 "What is happening right now? This is not at all like what I expected."

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Let me explain to you why that was the case for me. You see, normally, when you step out of college,

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 you walk the stage, you make your way into your first job. You are in the midst of a lot of anew.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You've moved into a new city. You've found a new place to live.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 You've committed to a new set of responsibilities during your week. You're trying to find new friends.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 You're trying to understand the new landscape, a part of which you are now calling home.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 This is the case for many of us when we step into a new job, especially out of college.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But this was not the case for me because I graduated and I stayed right where I was.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I didn't move cities. I didn't change locales. I didn't even leave the place where I was living.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I stayed in College Station, Texas, because I went to Texas A&M University,

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 aka the promised land. It's a holy place. Hang in there with me.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 No, I stayed in the same city which I had spent the last four years at that time,

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 which meant that I lived a lot of the same normal regularities for me that I had lived previously.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I had the same roommates, and I lived in the same house, and I went to the same restaurants,

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 and I went to the same gym, and I went to the same church.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I was a part of all of these sames that had been a part of my story.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 They were continuing forward for me, which sounds really great, right?

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Man, that sounds nice. You can acclimate to a new job.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 You can be a part of a new set of normal rhythms while also having all the same friends

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 in all the same places and all the same things, which you would think is true,

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 but was not the case for me. You see, because with a new job came a new way of life,

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 and with that new way of life came a new set of expectations.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 You see, where the old me would choose to skip class if he wanted to—totally hypothetical—

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 the new me could not skip work. Where the old me could choose to take as many hours as he wanted for lunch,

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 the new me got one hour for lunch every single day.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Where the old me would look at his week and say, "Man, I don't have as much work to do as I thought."

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 The new me would look at his week and realize, "I have plenty of work to do."

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Where the old me could spend as much time as he wanted at the gym,

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 the new me had to either get up in the morning or go at the end of the day.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 My old rhythms did not fit with my new way of life.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Which sounds pretty miserable, right? You would think it's great,

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 but then you hear, "Man, you're not able to enjoy any of the same things you used to

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 because of the new way of life you're now a part of?" That sounds awful.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And yet, I would tell you, it was amazing. Why?

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Because though it was disorienting, I was kind of in my old stomping grounds

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 while still living a new way of life. That new way of life was worthy of figuring out.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And the reason for it is because I loved everything it afforded me.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 The opportunities it gave me to grow and the lessons it would teach me,

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 the responsibilities that were imparted to me, the money that I made,

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 the team that I joined, the company I worked for,

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 the fact that I didn't have to go to class.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Instead, I was entrusted with something that was meaningful.

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I loved all of this that was now a part of my new way of life.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 But here's the thing that you need to know.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I tell you that because when you step into a new way of life,

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 there are often new lessons to learn.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 That was true for me. I wasn't able to just do the things that I had done.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I now had to do new things instead.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And that is the case for those that place their faith in Jesus Christ.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 When you step into life with Christ, you embark upon a new chapter of life.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And everything changes for you.

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Like you get new opportunities to grow.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 You get new experiences to enjoy, community to find, responsibilities to sue.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 You get all of this newness, which is really amazing.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And yet, with that new way of life, come new lessons you have to learn.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I tell you that because that's where we're at tonight.

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 You see, we've been journeying through the book of Colossians.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And as we come to chapter 2, which is where we are this evening,

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 that you can turn to right now if you want,

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Paul is hinging from everything he's been saying,

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 pointing to, hey, this is what it looks like to walk into relationship with Jesus

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and then walk out of that relationship as you live your life forward

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 to now talking about what's next,

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 which is important and relevant for the Colossians that he's writing to.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Because this group of young believers, they are asking the question,

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 we've placed our faith in Jesus.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 We understand everything you're saying, Paul.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But now what? We want to move forward.

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 We want to mature in our spirituality.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 We want to advance. We want to take new ground.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 We want to get better, which may feel like you.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 You've been walking with Jesus.

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Maybe you've just recently started investigating the person of Christ

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 and you're trying to evaluate for yourself.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Okay, I'm kind of into this. I believe in him even.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 But where do I go from here?

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 This is the question the Colossians are asking as well.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 They want to know what it looks like to not just be as they are,

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 but to become everything that God wants them to be.

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And so Paul, he moves into chapter 2

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 and he starts to write to them a series of lessons they need to learn.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And he's doing so to refute a lot of the lessons

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 the world is perpetuating at them instead.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You see, in their context,

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 there's this thing known as the Colossian heresy.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And basically, it's a group of false teachers

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 that are looking at them and saying,

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 hey, if you want to find superior spirituality,

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 if you want to advance into a greater human experience,

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 add all this other stuff to your life.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Like believe in these different things.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Acquire this new knowledge.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And Paul is saying, as we transition from 1 to chapter 2,

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 looking at verse 3, he says, you don't have to do that.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Because in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You don't need to look anywhere else.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 If you want to grow and go forward,

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 the way you do it is by looking to him.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 We've said this.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Maturity in life comes through clarity of Christ.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 That's the big topic, the main theme of this entire book.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And as we move forward into the rest of Paul's letter,

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 he's going to begin to unpack for us

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 what specific lessons we need to learn

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 if we want to walk into the wholehearted fullness

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 that is available in Jesus.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So this is what he says, starting in verse 6.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 "Therefore, in light of the fact that you do believe in him,

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 as you received Christ Jesus the Lord,

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 so walk in him, rooted and built up in him,

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 established in the faith, just as you were taught,

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 abounding in thanksgiving."

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 How does Paul choose to teach these young believers

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 the way of walking in Jesus?

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 How is he going to teach us the way of walking in Jesus?

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 In a really strategic way.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 He looks at them and he says,

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 "Hey, you need to learn how to walk in him

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 by comparing it to the way in which you received him."

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Which is a really great strategy

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 for teaching somebody something.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 How do I do that?

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Do this the way you did that.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 The way you did X, now you go do Y.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 That's what he's saying.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Which begs the question then,

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 how did they receive Christ?

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 With extreme care.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 That's what they do.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 They received Christ with extreme care.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Because Paul uses a term here that's interesting.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's actually a technical word in Judaism

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 that refers to the transmission of teaching

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 from one person or generation to another.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So just think about that most beloved family recipe

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 that you have.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 That thing which has been handed down

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 with painstaking care from one generation to the next.

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 What is it for you?

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 That is how they have received the good news of Jesus Christ.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 With painstaking detail.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 With meticulous care.

152
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 They haven't just received it carelessly.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 They've received it carefully.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 There's nothing casual about this.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 They heard the good news of Jesus

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 and they received it with intense focus.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 They wanted to learn.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They had heard the stories of this man.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 They had read the reports of what he'd done.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 They had even learned of his impact

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 in the lives of other people.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And they said, "We've received this.

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So now what do we do?

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 We want to believe this.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So we've acquired great knowledge of these things."

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 You see, their lives were transformed

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 because their hearts were transfixed

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 on the one who would come to save them.

169
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And, Ports, the same should be true for us.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Which is why it's really important

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 when we talk about faith in Jesus,

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 believing in God,

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 that we don't just pin our faith

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 on the basis of something really rather weak.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 That's why it's not enough to believe in Christ

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 because your parents do.

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Or to follow Jesus because it's socially advantageous

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 to do that here in the South.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 It's a good way to meet people and find friends.

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 We don't walk with God

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 because our boyfriend or our girlfriend,

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 they kind of like him, and so I guess I should like him as well

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 because I want that relationship to sustain.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We don't follow him because we want to get out of hell free card.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 These are all bad reasons to walk with Jesus.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Contrary to popular belief,

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 there are in fact bad testimonies out there.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 What makes a bad testimony?

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Not the absence of divine intervention.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 "Man, there's not really like a burning bush

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 or a pillar of fire in my story."

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 That doesn't make a bad testimony.

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 There are loads of people like that.

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 What makes a bad testimony

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 is not the absence of divine intervention,

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 but the presence of personal indifference.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 "I don't really care. He seems like a nice guy.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I guess I should religiously ascribe to someone.

199
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 It might as well be him."

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Paul's saying, "You don't receive Christ like that."

201
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 That's not how they've received him.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 They've received him with great care.

203
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 They are absolutely, utterly transformed

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 because they are totally transfixed on this man, Jesus Christ.

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And the same should be true for us.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 You see, we don't believe in Jesus because it's convenient.

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 We believe in Jesus because we're convinced.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 We're convinced.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 We've heard the facts of his life.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 We've read the report ourselves.

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We've beheld the beauty of his character.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 We've observed the wonder of his nature.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And we've received his forgiveness firsthand.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And because we've done these things,

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 we can't help but believe.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We can't help but be spurned forward towards more.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And we can't help but want to learn as much as possible.

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Paul is saying, in the same way that we've received him like that,

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 as undeniably true, like, "Man, I cannot refute the fact that this is all actually accurate."

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 The way that we've received him as that is the way we should walk in him.

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 You received him with great focus.

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 You should walk in him with great focus.

223
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 That's what he's saying.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 As he moves through this, he moves from the indicative form to the imperative form.

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Which just means he makes an indicative statement.

226
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 He indicates something that's true.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 He makes a statement of fact.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 You received Christ.

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 That's observable. That's factual.

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 We can say that that actually happened.

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 He moves from an indicative statement, you've received him,

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 to an imperative statement, which is a command.

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So then do this.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 That's where he moves as he goes along.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 He says there's no hiatus between believing in Jesus and behaving like a Jesus follower.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 They go hand in hand.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Their two sisters tied at the hip.

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 You place your faith, you walk in him.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It just goes together.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 That's what he's unpacking for us.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Why? Why is that the case?

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Because Jesus is not just a nice guy.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Like he's not just a lesser household God.

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 He's not just a mythological hero.

245
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Someone we study in books.

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 The reason there's no gap, no hiatus, no distance,

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 between a believer and Christ-like behavior

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 is because Jesus is Lord.

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 That's why.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 That's what he points to.

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 You see, Paul's first lesson to us is this.

252
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 If you have received Christ and you want to walk in him,

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 then the claim that Jesus is Lord

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 should be met with the reality that you treat him as Lord.

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 If you say Jesus is Lord, then you treat Jesus as Lord.

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Which begs the question for all of us,

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 what's a Lord do?

258
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Do we have any Lords in America?

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I was thinking about this in the green room just a minute ago before I came out here.

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 My staff, we have a variety of different office spaces.

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Some of us sit in offices, others of us sit in cubicles.

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 My personal assistant, she has a cubicle.

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It's right outside of my house.

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 She is the Lord of her cubicle.

265
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 She rules over all that happens within that cubicle.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 She reigns over it.

267
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 That's what it means to Lord over something.

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 So, if Jesus is Lord, what kind of Lord is he?

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 What's the extent of his reign?

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 How great is his reach?

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Philippians 2 tells us, it says,

272
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 "Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Like, who is Jesus Lord of?

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Every name, every knee, and every tongue.

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 He's over it all.

278
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Which makes the claim that if he is the Lord of my life,

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 then I absolutely should treat him as the Lord of my life.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I walk in him. That's important.

281
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Paul says, "You walk in him."

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Not ahead of him, that he's someone you outpace,

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 that needs to catch up to your lifestyle.

284
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Not behind him, because you don't want to be associated with him.

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Not around him, because he's a problem or an inconvenience to avoid.

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 No, you don't walk in front of him, behind him, around him.

287
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 You walk in him.

288
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 In him.

289
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 He is in complete totality, fully surrounding all of your being.

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Right?

291
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Have you ever put on one of those giant bubble soccer uniforms?

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Jesus is like the bubble.

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 He surrounds your entire being.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 He has lordship over every aspect of who you are.

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And he has a lordship that says,

296
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 "I care enough and I'm capable enough to provide for you."

297
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 How do we know that?

298
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 How do we know that Jesus cares and is capable?

299
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Because he cares enough to lay his life down.

300
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And he's capable enough to take his life up.

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He loves you and he's powerful for your sake.

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So as you walk in him, totally encompassed,

303
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 you're safe, you're provided for, you're protected.

304
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 This is the good news of the gospel.

305
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 That when you receive Christ, you don't just get part of him.

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 You get all of him.

307
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But he also gets all of you.

308
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Because that's what Paul is saying next.

309
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 You walk in him.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And then he gives you four descriptors of how you're supposed to walk in Jesus.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 What does he say?

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He says, "Walk in him, rooted and built up, established in the faith,

313
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving."

314
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 He gives four descriptors for what it looks like to walk in Jesus.

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Walk in him, rooted in him, built up in him, established in him,

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 and abounding in thanksgiving.

317
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Which can feel really overwhelming.

318
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Like you may be here tonight and you're just trying to figure out the whole Jesus thing.

319
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And then you hear a list of punch items that you need to accomplish

320
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 or a checklist that you need to work through.

321
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Oh, I'm supposed to root myself in him, be built up in him,

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 establish my life in him, and be thankful?

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Like that sounds exhausting.

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Like this is overwhelming.

325
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 This is why I want nothing to do with religion.

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 If that's what you're hearing as Paul works through these descriptors of how we walk in Jesus,

327
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 let me just help you understand that's not what he's saying.

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 He's not looking at you and saying, "You've placed your faith in him.

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You've signed on the dotted line."

330
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Perfect. Okay, let's get to work.

331
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 We've got a bunch of different things that we need to do.

332
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 You first need to get rooted, then you got to get built,

333
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 then you got to get established, and then you get thankful.

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 You ready? Here we go.

335
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Like that's not Paul's perspective on your life.

336
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 If you've made a claim of faith in Jesus.

337
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 No, he looks at you and he says, "This is actually going to be much easier than you think."

338
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I'm not going to bore you with the grammar.

339
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 But if you go and you study the way that Paul writes this,

340
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 these four descriptors actually leave you with really only one thing.

341
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 You're truly, personally responsible for.

342
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 He says you're rooted in Christ.

343
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 When he says that you are rooted in Christ, he is saying you are already completely rooted.

344
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 It's complete. It's done.

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 It's in the perfect tense, which means there's nothing you can add to it.

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 You have been rooted in Christ.

347
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 You place your faith, you're rooted, you're safe, you're secure.

348
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And yet, it doesn't just mean that you're completely rooted,

349
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 you're also continually being built up.

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You're being built up and you're growing stronger.

351
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Like that's a continual process.

352
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It's one where when you study it, you partner together with God.

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 God's going to help you grow and girder.

354
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 He's going to make you taller and stronger.

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But your participation is required, right?

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Completely rooted, continually built up and established.

357
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And then lastly, you're consciously thankful.

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Consciously thankful.

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 That's your job.

360
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 That's what he leaves you to do.

361
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Hey man, we're going to work it out together.

362
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You're rooted. We're going to partner.

363
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 You just be thankful that it's all happening.

364
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Is God egotistical?

365
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Does he just need you to be glad that he's involved in your life?

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Heap up some praise, lift up some hands.

367
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Is that his perspective?

368
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Is that his heart's posture?

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 No.

370
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 If you're going to lift thanks to God, what does it require?

371
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 That you see something worthy of rejoicing in.

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 God's heart for us is that we would look at him and we would see a

373
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 bounty of thanksgiving.

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And as we see that, it would lead us into great gladness.

375
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Irrefutable joy.

376
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Indomitable praise.

377
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Because God is good.

378
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He's saying, hey, I need you to be thankful.

379
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 How does that happen?

380
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Just look at me.

381
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Get more of me.

382
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Lean in.

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Acquire as much as you want.

384
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 There's so much here.

385
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I'm so good.

386
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And the longer you look, the more gratitude you'll feel.

387
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 This is what it means to walk in Jesus.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 These four things.

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 This is the first lesson he gives.

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 He's saying, hey, if Jesus is your Lord, then you treat him like your Lord.

391
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 But that's not the only lesson he offers.

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 He keeps going.

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 He says, see to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and

394
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 empty deceit according to human tradition.

395
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 According to the elemental spirits of the world and not according to

396
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Christ.

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 For in him the whole fullness of the deity dwells bodily.

398
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 The second lesson that Paul wants us to know is the world will offer you

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 what only Jesus can give.

400
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 The world will offer you what only Jesus can give.

401
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 When Paul says, see to it that no one takes you captive in verse 8.

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 We're meant to read that with a strong warning that dangers are nearby.

403
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Right?

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So when you go to the beach, there are certain flags that the lifeguards

405
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 will raise in order to what?

406
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Alert you to present dangers in the waters.

407
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Red flags mean there's a rip current.

408
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Water's not safe.

409
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Purple flag means dangerous marine life present.

410
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Which means there's something out in the water that you may not want to

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 tango with.

412
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 What would happen if you walked out into those waters and you did not pay

413
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 attention to the warning sign?

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 You might find yourself face to face in your chubbies with an apex

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 predator.

416
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Which is a really bad spot to be in.

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Can we just admit it?

418
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Like I know you think you're bad, but that's not a good position to find

419
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 yourself a part of.

420
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Paul is saying, hey, I'm raising a flag.

421
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Take notice.

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Look at this.

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 There's danger around.

424
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He's using predatory language.

425
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 You see the Greek word here for captive is a compound word that literally

426
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 means to carry prey off.

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 It's to carry prey or victims.

428
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 So he's saying, hey, when you walk through this world, there are going to

429
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 be a myriad of people, a variety of voices that are looking at you and

430
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 saying, hey, follow this.

431
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Do this.

432
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Trust this teaching.

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And yet, though they may seem trustworthy, they do not have your best

434
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 interest at heart.

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 They're going to spend something super captivating.

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Key word, captive.

437
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 They want to take you hostage.

438
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And so he's alerting you.

439
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You be aware.

440
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 It's like what advertisers do in fast food commercials.

441
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You know what I'm talking about.

442
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Why do those pancakes stack so high when you look at them upon the

443
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 billboard?

444
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Because the marketers have wedged cardboard between every single one of

445
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 them.

446
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And that syrup just looks amazing.

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Yeah, it's because it's motor oil.

448
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Or like that picture of your favorite pie with that perfect dollop of

449
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 whipped cream on top.

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Yeah, that's shaving cream.

451
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Or the cheese pizza that just looks so ooey gooey delicious.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 It's not ooey gooey.

453
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 It's ooey gluey.

454
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's glue.

455
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It's not cheese.

456
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 It's not that.

457
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 It's false advertising to you.

458
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 They look trustworthy.

459
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 But they're not to be messed with.

460
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 The world in the same way will falsely advertise to you.

461
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 False teachings, heretical ideas, they aren't immediately obvious or

462
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 glaringly wrong.

463
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 They won't simply stand out as bad for the Colossians.

464
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 These false ideas, they come through what Paul describes as human

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 tradition and elemental spirits.

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Why does that matter to us?

467
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 That just sounds like a lot of religious speak.

468
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 But what is he talking about?

469
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 He says, hey, they're preaching to you Colossians with human tradition

470
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 and elemental spirits.

471
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 He's saying, hey, they're going to speak to you something that looks like

472
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 it has a ton of veracity.

473
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Because the more ancient the tradition or the more elemental, fundamental,

474
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 the spirit, the more veracity that it was true in this ancient context.

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 The older it was, the better it was.

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 That's the way to put it simply.

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 The irony of that is for us in our modern day, it's not the old things

478
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 that demand our attention, it's the new things.

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 We see something new and we deem that it's best.

480
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 We look at something that is improved and we actually assume it's an

481
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 improvement.

482
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 But Jesus himself, he tells us in Matthew 10, 16, he says, hey, behold,

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I'm going to send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves,

484
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 more predatory language.

485
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 So you be wise.

486
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 You be wise as serpents and you be innocent as doves.

487
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 You have discernment and you have blamelessness.

488
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 You see, as we move through this world, we're meant to be discerning.

489
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Knowing full well the world will over promise and under deliver every time.

490
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Hey, if you want to find fulfillment, let's talk about your job.

491
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 You just invest in your career because there's a goal that you want to reach.

492
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Yes, like let's just hustle harder.

493
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Give up more time, compromise more of your morals, and you'll eventually

494
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 ascend to that platform, into that position.

495
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You'll attain all of that responsibility and it's going to be awesome.

496
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And then you get there.

497
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 You climb the proverbial ladder and as you stand at that spot,

498
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 you realize there's only one more rung to climb.

499
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You're still in fact as far behind as another group of people as you felt

500
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 from where you first were before.

501
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 You're not nearly as happy here as you anticipated you would.

502
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 This is with your career.

503
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 This could be in anything.

504
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 This could be in relationships.

505
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 This could be in reputation.

506
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I want to be someone that's admirable, respected.

507
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I want to make a difference in the world.

508
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 It could be something about pleasure, experience.

509
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 Listen, these things are not inherently bad.

510
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 In fact, they're pretty important.

511
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Career, relationship, reputation, these things are good things.

512
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 They're important things.

513
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 Porch, they're not ultimate things.

514
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And thus, because they are not ultimate, they will never satisfy.

515
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 They will not deliver on the promise they've made that fullness is right here.

516
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Step right up and take as much as you want.

517
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 How do I know that that's the case?

518
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Because there is one who is ultimate where fullness is actually found.

519
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 That's what Paul says.

520
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 He says in verse 9, "For in him, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,

521
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 and you have been filled in him who is the head of all rule and authority."

522
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 All the fullness of God dwells in this man, Jesus.

523
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So all the fullness you seek, guess where it's found?

524
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 In him as well.

525
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 It's interesting.

526
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 I talk to young adults all the time.

527
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 And as I visit with them, often what I find myself engaging in conversation about

528
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 is that their job just isn't as life-giving as they thought it would be.

529
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Or their friend group's just not as life-giving as they thought it would be.

530
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Or that commitment they made, that leadership position they have,

531
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 that volunteer role they hold.

532
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Man, it's just not giving me life.

533
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 It's not supposed to.

534
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 No job, no relationship, no group of friends is supposed to give you life.

535
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 For us to say that language in the church, within the walls of this own building,

536
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 shows that the world has permeated our midst.

537
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 It's come inside.

538
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I'm looking at you and it's saying, "There is something we could add to Jesus."

539
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Have you thought about X, Y, and Z?

540
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Those things are not meant to give you life.

541
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He is.

542
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 That's why all things are meant to be done to the glory of God,

543
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 because it's in the glory of God that you find rich satisfaction.

544
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 This statement, "fullness of deity" that Paul uses,

545
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 it's loaded with meaning.

546
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Because in the Old Testament, any time the word "fullness" pops up,

547
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 it's most often talking about the presence of God, the fullness of God.

548
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 And any time "deity" pops up, it's talking about the essence of God.

549
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 So when he says "fullness of deity,"

550
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 he's saying the presence and the expression, the essence of God,

551
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 they're found in Jesus.

552
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 All of God's person, his being, and all of his personality, his doing,

553
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 it's in him.

554
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 That's where you can find it.

555
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 That's why fullness is available.

556
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 What Paul is getting at is that Jesus is God.

557
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Unbelievable.

558
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Have you seen him?

559
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 He's unbelievable.

560
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Become God perceivable.

561
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 He is God's transcendence.

562
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 He is God's eminence.

563
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Power in the form of a person.

564
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 That's what we talked about last week.

565
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And that's what Paul is hammering at right here.

566
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 He's the fullness of God.

567
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 So in him we find the fulfillment for ourselves.

568
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 But it's not just that.

569
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 In verse 11, "In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands,

570
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,

571
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 having been buried with him in baptism,

572
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God,

573
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 who raised him from the dead."

574
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Without getting into too much detail,

575
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 circumcision was a physical sign in the Old Testament for the people of God

576
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 that Paul is referencing right here to refute this claim

577
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 that because the Colossians are not ethnic Jews,

578
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 they can't be a part of the people of God.

579
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 You're not circumcised, so you can't be in here.

580
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 He's saying that's not true.

581
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 That's not actually the case.

582
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 He's saying, no, it's not by human hands that you become a part of God's family.

583
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 It's by way of God's own hands.

584
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 That's what he does.

585
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 It's not a circumcision physically.

586
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 It's a circumcision spiritually.

587
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 It's of the heart.

588
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 He says it like this in Romans 2, 29.

589
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 "But a Jew, an ethnic Jew, is one inwardly,

590
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 and circumcision is a matter of the heart."

591
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 He's saying if you want to be identified with the people of God,

592
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 it's not by blood, it's by spirit.

593
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 That happens inwardly.

594
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Circumcision is a matter of the heart by God's spirit,

595
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 not by the letter of the law.

596
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 His praise is not from man, it's from God.

597
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Which is good news to us.

598
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Because what Paul is saying is,

599
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 if you want to be in the family of God,

600
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 the door is open for anyone and everyone.

601
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 There is no barrier to entry.

602
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 You can come in here.

603
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 You can grab a seat at the table.

604
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Anyone is welcome here because God is the one that brings people into his family,

605
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 and he does not discriminate.

606
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Everyone is welcome right here.

607
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 How, Paul?

608
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 How is that the case?

609
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Because that unbelievable God that has become a perceivable God in Jesus,

610
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 don't miss this,

611
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 has also become a receivable God.

612
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 He's not just a God you can know.

613
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 He's a God you can have.

614
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Because that's Jesus' heart.

615
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He wants you in his family.

616
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 That's why he came.

617
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 He came to cross the divide,

618
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 to bridge the void and bring you back to God himself.

619
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And not just save you from your sin,

620
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 but save you into a whole new way of life

621
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 in fullness forevermore.

622
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 The reason this matters for our room

623
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 is because some of us here

624
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 feel a lot like these Colossians.

625
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 We do feel like there's a barrier to entry for us.

626
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 We do feel like we don't belong in the family of God.

627
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 We look at ourselves and we say,

628
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 "You don't know what I've done."

629
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 "Have you seen my resume,

630
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 the mistakes that are littered thereupon?"

631
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 "I'm disqualified from this thing."

632
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 "I'm unqualified to get in."

633
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 "I'm inadequate to be a part of God's family."

634
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 "I have a stain so deep, no one can clean it."

635
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 And yet God is looking at you and saying,

636
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 "No, I can clean it."

637
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 "How?"

638
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 "By my own blood."

639
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 "I will clean you."

640
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 "I will wash you out of snow."

641
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 "I will bring you to myself."

642
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 "And you will remain with me forever."

643
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 This is such good news

644
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 because it's not a result of anything we do.

645
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 It is in spite of everything we've done

646
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 that we come into the family of God.

647
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 And it's through the person of Jesus.

648
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 That's what Paul unpacks for us

649
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 as we continue into our final point.

650
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 He says in verse 13,

651
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 "And you, who were dead in your trespasses

652
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and the uncircumcision of your flesh,

653
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 God made alive together with him,

654
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 having forgiven us all our trespasses,

655
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 by canceling the record of debt that stood against us

656
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 with its legal demands.

657
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.

658
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 He disarmed the rulers and authorities,

659
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 and he put them to open shame

660
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 by triumphing over them in him."

661
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Paul turns the corner,

662
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 and he gives us our final lesson

663
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 that those fully forgiven should live fully free.

664
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Those fully forgiven should live fully free.

665
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 What's the best motivation for living free?

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 The reminder of what you've been freed from, right?

667
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Anytime I speak to my nieces and my nephews

668
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 and I learn about their schoolwork,

669
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I rejoice, man, 'cause those days are behind me, you know?

670
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 I'm reminded of what I've been freed from.

671
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 I have graduated from the imprisonment

672
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 of my former education,

673
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 and now I don't have to do those things any longer.

674
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 When you're reminded of what you've been freed from,

675
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 you're motivated to live into your freedom.

676
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 That's what Paul's pointing to.

677
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 That's why he spends the next three verses

678
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 unpacking specifically three problems

679
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 we've been delivered from.

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 He wants to add fuel to your freedom.

681
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 He wants to pour gas onto your gratitude.

682
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 So what are the three things that we've been delivered from?

683
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Verse 13, regret from our past.

684
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Verse 14, debt for our sin.

685
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And verse 15, threat of the enemy.

686
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Regret from our past.

687
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 These are the things which result

688
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 from the trespasses Paul talks about in verse 13,

689
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 which raises the question, what does it mean to trespass?

690
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 In the Greek, it literally means to take a false step,

691
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 to go somewhere you're not supposed to be.

692
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 When I was in high school,

693
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 every summer my youth group, we would take a mission trip,

694
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 which meant every summer,

695
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 we would inevitably prank the girls.

696
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 The boys would go on this trip,

697
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 and we would, like a thief in the night,

698
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 try to prank the girls.

699
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 We would try to go into their quarters

700
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and absolutely wreak havoc and leave them a memory

701
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 worth telling about for days forward.

702
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 How would we do it?

703
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 We would trespass.

704
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 That's how we would do it.

705
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 We would sneak into their room under the cover of nightfall.

706
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 We would do so after our chaperones had fallen asleep.

707
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 We would execute plans that we had carefully

708
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 and meticulously prepared.

709
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Plans that included things like cling-wrapping toilets

710
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 and hanging cheese puffs above their door

711
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 so that when they opened it, it would rain down upon them,

712
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 filling their shower heads with Kool-Aid

713
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 so that we would leave them oh-so-sticky.

714
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Very devious exploits.

715
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 This is what we would do.

716
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 We would trespass in order to make it happen.

717
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 We would go someplace we shouldn't have been

718
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 to do something we shouldn't have done.

719
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 This is what Paul's talking about.

720
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 He's saying, "Hey, you've not only trespassed

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 "against one another, you have trespassed against God."

722
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 We've lived our lives selfishly,

723
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 hating God, hurting one another.

724
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Romans says that even our conscience

725
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 bears witness against us, that intrinsically,

726
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 we know the world is not as it should be, nor am I.

727
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 And so he's saying, "Hey, you are filled with regret.

728
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 "You know you are not doing what you should,

729
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 "and you have good reason for doing it right."

730
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And yet, because of what Jesus Christ has done upon his cross,

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 he has answered for every single one of our trespasses.

732
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Everything we've done wrong,

733
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 every place we never should have been,

734
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 he has borne the full consequence of it

735
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 in himself upon his cross.

736
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 And thus, we have no reason to regret any longer.

737
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 We have every reason to rejoice.

738
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 That's what he's pointing towards.

739
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 We have been freed from our regret.

740
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 We have absolutely been relinquished from those things

741
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 which held us in shame and guilt and condemnation.

742
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 But it's not just that.

743
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 We've not just been freed from our regret.

744
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 We've also been freed from debt of our sin.

745
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Verse 14 says that God made us alive

746
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 by canceling the record of debt that stood against us

747
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 with its legal demands.

748
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 This he set aside.

749
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 He nailed it to the cross.

750
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 What does that mean?

751
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Our sin against God had racked up a huge tab,

752
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 one that we could not pay.

753
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 And so Jesus stepped in our place,

754
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 and he paid the balance in full.

755
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 How did he pay it?

756
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 With his own life.

757
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 He has canceled the record of debt.

758
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 There's nothing that can hold you bound captive

759
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 to sin and death any longer

760
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 because he has paid it completely.

761
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 Romans 8, 33, 35, 37 says,

762
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?"

763
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 It is God who justifies.

764
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Who is to condemn?

765
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Christ Jesus is the one who died.

766
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 More than that, was raised.

767
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Who is at the right hand of God?

768
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Who indeed is interceding for us right now?

769
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

770
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Shall tribulation or distress or persecution

771
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?

772
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 No.

773
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 In all these things,

774
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 we're more than conquerors through him who loved us.

775
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 We've been freed from any debt for our sin,

776
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 and we've also been freed from the threat of the enemy.

777
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 When he gets to verse 15, he says that he, Jesus,

778
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 disarmed the rulers and authorities,

779
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 and he put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him.

780
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Paul uses an image when he says the word triumph

781
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 that would have struck a chord with his audience.

782
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 You see, this word triumph, it's a word picture.

783
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 That when a king would return after vanquishing an enemy,

784
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 he would carry in his train all those foes

785
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 which he has now brought captive.

786
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And as he parades his enemy through his city's streets,

787
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 triumphing over them in full,

788
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 that king's people can look upon that enemy,

789
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 the one who once harmed them,

790
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 and realize he has been rendered harmless.

791
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 And I have reason to praise.

792
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 I have reason to celebrate.

793
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 I have reason to build in confidence

794
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 because I am associated with one

795
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 who could defeat my threat for me.

796
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 We have no reason to fear.

797
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 There are no longer any regrets for those in Christ Jesus.

798
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 There is no longer a debt of sin against you,

799
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 and there is no power or threat from an enemy.

800
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 All of it has been ultimately, finally,

801
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 and totally overwhelmed by Jesus Christ himself.

802
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Do you know him?

803
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 This man who is the Lord, the Lord God.

804
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Like Jesus is over everything.

805
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 He is supreme.

806
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 He is dominating in all of his power,

807
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 and yet he is also tender in all of his care.

808
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 He's Lord over all, including you.

809
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Will you not treat him as such?

810
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 Will you not submit to him?

811
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 For he and he alone offers the fullness of life,

812
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 which you are desperate to find.

813
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 Jesus came to give life.

814
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 The Lord God became a servant to man,

815
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 and in giving life to us,

816
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 he laid down his life to accomplish it completely.

817
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 He poured himself out as an offering to God on our behalf.

818
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 The wages of sin is death.

819
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Christ has borne our death.

820
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 That way we may no longer worry or fear

821
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 that death is still ahead.

822
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 We have nothing to sit in trepidation over

823
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 because Christ Jesus has come to give us life,

824
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 but not just that he has come to fully forgive,

825
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 that we might be fully free.

826
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Jesus did die, but he didn't stay there.

827
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 He rose forth from the grave.

828
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Like he burst forth from his tomb,

829
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 and in so doing, he has declared,

830
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 "Hey, there's not just forgiveness for you.

831
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 "There is freedom.

832
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 "I've risen that you might rise,

833
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 "that you can come with me where I am."

834
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Not just one day out in eternity, though that's true.

835
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 You can live into all the freedom available

836
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 by way of my resurrection right now.

837
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 This is the gospel.

838
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Will you walk in it?

839
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 Let me pray for us.

840
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Father, so thankful just to teach your word.

841
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 So grateful, God, that through it, you've spoken to us.

842
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 God, I thank you that I have friends here

843
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 in this room tonight,

844
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 that God are truly across a spectrum of spirituality.

845
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Some in here, God, that have walked with you for so long,

846
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 that God are in fact rooted,

847
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 and they are being built up and established, God,

848
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 and they do rejoice and give thanksgiving.

849
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 But others, God, here as well,

850
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 that they don't know you.

851
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You just stumbled into this space.

852
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 They wandered in haphazardly, God.

853
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 I'm thankful, Lord, that there's not a soul in this room

854
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 here by happenstance.

855
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 All, including you, brother or sister,

856
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 are here because he willed it to be.

857
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 There is something from his word,

858
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 something in this room that he wants for you tonight.

859
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Maybe it's his lordship

860
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 and the provision and safety that comes with it.

861
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Maybe it's the life he offers

862
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 and the fact that with him, fullness is actually found.

863
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Maybe it's forgiveness that leads unto freedom.

864
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 I don't know what it is for you,

865
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 but you are here because he wants something for you.

866
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 That's the heart of our God.

867
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 He doesn't need anything from you.

868
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 We can add nothing to him,

869
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 but he wants everything for us.

870
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 He's a good God, and his name is Jesus Christ.

871
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 He is a king that has come to lead all captives home,

872
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 for he has overcome anything that would imprison,

873
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 enslave, or separate us from God forever.

874
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 We're so thankful, God, that this is true.

875
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 We rejoice in you,

876
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 and it's in your name we pray, amen.

877
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 Porch, let's stand together, if you would, right now.

878
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Yeah, I don't know what tonight's felt like for you.

879
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 I don't know what God's doing in this moment,

880
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 but I would just ask, not for my sake,

881
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 I'm gonna be here next week, but for yours.

882
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Don't rush out.

883
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Don't race away.

884
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 God's been working to this moment now,

885
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 and he wants to meet with you.

886
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 He wants to take you further, wants to lead you deeper,

887
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 wants to know you more.

888
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Do you want it for yourself?

889
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 We've got a team down front that would love to pray with you,

890
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 process with you.

891
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Some of you need to come down and pray with somebody.

892
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 I'm just gonna say it.

893
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 If you come forward,

894
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 you will never tell us something that would ever surprise us.

895
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 We would love to pray with you.

896
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 We would love to process whatever it is God is doing in this space.

897
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Let's sing together.

898
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,360
