[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.240]   - You have seven unheard messages.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.920]   - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.960]   I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.440]   - Hey, yo, Danny!
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.120]   Where are you at, bro?
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.920]   I'll see you soon, all right?
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.040]   - Hey, so I have moved on,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.400]   but I feel like the Lord keeps putting you back
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   on my heart for a reason, so please call me back.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.680]   - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.000]   but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market now.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.480]   She's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.920]   So hit me back, love you, bro.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.680]   - No, I'm sure this is the right number,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.600]   but last night was a mistake.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.520]   I was just hoping we could keep that between us.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.720]   - Hey, just wanted to say,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520]   I don't think I can make it tonight.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.300]   and we need to talk.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.480]   (phone ringing)
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.920]   - All right, Porsche, how we doing tonight?
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.600]   You doing okay?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680]   It's great to see you.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.560]   Welcome back.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.040]   If it's a return trip to you here,
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.400]   we're so grateful that you would be in the room.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.200]   If this is your very first time at the Porsche,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.160]   we're so glad that you are in the room.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.640]   This summer has been wild.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.120]   It's gotten rowdy in this room at times,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.280]   and we're grateful that you would turn up
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.420]   and be a part of it.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.840]   God's not just doing something awesome here.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080]   He's doing something great all over the place.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.680]   He is moving in cities just like ours all across the nation.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.120]   Particularly, we want to shout out
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.360]   some of our Porsche Live locations.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   Porsche Live, Greater Lafayette, Fresno, and Scottsdale.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   Hey, before we jump in, I do want to ask,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.200]   if you haven't noticed, it's pretty packed in here.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.700]   We've got people that are still trying to find seats
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.860]   outside in the town center and in our overflow.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.360]   And so if you could, if there are seats available to you,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.640]   left or right, would you move into those seats?
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.120]   Could we all squeeze in a little bit,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.180]   get cozy with the people to your left and to your right?
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.520]   Maybe you'll meet someone this evening, maybe you won't.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.240]   I'm not sure, but this could be a good opportunity
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.480]   to see if it's possible and make some room
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.880]   for some of our friends.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.360]   That's awesome, thank you so much.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.120]   Well, hey, tonight we are continuing the conversation
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.040]   that we started last week in answering the question,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.840]   is dating supposed to be this hard?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.400]   It's a question that many of you are confronted with.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.640]   And so we wanted to step right into it
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.520]   and answer it with what God has to say.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.880]   To set up the idea, I remember asking myself that question
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.960]   when I first had my initial interaction with love,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.560]   I was but 12 years old.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.620]   And at that time I asked out a girl
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.400]   for the very first time in my young life.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.800]   You see, the annual homecoming football game was coming up
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.880]   and everybody was taking a date.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.900]   And so not wanting to be left out
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.560]   or look different than everybody else,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.200]   I had my eye on my grade school crush
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.600]   and I knew this was the perfect moment for me to ask her
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.720]   if she wanted to go with me.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840]   And so not having been in this position before,
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.760]   I asked some of my buddies,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.920]   hey, you guys have done it, like help me out.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.280]   And so gleaning all the 12 year old wisdom I could get,
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.960]   what I learned in that moment is they would stand
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.800]   across the hall in the middle of passing period,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.160]   they would signal to me whenever she came out of her class.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.760]   And then all I had to do was walk up and just simply say,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.880]   hey, do you wanna go to homecoming with me?
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.120]   And so we assumed our positions.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.400]   The bell rang, people exit their classes,
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.360]   they begin going to their next place.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360]   And right at the time they give me the signal, go for it,
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.320]   man, and I like move from where I am.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.080]   And I turned the corner to coincidentally bump into her
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.360]   and we make contact.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.440]   And I look at her and I say,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   hey, do you wanna go to the homecoming football game with me?
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.680]   To which she responded, I'm sorry, who are you?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   Again, I was but just a youth,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.640]   but I remember even thinking at that time,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.240]   this is so much harder than I thought.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.560]   Like no one had told me how to approach a girl
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.640]   or how to keep the stakes low
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.360]   or how to not come on too strong
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680]   or how to express my feelings.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   And in the same way, so many of us have been unlearned
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.520]   in the language and lessons of love
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.840]   because no one's ever told us.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.320]   The way that we've learned instead is by trial and error.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.280]   Amen, anybody?
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.720]   Trial and error, after error and after error
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.400]   and after error and after error.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.200]   You see, you have found yourself
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.600]   kind of risking the rejection
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.320]   of whether or not they'll leave you on read or not.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.040]   You've seen within yourself this awkward burden
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   of having to go into another first date
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.080]   and potentially bear the consequence
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.760]   of another uncomfortable conversation.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.520]   You've had to guess their intent
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.880]   because though they're flirtatious,
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.160]   they've never actually clarified their feelings for you.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.200]   You don't know if you're best friends
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.880]   or if you're soon to be lovers.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   You have no idea.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.400]   This is the landscape of love that you're a part of.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.120]   It is confusing.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   You see, for so many of us, you've looked at dating
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.560]   and found it to be less blissful than you hoped
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.280]   and more painful than you expected.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.000]   And there's a good reason for that.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.400]   Your generation is facing the most complicated
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.480]   dating dynamic in the history of the world.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.680]   You're welcome.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.320]   You did not ask for it, but it is the hand you've been dealt.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   You see, you live amongst a moment
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.080]   where you have to learn not just dating etiquette,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.640]   but online dating etiquette.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.680]   There are shifting gender roles.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.680]   There's an ever evolving relationship structure at play.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.200]   And then we live in an ever increasing
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.220]   individualistic society where people are fine
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.760]   if they don't find love.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.360]   You see, according to Dr. Michael Rosenfeld,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.220]   professor of sociology at Stanford,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.120]   talking about the considerable impact
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.600]   our modern dating moment has had in the lives of people,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.400]   he says, "There are 10 million more single Americans
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.040]   "right now than at any other given moment in history."
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.080]   10 million.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.600]   And most of them are under the age of 35,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.400]   which makes sense when you think about it.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.500]   That might feel shocking, but if you look at the data,
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.400]   it's not surprising because we've seen
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.480]   the average age of first marriage has steadily increased
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.940]   over the last several years.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.480]   We know that women are on average marrying at 28,
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.760]   guys are on average marrying at the age of 30,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.920]   but it's not just that people are waiting longer to marry,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.320]   it's also that divorce rates are skyrocketing
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.360]   amongst people that are in their 20s and 30s specifically.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.640]   You see, we're living in a moment
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.560]   that the experts are calling a romantic recession,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.000]   that love is on the lam,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.800]   despite the fact that young people just like yourself
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.440]   overwhelmingly identify as wanting to be
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.040]   in a committed relationship.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.720]   So many even go into the point of anticipating
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.880]   tying the knot at some point in the future.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.680]   So how can both of these things be true at the same time?
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.240]   How is it that romance can be on the decline
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.400]   and yet everybody wants to find love anyways?
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.000]   I'll tell you how it's possible.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.600]   We're not very good at dating.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.500]   That's the synopsis.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.880]   That's how we make sense of those two realities.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.560]   We do not know what we're doing,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.120]   so much so that there is an entire television segment
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.480]   committed to this reality.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.440]   Like if you've ever watched "Bachelor in Paradise"
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.040]   or "Love Island" or "Love is Blind,"
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.500]   what is the basic premise of those shows?
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.120]   The premise is this.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.840]   They get together a group of people
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.120]   that deeply want to find love,
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   but are horrible at finding it.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.480]   You see, you see within those shows,
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.120]   a group of people that they're waiting for a hotter option
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.080]   to walk down the beach.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.300]   They're playing a mind game
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.960]   so that way they don't get voted off in some way.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.000]   They're trying to hook up with someone,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.240]   yet not learn their last name
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.320]   because they don't want to get too committed too soon.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.820]   You see, they have no idea what they're doing.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.120]   And we watch them for it.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.960]   You're not watching
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.160]   because you're anticipating the moment they find love.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.000]   You're watching them
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.960]   because you're anticipating the moment they don't.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   And they spiral into an emotional dumpster fire of disaster.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.400]   Like that's what you're waiting for.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   You want the drama.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.880]   That's why we watch these shows.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.360]   And yet while it's easy for us
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.480]   in the comfort of our seats to point the finger and laugh,
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.320]   look at those people.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.680]   They have no idea what they're doing.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.640]   The truth of the matter is,
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.880]   we don't know what we're doing either.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.020]   This moment is a difficult moment.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.680]   We make dating harder than it has to be.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.760]   And so here's my hope.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.200]   My hope is to make it easy or easier
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.740]   over the course of our evening.
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.080]   You see, I want to tell you the do's and the don'ts of dating
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.520]   because when you follow them,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.180]   these principles that God has given us,
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.220]   the entire process, it gets so much easier.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.660]   And these principles,
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.980]   they're not just some rules for you to know.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.580]   That way you can enter them like a cheat code
[00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.620]   and out pops a spouse at the end of it.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.500]   You see, a lot of dating damage has been done
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.380]   in the name of a Christian formula
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.280]   where X plus Y equals soulmate.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.500]   That's not my hope.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.980]   I'm not trying to give you a scientific method.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.460]   Dating is not science.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.780]   Dating is art.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.560]   Yes, there are colors you must use,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.320]   but you must also learn from the master artist himself.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.740]   You must listen to God
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.700]   for he has built these principles
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.940]   to point to a greater picture,
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.340]   a picture of the love that he has for his people.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.340]   And so without further ado,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.860]   we're going to get into these principles.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.660]   Last week, we went through four of them.
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:43.380]   I do not have time to unpack those four.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.380]   If you're interested, they're on the screen behind me.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.480]   You can also go and watch the message
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.500]   or listen to the audio,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.620]   but I just want to dive straight into the fifth principle
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.680]   that you need if you want to make your dating easier.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.220]   So here it is, the fifth principle that you need.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.800]   Don't be isolated.
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.020]   Do be inclusive.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.040]   Don't be isolated, but be inclusive.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.260]   You see, dating is not a static state of commitment.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.060]   It is a dynamic process of assessment,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.920]   but too often we perform that assessment all by ourself.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.060]   So last year, I bought a 1991 Ford F-150,
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.700]   which is a dream to me,
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.580]   but the reality is I didn't know anything
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.700]   about 35-year-old vehicles.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.060]   And so to help me in the purchasing process,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.620]   I made sure to schedule an appointment with a mechanic.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.440]   Like it wasn't enough for me to just walk up,
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.420]   pop the hood, and take a look and say,
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.460]   "Yeah, this thing looks great."
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.540]   No, I knew that I needed professional help.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.700]   And so I took the truck to this mechanic
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.980]   and he didn't just pop the hood and look at it
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.820]   and say, "Yeah, man, it looks great."
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.620]   Instead, he took that truck and he put it on a lift
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.060]   and he raised it to the sky
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.540]   so that we could walk underneath it
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.100]   and we can inspect every square inch of the thing
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.020]   because he wanted to help me
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.740]   know that it was worthy of purchasing,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.660]   that the value was present.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.940]   You see, I needed someone else's help
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.900]   to make a good decision.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.820]   And yet so many of us, we settle in the world of dating
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.660]   for making the assessment on our own.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.420]   Well, he passes the eye test for me.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.500]   Have you seen those arms?
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.340]   That looks good.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.500]   You know, like that's often the way that we process
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.140]   whether or not we're going to get in a relationship
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.380]   with someone or not.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.740]   And yet that's not the Bible's recommendation.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.220]   The Bible says in Proverbs 11, 14,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.380]   "Where there is no guidance, a people falls,
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.340]   but in an abundance of counselors, there is safety."
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.740]   In Proverbs 15, 22, "Without counsel, plans fail,
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.620]   but with many advisors, they succeed."
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.620]   You see, isolation makes for poor evaluation.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.820]   Isolation makes for poor evaluation.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.940]   There's a reason we say, "You're lost in your fields."
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.700]   What are we communicating when we say that?
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.580]   We're saying, "You're crushing so hard
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.580]   that you're just seeing what you want to see,
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.740]   but your friends will see what you need to see."
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.540]   You see, some of you, you're in a relationship
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.180]   where your community has raised a red flag
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.780]   because, man, he is sketchy.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.180]   Like he never shows up when he says he's going to show up.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.060]   He is never arriving when he says he's going to arrive.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.900]   Or they've looked at you and said,
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.100]   "Man, she's pretty controlling.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.100]   Like, have you thought about that?
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.940]   It seems like she always wants to know where you are
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.820]   and what you're doing."
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.380]   They have raised red flags.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.980]   And yet too often we look at them and go,
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.460]   "But you don't know him or her the way that I do."
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:30.420]   Listen, it is difficult to see red flags
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.580]   when you have on rose-colored glasses.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.940]   You need help.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:40.100]   You need people to speak the truth to you in love.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.300]   In the medieval ages,
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.420]   the Anglican church liturgized the phrase,
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.580]   "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.220]   And the reason they did
[00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.060]   is they were trying to provide protection
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.900]   from people within their community
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.820]   being forcefully coerced into an unwanted marriage.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.140]   It was a method for their community to protect their own.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.220]   And a similar premise must be true in our day.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.740]   You see, the more community you include,
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.540]   the more safety you invite.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.100]   The more community you include, the more safety you invite.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.620]   So when Brooke and I, my wife, started dating in college,
[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.540]   I remember my best friend at the time
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.380]   coming to me and saying,
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.660]   "Hey man, I'd love to tag along."
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.500]   On a date?
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.340]   Yes, on a date.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.260]   As a third wheel?
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.620]   Sure, as a third wheel.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.260]   Why did he wanna go on a date with us?
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.540]   Not because he wanted to see Frozen.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.700]   He came on that date with us
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.980]   because he wanted to get to know Brooke.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.340]   He wanted to see the two of us interact.
[00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.700]   He wanted to know, man, is it easy for y'all
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.740]   when you're together?
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.740]   Does she fit the form of the kind of godly woman
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.860]   that you've told me you want?
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.820]   Is there strife, conflict early in your relationship?
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.420]   Do y'all move through things pretty naturally?
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.340]   He wanted to evaluate her for my benefit.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.300]   And it's a testament to my bride.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.140]   She was delighted to have him come.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.060]   She was so eager to meet somebody from my world,
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.180]   see someone that had a massive voice
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.420]   and influence in my life.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.700]   She wanted to become familiar with the people
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.500]   that I was a part of.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.780]   You see, when Brooke and I were dating,
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.540]   we wanted godly people to watch us
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.340]   and help us because we needed to be watched
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.500]   and we needed to be helped.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.980]   We dated not just in the context of community,
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.700]   but inclusive of our community.
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:33.060]   It wasn't just that we were content having people around.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.900]   No, we wanted people to be involved.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.620]   There's a major difference in those things.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.180]   You see, if you're in a relationship with someone
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.940]   that's trying to isolate you from your friends
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.460]   or your family, or they get annoyed
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.900]   whenever you spend time with your community,
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.260]   or they always wanna do things with you in private,
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.180]   they're diametrically opposed to ever going out in public,
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.260]   then you need to get away from that person.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.020]   God saved us into community.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.860]   His people see the value of it.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.140]   And we do not try to isolate ourselves away
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.700]   from that which God has saved us into.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.780]   You need this.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.020]   You need a community.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.380]   And not just a community that consists of good friends.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.940]   Hear me, you need a community that consists of godly guides.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.500]   What's the difference in those two things?
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.980]   Friends make for good company,
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.660]   but guides give good direction.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.020]   You need people in your life
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.340]   that will not simply tell you what you wanna hear,
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.980]   but will tell you what you need to hear.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.580]   You need people that are really two things,
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.100]   people that are wise and loving,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.540]   like they're wise enough to know what you need
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.140]   and they are loving enough to tell you what you need.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.340]   I'm a firm believer in this.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.460]   I'll step away from the book.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.020]   This is just my personal recommendation.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.660]   I think that you should imbue people within your community
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.300]   that are identified as wise and loving
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.540]   with not only a voice in your relationship,
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.420]   but a vote in your relationship.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.220]   So if they look at you and the majority of them say,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.820]   "This thing looks toxic," then you end it.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.300]   If the majority of them say,
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.660]   "Man, we think you should go out with this person,"
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.380]   then you should go on at least one date with that person.
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.220]   Why?
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.340]   Because these are people that they are wise in God's word,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.460]   they love your heart,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.840]   and you can trust them with your relationship.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.740]   The second thing that you need in godly guides
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.740]   is you need people that have walked with God longer than you.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.900]   There's a saying,
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.180]   "The best teacher isn't personal experience,
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.060]   "it's someone else's."
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.140]   And I agree with that.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.860]   I think that saying is spot on.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.980]   And the apostle Paul says he agrees as well.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.340]   In Titus 2, he gives specific instruction
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.940]   to older men and women
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.380]   about investing in the lives of younger men and women.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.780]   But Kylan, I don't know any older men.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.400]   Then find some.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.380]   They're not hard to point out.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.820]   They're pretty obvious by way of their appearance.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.820]   It's not difficult to see people that are older than you.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.100]   I remember when I was in college,
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.260]   I wanted, I was absent anybody in my life
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.780]   that was older and wiser than myself.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.300]   Everyone was my age.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.420]   It was the blind leading the blind.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.540]   So I wanted someone to speak into my world.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.660]   And so what I did is I remember going to church
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.600]   and seeing a guy who I did not know personally,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.620]   but he had an amazing reputation.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.800]   And I admired him from afar.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.140]   I admired the way he loved his wife
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.500]   and he treated his kids and he served in his church
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.300]   and he somehow all at the same time led within his company.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.020]   This was the kind of guy that I wanted to learn from.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.860]   And so I went up to him and you know what I said?
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.260]   I admire you for these following reasons.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.020]   Can I take you to lunch and ask you some questions?
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.060]   He said, yes.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:48.900]   Why?
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.020]   Because godly guides are looking for people
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.440]   to give guidance to.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.540]   So this is not hard.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.040]   If you wanna know what to do,
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:04.140]   ask humbly, buy them lunch,
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.820]   prep questions, listen more than you speak
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.060]   and then thank them for their time.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.380]   Don't walk in and load them down with,
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.860]   hey, will you be my mentor?
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:18.340]   I don't recommend you do that in a dating relationship.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.860]   Will you be my wife?
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.280]   That's not gonna go well either.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.140]   It's synonymous in terms of its intensity.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.100]   Don't do that.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.180]   Walk up and say, hey, I would love to get time with you.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.100]   Would you be open for that?
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.260]   Here's the following reasons.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.220]   I'll buy lunch, I'll prep questions.
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.300]   I will make sure to listen and take notes
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.900]   and then I will be so grateful for the hour you carve.
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.460]   That's what you have to do.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.060]   Dating is hard when you do it alone,
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.860]   but you're not meant to.
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.340]   That's not God's design.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.560]   And the beauty of it is that community actually teaches us
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.980]   how we're supposed to treat our partner,
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.080]   which brings us to our sixth principle.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.420]   Don't be critical.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.980]   Do be kind.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.180]   Don't be critical, but be kind.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.220]   Proverbs 19, 22a, ladies, this is what you want.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.220]   What is desirable in a man is his kindness, his kindness,
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.340]   which feels obvious.
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.940]   Yes, yes, I know, Kylan,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.420]   I'm supposed to like the nice guys.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.740]   I need to give them a shot.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.500]   This is so much bigger than that.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.940]   I'm not just trying to tell you to find a Hallmark hubby
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.180]   that you can take home for the holidays
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.020]   and make your parents happy.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.220]   That's not what this is about
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.900]   because that's not what the Bible's communicating.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.020]   The Bible is teaching something so much more serious
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.020]   in this moment.
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.780]   You see, in the New Testament,
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.820]   the authors of every New Testament letter,
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.900]   they combine to pull together 50 plus one another statements
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.000]   and those statements tell us
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.700]   how we're meant to treat one another.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.420]   Why are there 50 plus?
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.280]   Because it's not so obvious how we should treat one another.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.300]   We're not very good at it.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.280]   And so what we see is they unpack 50 plus
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.120]   one another statements.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.080]   And while we don't have time to walk through all 50 plus,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.900]   what we can do is we can break them down
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.220]   into the buckets they belong
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.740]   because those 50 plus statements
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.860]   belong in four different categories.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.500]   So that way you understand what kindness looks like
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.900]   as it's expressed in your dating relationship.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.380]   The first thing is that kindness is peaceable.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.420]   Kindness is peaceable.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.260]   You see, more than one third of the one another statements
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.780]   are about pursuing peace and maintaining unity.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.060]   Second Corinthians 13 11 by the apostle Paul says,
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.560]   "Finally, brothers, rejoice, aim for restoration,
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.860]   comfort one another, agree with one another,
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.040]   live in peace and the God of love and peace
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.520]   will be with you."
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.980]   Ephesians 4 1 and 3 says,
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.480]   "I, therefore a prisoner for the Lord,
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.800]   urge you walk in a manner worthy of the calling
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.260]   to which you've been called."
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.140]   How do I do that?
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.360]   "With all humility and gentleness,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.820]   with patience, bearing with one another in love,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.800]   eager to maintain the unity of the spirit
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.500]   in the bond of peace."
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.700]   What are these passages saying?
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.280]   You are going to face conflict in life
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.800]   and you're gonna face conflict in dating.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.880]   It's coming for you.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.520]   When you are in close emotional proximity to another person,
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.280]   they are gonna say something that gets on your nerves.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.160]   They're gonna do something
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.000]   that you can't even begin to explain.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.420]   They're going to forget something that drives you nuts.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.140]   And then how they respond whenever that conflict comes,
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.400]   it tells you a lot about their character,
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.500]   which is what you're trying to figure out.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:37.460]   Guys, women are sophisticated by design and you are not.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.240]   And so you're going to mess up
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.960]   and you're not even going to understand why.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.840]   You're not even gonna know what you did.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.520]   And yet in that moment,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.720]   the right response is not to get defensive,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.440]   but I didn't mean to hurt her feelings,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.480]   but you did hurt her feelings.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.880]   And so you need to understand what did I do
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.280]   that resulted in your feelings being hurt?
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.080]   Because I don't want that to happen anymore.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.280]   And so here's what you do.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.760]   She's gonna use her words
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.200]   and you're gonna use your ears
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   and you're gonna listen closely
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.280]   and then you're gonna own as much of it as you can.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.760]   I tell couples whenever I perform their wedding ceremonies,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.360]   "Hey, marriage is not 50/50, it is 100/100.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.840]   I am not approaching you today saying,
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.200]   I'm gonna give you my half so long as you give me yours.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.760]   No, I'm 7'4" and I'm giving you the whole 100.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.440]   I'm giving you everything I have.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.320]   Everything I offer you today
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.760]   is not conditioned upon what you do at all."
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.240]   Men, that's how you approach your woman in conflict.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.160]   Ladies, they don't know what you're thinking.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.280]   So when you think, "He would if he wanted,"
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.660]   he doesn't even know what you might possibly want of him.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.820]   And so what you must do is you must seek to understand.
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.960]   You must use small words.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.980]   And then you need to be committed to re-explaining yourself
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.120]   'cause he's going to need you to do it.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.340]   Hear me, if you have the right man,
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.680]   he is not just willing to improve, he's wanting to improve.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.940]   That's the right man, he wants to.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.260]   And so when you come to him and if you have some beef,
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.300]   some issue with what he's done, don't accuse his character.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.660]   Well, you just never care about me.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.820]   Oh my, you're just not full of grace.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.420]   I'm always seeking peace with you,
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.620]   but you're never seeking peace with me.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.460]   Don't do that.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.260]   Don't make an accusation against his character.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.980]   Make an observation about his behavior.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.100]   What did he do that made you feel this way?
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:54.100]   Because he can address that, he can fix his behavior.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.360]   Don't write him off before you even give him the chance.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.580]   If you want to be with someone that is peaceable,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.700]   then you're looking for someone that is humble enough
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.140]   to admit they're wrong.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.100]   And catch me, they're humble enough to admit they're wrong,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.520]   not because they love you, but because they love Jesus
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.660]   and they don't want to grieve his heart.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.980]   That's what you want.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.980]   That's what someone who's peaceable looks like.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.820]   The second category for kindness is kindness is considerate.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.660]   It's considerate.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.140]   This makes up another third of the one another statements
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.020]   that we get in the New Testament.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.500]   John 13, 34 says, "A new commandment I give to you
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.340]   that you love one another, just as I've loved you,
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.900]   so also are you to love one another."
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.940]   First Peter 4, 8, "Above all,
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.940]   keep loving one another earnestly,
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.860]   since love covers a multitude of sins."
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.140]   That's the kind of person you want to date.
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.340]   You want to date someone that is considerate
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:42.780]   of what it looks like to love you,
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.220]   which absolutely rails against the standards of today.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.020]   We live in a moment right now
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.620]   where people want to keep their options open,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.580]   where they'll string each other along,
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.540]   where they're adopting open forms of relationship
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.020]   because then they are not having
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.940]   to make any kind of commitment.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.500]   We live in a commitment-averse culture.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.020]   And yet what we hear from this
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.060]   is that is not considered of someone else,
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.100]   it is considered of themself.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.980]   You don't want to be with someone like that.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.080]   You don't want someone that considers themself.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   You want someone that is carefully considering you instead.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.300]   This may sound really silly.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.860]   When Brooke and I first started dating,
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.900]   I made a commitment that I was not going to like
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.500]   another girl's photo on Instagram the entire time,
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:21.900]   which feels crazy.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.820]   You're like, "Did she put you up to that?"
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.140]   No, I chose to do that.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:27.960]   Why?
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.900]   Because I didn't want to run the risk
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.300]   of her seeing my name like in some other girl's picture.
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.140]   That's dumb.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.100]   That's not worth it.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:36.980]   Even if we're friends,
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.340]   and there's a totally plausible reason for why I would do it,
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.220]   I'm not willing to risk my relationship with her.
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.500]   I want to make sure everything I do
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.060]   is in consideration of her.
[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.340]   I wanted to prove you don't need to worry about me,
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.300]   where my eyes are going, who it is I'm liking,
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.700]   who I might be texting on the side.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.900]   You never have to worry about me
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.460]   'cause I'm considerate of you.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.860]   If your boyfriend or girlfriend,
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.060]   if they start acting all weird
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.380]   when you grab their phone from them,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.260]   or if they can't seem to commit to your plans
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.700]   for the weekend because you're with your family
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.180]   and they don't really love being around them,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.180]   or if they're vague about what their weekend events
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.940]   look like with the boys or the girls,
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.340]   then that's a cause for concern.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.180]   That's not a sign of consideration.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:20.620]   You see, we're looking for someone who looks like Christ.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.740]   What does Christ look like?
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.740]   He was considerate of you at great cost to himself,
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.540]   even to the point of death on the cross.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.180]   Third category, we gotta go.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.320]   Kindness is encouraging.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.160]   It's encouraging.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.980]   This comprises about 18 to 20% of the statements.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.740]   Hebrews 10, 24, 25 says, "And let us consider,"
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.580]   there's that word,
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.300]   "how to stir one another up to love and good works,
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.660]   not neglecting to meet together,
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.820]   as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.280]   and all the more as you see the day drawing near."
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.120]   You see, to encourage literally means
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.780]   to put courage into another person.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.140]   You don't want a relationship that tears you down.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.820]   You want a relationship that builds you up.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.340]   And that sounds really nice.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.740]   And yet, listen to me,
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.080]   if he is questioning something about you
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.860]   that is outside the realm of your power to control,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:12.100]   he's not building you up, he's tearing you down.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.460]   So if he gets onto you about your physical appearance,
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.660]   or he's talking bad about your personality,
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.180]   or whatever it may be,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.020]   that's not someone that's wanting to encourage you.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.180]   That's someone that's wanting to invalidate you.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.580]   If she is constantly comparing you
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.380]   to all of her boyfriends, all of her girlfriends,
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.820]   boyfriends, then that's not someone
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.020]   you wanna be compared to.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.140]   You don't necessarily want to link up
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.360]   with someone that makes a big deal
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.100]   out of a really small deal.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:45.100]   If you're perpetually in trouble over senseless things,
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.840]   then you should be concerned.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.740]   You want someone that is encouraging.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.480]   Proverbs 21, nine says,
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.760]   "It is better to live in a corner of the housetop
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.080]   than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife."
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.880]   AKA, if you're around a nagging Nancy,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.380]   it's like being waterboarded.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.280]   You don't want that.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.920]   Your relationship should be marked by encouragement.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.760]   It should put courage into you.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.540]   Courage into you to not just be a good boyfriend
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.280]   or girlfriend, but courage into you to be
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.780]   all that God has made you to be.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.980]   To live into the body, live into the personality,
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.640]   live into the design that he has perfectly imbued you with.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.760]   That's what he wants.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.640]   And then the fourth category is kindness is humble.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.140]   That's like the last 15% or so.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.660]   Galatians 5, 13 says,
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.240]   "For you were called to freedom, brothers.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.220]   Only don't use your freedom as an opportunity
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.220]   for the flesh, but through love, serve one another."
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.940]   Philippians 2, three through four says,
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.540]   "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit,
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.420]   but in humility count others more significant than yourself.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.340]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests,
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.340]   but also to the interests of others."
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.560]   See, put simply, your relationship should be marked
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.840]   by humility.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.600]   But where do I find that kind of person, Kylan?
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.840]   Like how do I know if they're actually humble
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.400]   or if they're just making a really good first impression?
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.640]   That's a great question to ask
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   because they should be putting their best foot forward.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   Do you wanna know where you can look
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.680]   for a genuinely humble person?
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.000]   You look for them where they're not solely humble for you.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.120]   They are humble without you.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.800]   You look for them in places where they serve.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.160]   That's why I tell people, it's not the reason you should,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.560]   but if you begin to serve,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.640]   that's a good place to look for her or him.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.720]   I remember when I worked in college ministry,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.720]   we had team leaders,
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.260]   the very best of the volunteers that we had
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:40.360]   that always seemed to crush on one another,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.560]   even though they weren't supposed to.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.840]   And the reason why they would crush on one another
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.400]   is because they looked at each other
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.680]   and they saw you are giving so much of yourself
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.960]   for the benefit of other people, and that is attractive.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.980]   I remember when Brooke and I first met,
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.520]   this is what she was doing
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.260]   amongst a group of people in our business organization.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.380]   She was playing volleyball.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.480]   We were all playing volleyball
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.640]   and she was showing up to play 'cause she's competitive,
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.480]   but she was also showing up because she's kind.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.920]   And she wanted to get to know people.
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.400]   She wanted to ask them their stories.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.800]   She wanted to make a personal investment.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.440]   She didn't want or she didn't need anything from them,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.840]   validation, approval, but she wanted everything for them.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.320]   She wanted them to know Jesus.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   And I sat there and I watched that,
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.400]   and that was so attractive.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.640]   It was driving me crazy, girl.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.720]   I need to spend time with you.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.800]   Like that was the reaction
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.920]   as I saw her being humble to other people.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.540]   You see, listen, humility is hot.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.900]   It is, it looks good on people.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.180]   And so you should think about looking for it
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.980]   in him or her yourself.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.820]   You want someone humble.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.420]   You want someone, catch me,
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.100]   that observably lives for the benefit of other people
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:51.740]   because Christ observably died for the benefit of you.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.540]   That's what you want.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.180]   That's what true humility looks like.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.640]   I will give of myself for the benefit of another,
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.560]   which brings us to our seventh principle.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.840]   Don't be naive.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.820]   Do be vigilant.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.960]   You be vigilant.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.640]   We're gonna give an entire talk
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.160]   committed to this specific topic,
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.760]   what sex looks like in the lives of young adults.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.640]   And so I'm gonna resist the temptation
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.980]   to share more right now than I should,
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.180]   but we do need to answer the question as we consider,
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.680]   I mean, what does it look like for us
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.520]   to navigate dating in an easier way?
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.400]   We have to evaluate what does it look like
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.740]   for purity to be in play?
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.520]   The Bible has a lot to say about this.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.560]   Just a couple of verses.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.240]   Proverbs 6.32, he who commits adultery lacks sense.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.620]   He who does it destroys himself.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.900]   First Corinthians 6.18 says, flee from sexual immorality.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.500]   Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.860]   but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.180]   You see, sexual compromise outside of God's design
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:03.180]   is dangerous, and that's because sex is so powerful.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.180]   You see, when you have sex with another person,
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.980]   your brain releases dopamine,
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.740]   which activates the reward system of your brain,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.860]   and it also releases oxytocin,
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.060]   which is the love hormone, as people know it for,
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.020]   which is especially powerful when it comes to mate bonding.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.500]   What happens when you have sex with another person
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.100]   is you are growing attached to them,
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.620]   not just in a casual way, in a chemical way.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.260]   And as you do it in greater and greater degrees
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.020]   of frequency, that attachment becomes addiction.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.080]   What a beautiful gift from God
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.540]   when within the confines of his design,
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.560]   a loving marriage between two people
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.500]   where there is total safety,
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.260]   that that bond will never be broken,
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.300]   and so we can pour gas on the fire.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.280]   But when we take it outside of its intended place,
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.480]   it can become disastrous.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.460]   Because when you break up with someone,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.100]   you not only lose your partner,
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.480]   you lose a part of yourself.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.180]   Sex is so powerful.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.460]   It is so good.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:23.420]   Like, it's something worth waiting for.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.100]   It's something worth valuing,
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:32.020]   in the same way that Aladdin in the Cave of Wonders
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:36.060]   had to resist every other temptation and jewel
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.420]   and have only eyes for the lamp.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.120]   So you are meant to move through your relationship
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.880]   with eyes for that which is most prized of all, purity.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   I know that sounds so Christian-y,
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.300]   and yet it's so good.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.100]   God is trying to save you from something
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:59.100]   that can irreparably hurt you in the wrong context.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.800]   And so we must agree with what Paul says
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.020]   in the Book of Romans.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.060]   We should not make provision for the flesh
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.540]   to gratify its desires,
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.100]   meaning we don't invite unnecessary temptation
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.940]   into our life.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.100]   Like, you don't go into her room.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.500]   You don't stay at his apartment.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.660]   You definitely don't turn the lights down low,
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.140]   wait past 11 p.m. 'cause nothing good happens then.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.020]   Don't you dare turn on the R&B,
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.220]   because you know those things are gonna put you
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.060]   in a position where you're ultimately tempted
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.940]   beyond your capacity.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.480]   You set your boundaries early.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.660]   You honor them always.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:41.660]   And you frequently revisit them.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.340]   I think I've said this before,
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   possibly in an equipping night,
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.520]   but I will charge my son with this.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:55.020]   Nothing below the chin, nothing horizontal,
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.580]   nothing in the dark,
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.460]   and nothing lasts longer than five seconds.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.500]   You obey these rules from me, my son,
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.140]   and you will be safe.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.780]   Those are good boundaries if you're looking for some.
[00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:11.380]   Proverbs 25, 28 says, "A man without self-control
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.980]   "is like a city broken into and left without walls."
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.720]   Would you move into a city that's been pillaged
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.580]   of all its resources, plundered and left in ruin?
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.100]   Would you do that?
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.900]   Then why are you moving in with somebody,
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.900]   some guy, some girl, that does not have self-control either?
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.140]   Like, if your boyfriend is convinced you
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.060]   that he just needs a sexual outlet,
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.700]   what you need to be convinced of is he needs self-control.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.820]   Like, if he's pushing you to send him nudes,
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:44.940]   if he's constantly pushing the boundaries
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:49.660]   of the parameters that y'all have concocted together,
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.180]   if he's constantly guilting you
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.700]   because you just won't help him,
[00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.060]   then listen, you're not the one who needs help.
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.880]   He is the one that needs help.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.880]   Jesus was single and sinless his entire life.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.060]   And so if Jesus can do that for 33 years of his life,
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.340]   your man can do that
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.340]   until he either chooses to propose to you
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.780]   or he chooses to move on.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.380]   And if he doesn't do either of those,
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.420]   then you need to probably move on.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:21.340]   You want a man that's not mastered by his flesh.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.460]   You want a man that has mastered his flesh.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.660]   You want someone that for the sake of honoring God
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.060]   and honoring you will go to war against that
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.340]   which wants to destroy the very ones he loves.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.200]   That's what you want.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.500]   Now for fear of the ladies
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.620]   thinking they're getting off the hook,
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.660]   let me speak to you for a moment.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.700]   In the book of Proverbs,
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.460]   we meet a character by the title of the adulterous woman.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.100]   And what you know is that there are three primary
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.900]   descriptors of this lady.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.460]   She has smooth speech,
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.500]   a seductive appearance,
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.860]   and a cold conscience.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.540]   And so ladies, you be careful
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.080]   in the way that you speak to men.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.060]   You be considerate of it.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.520]   Don't sex them just because it makes you feel secure.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.020]   It's nice to be liked.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.400]   You actually feel wanted.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.680]   Don't do that.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.280]   Don't flirt with them just because,
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.180]   man, I like having someone on the hook.
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.840]   It gives me some sense of validation.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.060]   You be careful with the way you speak.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.960]   So much has said about modesty in the church
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.280]   and that you need to be careful how you dress.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.440]   I am blown away by the things
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.560]   that I see girls wear in the gym.
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.800]   Not just because that can't be possibly comfortable
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.040]   to lift in, but because it's so sad.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.660]   It's a living testament to the fact
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.340]   that they want the affirmation and approval of a man
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.760]   when they have a God that wants to give them
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.500]   affirmation and approval already.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.720]   The curves of your body are not meant for us.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.500]   They are meant for your husband.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.980]   So save them for him.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.160]   And lastly,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.800]   if you're here and you're prone to preying on innocent men
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.660]   because there's something empowering about showing them
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.060]   the sexual ropes as opposed to always being shown yourself,
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.600]   then you be careful because that is the fast road
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.400]   to deadening your conscience before God.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.280]   Don't do that.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.480]   Now, as I say all of this,
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.400]   here's what I know happens in the room.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.000]   Like I can feel the cloud of guilt
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.400]   that hangs over some of you
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.920]   because you've done some of this.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.640]   You've done worse than this.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.020]   Let me just say, not as a preacher at the porch,
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.740]   but hopefully a pastor to you,
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.320]   I have done things too.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.580]   We do not regard people in light of what they've done.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:59.060]   We regard people in light of how far they've come.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.200]   That's what it means to have the grace of Jesus for someone.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.080]   And so if you're here and you're like, man,
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.240]   when they learn what I've done,
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.560]   when they see the places I've been,
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.800]   when I have to unpack my body count at some point,
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.040]   they're gonna run out.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.980]   If they run out, then good riddance to them.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:19.040]   They don't know the love of God.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.540]   They don't know the grace of Jesus,
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.960]   which extends to the very worst of you.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.860]   You're not too far gone.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.440]   Christ, he looks at the adulterous woman and he says,
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.960]   has no one condemned you?
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.080]   Then do not condemn yourself
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.240]   for what I have not condemned you of.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.000]   He says you're free.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.400]   He denied himself so that you might be beloved.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.320]   And now you get to deny yourself from this day forward
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.960]   for the sake of your beloved.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.880]   And then the last principle I'll give you
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.920]   is don't be reckless.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.200]   Do be respectful.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.340]   Romans 12.10 says, love one another with brotherly affection
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.860]   which can also be interpreted as respect.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.340]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.540]   Matthew 7.12 says, so whatever you wish
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.100]   that others would do to you, do also to them
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.000]   for this is the law and the prophets.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.980]   I'll be quick because I know that we're coming
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.420]   to the end of this thing.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.460]   When I was preparing this message,
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.200]   I found it so fascinating.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.700]   I was doing a little bit of research on toxic relationships
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.940]   and what I found is that all toxic relationships
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.180]   early in their existence share the same primary indicator.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.480]   You wanna know what it is?
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:38.860]   A lack of respect between one or both parties.
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.540]   You see, most if not all unhealthy relationships,
[00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:43.780]   they are formed under the failure
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:47.080]   of recognizing the other person's value.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.600]   And every person has value
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.540]   because they have been made in God's image.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.340]   They have a God-given dignity.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.260]   And so in relationship, we should recognize that
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.540]   and treat one another in kind.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.940]   You see, in unhealthy relationships,
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.780]   instead of being marked by mutual admiration
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.540]   for one another, what you often see
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:10.420]   is a gradual manipulation of the other
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.060]   where one person uses the other
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.760]   to get from them what they want.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.660]   I was thinking about this as I stood over there
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.220]   before coming on the stage, looking at this room
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.180]   and reeling with the statistics
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.580]   that one in four girls before the age of 18
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.380]   and one in six guys before the age of 18
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.860]   have been sexually abused.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.140]   That is a testament to the fact
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:37.840]   that we live in a world so comfortable
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.260]   and accommodating to unhealthy relationships
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.180]   and yet Christ, he makes no space
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.660]   for such relationships to exist.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.540]   He does not want us to have toxic relationships
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.360]   with one another.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.160]   No, he wants us to have redemptive relationships
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.660]   with one another where we consider one another
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.740]   rightly, we treat one another with respect.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.660]   And the reason we can do that is because we know
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.180]   where an unhealthy relationship will look at someone else
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.540]   and they will claim some sense of identity over them.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.440]   We know, under God, until you're married,
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.780]   that person, your boyfriend, your girlfriend,
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.380]   whatever title you wanna put on your relationship,
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:20.300]   that person is not yours.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.180]   They are God's and also they will be somebody's.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.020]   And so as a result, you should treat them with respect.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:34.900]   I'll end with this.
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:41.900]   When Brooke and I got to the end of our relationship,
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:46.620]   by that time, I had made a bunch of mistakes
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.960]   over the course of my dating history.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.620]   And yet when we met in college,
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.340]   having learned some of these principles
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.100]   through spiritual mentors,
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.300]   we made a commitment to one another.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.940]   We wanna do this thing right.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.940]   And I remember the day that I went to her father
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.780]   to ask his blessing for her hand in marriage,
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.660]   I could do so with a guilt-free conscience
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.060]   because we did it.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.940]   We did it right.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.640]   Now, to be very clear, we did it imperfectly.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.000]   And yet we had entrusted ourselves
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.360]   over the course of our relationship to a God
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:26.600]   that had done all of this perfectly himself.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   You see, in Jesus, when we were isolated, he was inclusive.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.920]   He looked upon a people that did not want him
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.000]   and he said, "I will give myself for your sake
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.240]   "to bring you into my family.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.780]   "I want you to be with my people
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.640]   "associated amongst the brothers and sisters
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.840]   "in God's name."
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:52.020]   When we were critical, we see in Christ one who was kind,
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.140]   one that sought us even when we didn't deserve it.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.080]   He moved towards us with a kind of steadfast and loyal love
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.580]   that said, "I will go any length to get them.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.220]   "It doesn't matter what they've done.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.760]   "It doesn't matter how far they've fallen.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.220]   "It doesn't matter the gravest, darkest secret
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.440]   "in their past, I will lay my life down for them
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.840]   "and I will seek them at every cost
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.640]   "because I am kind to them.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.440]   "They don't deserve my kindness,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.940]   "but I will lavish upon them a kindness
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.960]   "that they have not known, that once they know it,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.600]   "they might love me and live in light of it
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.760]   "the rest of their days."
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.360]   We see in Jesus that when we were naive,
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   wayward, wandering in our sin, he was vigilant.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.080]   He gave no ground.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.760]   He stood right where we meant to stand.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.360]   He endured our punishment against our sin
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.240]   by absorbing God's wrath upon our cross
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.600]   because he wanted to fight for the one whom he loved.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.880]   That's our God.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.240]   That's your king.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.720]   That's your husband.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.520]   He's one who says, "I will be vigilant in their place.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   "I will fight away that which seeks to destroy
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.980]   "the ones whom I love.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.400]   "I will do so at the greatest cost."
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.840]   And then we see in Jesus that while we were reckless,
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   he was respectful in that he honored God
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:22.080]   and he fulfilled the purposes for which he was sent.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   And he has honored you in that when you did not deserve it,
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.040]   were not worthy of it,
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:33.760]   he lavishes love upon you anyways.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.720]   This is the love of God.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.360]   If you want to make dating easier,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.200]   if you want to make your life easier,
