[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.960]   All right, what is up guys, friends listening in
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.320]   wherever you are tuning in from.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.980]   And of course, I've got some friends here
[00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.820]   that are gonna be joining us
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.160]   as we continue this series,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.200]   fact check part two, facing the truth about our faith
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200]   and putting some of the claims and beliefs
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.600]   that Christians have really held to on the stand
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.840]   and fact checking them.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.640]   So last week we covered how can God be good
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640]   and bad things still happen.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.400]   And each week we're covering just some of the claims
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.520]   of how can Jesus be the only way?
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.840]   How can a loving God send people to hell?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.240]   And tonight we are launching into
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.600]   another one of those topics.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.020]   But let me give a quick story
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.600]   that'll give us some direction for where we're going.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.680]   I've got a philosophy.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.800]   When I, when we've owned a couple of homes
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.280]   that we've lived in and then we moved on to another one
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   and sold that one and moved to another house.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.780]   And each time we bought a house,
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.040]   I've embraced a little philosophy.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.040]   So this is just for free for anybody out there.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.160]   And here's the way that I think about when we buy a house.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.880]   We look for the home that everybody else
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.160]   is gonna be afraid of wanting
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.760]   because of something wrong with it.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.920]   Well, in other words, if there's a home
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.500]   that has criteria or things about it
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.400]   that it's like, oh, there's mold in there
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.680]   or there's foundation problems,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.120]   whatever characteristics are gonna make everybody else
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.100]   be like, honey, we are moving on.
[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.120]   That is not the house.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.600]   That is the one that we want or that I want.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.680]   And my loving wife goes along with or tolerates.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.600]   That's why marrying well is important, fellas.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.640]   But point being, when it comes to houses,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.200]   that's just been kind of the offense that we've run.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.600]   It's high risk, but it also comes with high reward.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.960]   And it allows you to get usually a deal
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.280]   because most people are scared away
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.640]   from getting that type of house.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840]   So there was a chance a couple of years ago
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.600]   where there was a house that came on the market
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.240]   and it was, actually it was off market,
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.920]   but some friends had told us about it being available
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.680]   and we found out more about the property
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.600]   and it was what's called a distressed property.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.760]   So there was like some issues with it.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.520]   So we went and saw it and we had known
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.400]   that there was foundation issues,
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.060]   which is a big deal as it comes to a house.
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.320]   And we knew there were foundation issues,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.640]   but they had fixed them.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.680]   But because the foundation issues were so significant,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.640]   although they had recently fixed the foundation,
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.660]   they hadn't fixed all of the problems with the house
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.740]   that had come from its foundation being off.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.600]   So literally every single door in this house was jacked up.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   It was all on an angle.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   Some doors you couldn't even open
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.120]   because the foundation had shifted
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   and it moved things around in the house
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.720]   and it didn't allow you to open all the doors.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   Windows were jacked up, there are cracks in the ceiling,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.640]   all types of problems.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.580]   The upstairs bathroom didn't work
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.040]   because the plumbing had gotten jacked up
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.060]   with all the foundation stuff.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.440]   So we go see this house
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.200]   and this is like a dream come true for me.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.520]   'Cause I'm like, dude, this is gonna scare everybody away.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.480]   This is a house that we should seriously consider.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.480]   But there was foundation problems.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.280]   And before, I made like a good deal,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.000]   but I'm not gonna move my entire family into a house
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.680]   that if the foundation is not fixed,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.360]   it's gonna continue no matter if we fix all the doors,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.860]   it's gonna continue to be a big problem for our family.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.040]   So I began to go like, hey, how can I put it to the test
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.040]   to make sure that the foundation that is here
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.580]   has been fixed, it is trustworthy,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.400]   this isn't gonna continue going forward.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.600]   We're not gonna, in six months after replacing the doors,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.240]   be like, the doors still don't open again
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.500]   or don't open again.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.600]   How can I make sure that happens?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.080]   So we began to like invest stuff
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.240]   I wouldn't normally do to a house that I didn't own
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   where we were like, it's worth it though.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.200]   Before we move our life into here,
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.860]   we need to test this and pay engineers and pay architects
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.400]   and have someone come out
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.900]   to make sure this foundation is fixed, it is solid,
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.280]   it is trustworthy and you can live your life
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.520]   and rebuild this house on top of it.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.440]   And what does that have to do with tonight
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.680]   what we're talking about?
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   So tonight we're continuing and we are looking at
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.160]   one of the most key objections
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   I think that a lot of people have,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.440]   which is how can I know the Bible is the words of God?
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.680]   Or how can I trust the Bible?
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.240]   Hasn't been changed over time, is it really reliable?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.660]   In other words, is it a foundation
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.320]   that I can build my life on?
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.440]   'Cause that's, Jesus even said his teachings
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.560]   were like a foundation that you should build your life on.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.840]   And when we think about our faith,
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.120]   the Bible is a foundation that is at the epicenter
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.760]   and beneath all the Christian teachings.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.980]   Like if we can't trust the Bible,
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.940]   then our foundation is totally done.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.940]   And yet if we, for many of us,
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.500]   we build our life on these teachings
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.040]   and along the journey, maybe you were a Christian
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.920]   and you began to build your life on the teachings
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.160]   of the Bible and the teaching of Jesus.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.680]   And then at some point in life, somebody came along
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.020]   and they were like, hey, you know,
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.980]   the Bible has been changed or there's contradictions in it
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.080]   or there's problems with it, or it's really outdated.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.960]   You can't build your life on that thing.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.340]   And all of a sudden it's like our foundation got knocked
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.440]   and our faith just shakes.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.760]   And does it have to be that way?
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.860]   And I believe the answer is no.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.200]   And so tonight, I just wanna talk about
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.600]   some of the key objections as it relates
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.280]   to the foundation of God's word and examine together,
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.420]   putting it to the test over whether or not it is trustworthy,
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.380]   can we build our life on top of it?
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.200]   And is it worth living according to?
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.220]   'Cause think about it for a second.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.160]   If it's true, I think a lot of us entertain the idea
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   that maybe it's not true.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.800]   But I want you for a second to entertain the idea,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.240]   what if it's true?
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   What if every single part of it is accurate?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.400]   It's true, it's true, it happened.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.940]   It changes everything.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.280]   And if it is true, then we shouldn't be afraid
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.760]   of examining and putting it to the test
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.260]   and asking the hard questions.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.680]   Because if you're anything like me,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.600]   you went to school or college or had people in your family
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.700]   that came along at some point and said,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.200]   "Hey, I'm not sure you can really trust that.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.120]   "And tonight I just wanna put to the test
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.320]   "the foundation of God's word.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   "Is it something that we can build our life on?"
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.680]   So I'm gonna answer three questions.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.340]   Number one, what is in the Bible?
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.760]   Just a high level in case you've never heard it,
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.920]   or maybe you got this message past you from a friend
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.080]   and you don't have kind of a great understanding
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.640]   of even what the Bible is.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.320]   And I'm sure you're a quick learner
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.320]   'cause you're listening in tonight.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.600]   So I'm just gonna high level explain
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.680]   what even the Bible is, what it contains.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.520]   Then go into, can I trust the Bible?
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.360]   Can I trust it?
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   Has it been changed?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   Does it contradict itself?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   If so, how and where?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.580]   And then what should I do with it?
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.840]   So let me start with what is in the Bible?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.560]   Is it just a religious book and just like,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.920]   any of the different religious books out there?
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.440]   No, you would expect me to say that,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.760]   but here's why I would say that.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.680]   First off, let me explain inside of the Bible,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.920]   the word Bible is kind of comes from a Latin word.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.360]   It just means La Biblia, it's like the books.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.560]   And a better way of understanding
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.680]   or thinking about the Bible is it's not just one book.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.360]   It's like this library of books.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.480]   It's a bunch of different books that are in there.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.600]   And if you were to compare it to the way
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.360]   that our books currently we read,
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.720]   there's like a chapter when you read
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.040]   just kind of modern books today,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.640]   almost each of the different books in the Bible
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.520]   are like a different chapter.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.160]   So Genesis is a chapter and then Exodus is a chapter.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.480]   And inside of the Bible,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.040]   there's 66 of those books or chapters.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.240]   And they break up into two parts.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.480]   You got part one, we call it the Old Testament.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.180]   Part two, New Testament.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.320]   Inside of the Old Testament, what's that about?
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.200]   Old Testament is about the people of God,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.960]   nation of Israel and God's relationship with them
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.780]   and his plan and his working through that nation.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.320]   And then the New Testament is really the story of Jesus
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.160]   and everything after.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.080]   Everything in the Old Testament, it's all before Jesus.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.120]   Everything in the New Testament,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.520]   that's Jesus and everything after.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.840]   And one of the reasons why you're thinking,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.460]   hey, when I read the Bible, it's kind of hard to follow.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.780]   Like I don't exactly understand what's going on.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.400]   It doesn't read like a Harry Potter novel
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.800]   where I can just, I can seamlessly follow.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.960]   And yet people say it's this one storyline
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.800]   that God has written from beginning to end.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.480]   Why is it hard to sometimes follow?
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.220]   And here's the answer why.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.040]   It doesn't take place in chronological order.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.920]   If you've ever opened it
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.080]   and you can actually buy a Bible
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.280]   that goes in chronological order,
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.240]   but the typical Bible that people read,
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.460]   the average American has one, nine out of 10.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.560]   The typical Bible that is there
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.440]   is grouped up into different genres.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   And some of those genres,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.520]   so in other words, if you were to open up,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.320]   it's not grouped in order of sequence.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.640]   It's like it's grouped based on the type of literature.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.920]   You guys remember like types of literature,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.260]   like you got poetry and you got fiction and nonfiction.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.240]   In the Bible, they group it up
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.200]   into these different categories.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.040]   So the first five books are called the law.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.000]   That was like Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.100]   and Deuteronomy and Numbers, that's the law.
[00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.440]   And then you have the historical books.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.240]   All this is in part one, the Old Testament.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.880]   So you've got the law, then you've got historical books.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.640]   Then you've got like poetic stuff.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   This is Job and the Psalms,
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.200]   which is like the Spotify playlist for the nation of Israel
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   kind of as poetic and there's repetition and imagery
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.160]   and it's really beautiful stuff.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.100]   And then you have the prophecy books,
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.200]   which are those guys in the Old Testament
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.680]   that are always saying, "Let's say it the Lord,"
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.480]   and they seem just a little bit upset.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.560]   That's the prophetic books.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.320]   You got major ones and minor ones, but the prophecy books.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.520]   And then you have the gospels.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   That's when you get into the New Testament.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.960]   So all of that was in the Old Testament.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.920]   Then you get to the New Testament
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   and it's still grouped by category.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.480]   And you've got these four gospels,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.840]   which are just four accounts of the life of Jesus.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.120]   And then you have the letters or the epistles,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:10.960]   some people call them,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.560]   but it's basically the letters of the guys
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.640]   who knew Jesus and walked with him.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.640]   And then you have the prophetic book or kind of end times,
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.520]   which is the book of Revelation,
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.480]   but it's grouped up into that.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.360]   And so if you've ever found yourself wondering like,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.320]   "Man, why is this kind of hard to follow?"
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.800]   It's 'cause it's grouped in by genre
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.880]   and yet it has one storyline written throughout it.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.620]   It's pretty remarkable, honestly.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.360]   There's 40 different authors that have written
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.400]   over 2000 years, the storyline.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.680]   And the storyline is simply this,
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.120]   it's how God's from the very beginning of time,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   his plan of redemption,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.200]   his plan to save the human race through Jesus.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.320]   That's from beginning to end.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.140]   And you may be going,
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.640]   "Well, then why is it sometimes hard to follow in there?"
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.560]   It's like this, you guys ever seen the show, "This Is Us"?
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.720]   Anybody? Yeah?
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.120]   Okay, so you know in "This Is Us",
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.680]   there's these moments of flashback
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.200]   where Kate will have this flashback
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.600]   to an earlier time in her life,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.040]   or even there's fast forwards where Rebecca has something
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.840]   and they're back to modern day
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.120]   and then they flashback to an earlier time.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.420]   And it can be, unless you know the storyline,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.120]   it can be kind of hard to follow.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.680]   In other words, when somebody joins you for the first time
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.600]   and they've never seen any of it,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.740]   and then they're tuning in, they're like,
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.600]   "Wait a second, why is she old in this shot?
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.060]   "And why is she young in that one?"
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.120]   Because there's this bigger picture storyline
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.220]   that's going on.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.800]   And unless you see the full picture,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.640]   it's hard to exactly go there.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.480]   That's essentially what the Bible is.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.320]   But it's possible to see the full picture,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.320]   but if you just pick it up and you open up to one chapter,
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.840]   you're not gonna understand the storyline.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.160]   It's like a version of "This Is Us."
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.040]   But the story that God has been writing
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.640]   from the beginning of time is his rescue plan.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.000]   And you can go to very early in Genesis
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.440]   and you see Jesus told about in Genesis chapter three,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.040]   where God said, "There's gonna come a day
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.640]   "I'm gonna get rid of everything evil
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.260]   "and broken in this world.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.320]   "And I'm gonna send someone who will crush all of the sin,
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.800]   "all of the pain, all of the brokenness.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.920]   "And he's gonna die for humanity's sin."
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.600]   And all throughout the Bible, that storyline is there.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.320]   But that's big picture, what God is writing.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.440]   And that's the storyline of the Bible.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.680]   So that's what's in it.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.280]   Okay, so now the bigger question is, can I trust the Bible?
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.820]   Like, can I trust what it says?
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.760]   How do I know that it hasn't been changed?
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.240]   How do I know that it wasn't just made up
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.300]   by some guys hundreds of years later,
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.960]   or this myth that was put forward?
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.520]   Like, how can I trust?
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.000]   'Cause let's be honest,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.080]   that's a really big and important question.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.320]   Me being told I should trust it
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.560]   is very different from me being shown
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.720]   and compelled why it is trustworthy.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.560]   So I wanna attempt to answer two questions.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:41.840]   The first being, is it possible that these are just myths
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.280]   that were made up years and years later?
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.440]   No, here's why I say that.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.280]   There's a couple of reasons.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.840]   The first one being this, and just listen to me
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.080]   in case you're tuning me out and you're like,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.680]   "Oh man, no, my professor said this."
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.800]   Or some guy on YouTube who's like,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.740]   "The Bible stinks, '09," gave you some comment
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.760]   that threw your faith off, tune back in
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   because you may have abandoned it too soon.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.320]   The reason why I say it couldn't have been a myth
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.520]   developed hundreds of years later,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.780]   like the Da Vinci Code says,
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.640]   is because we have copies and we have versions
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   of the New Testament and of gospel writings,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.760]   of the book of John specifically,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.680]   that date all the way back to between 90 and 110 AD,
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.040]   which is right around the time of the life of John.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.840]   In other words, we have the story in the gospel
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.960]   very, very early on and very immediately after
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.320]   Jesus and the disciples and all of that timeline
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.260]   was taking place.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.320]   The idea that hundreds of years later,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.500]   people came in and they showed up
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.780]   and they just made this story up
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.080]   'cause they just all wanted power and that's what they did,
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.080]   that is not possible.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.120]   Is it possible that maybe the disciples,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   now here's a more interesting question.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.760]   Is it possible that the disciples,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.280]   I'm talking Peter, John, James, Andrew,
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.480]   they got together and they decided,
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.040]   "We're gonna make up a myth,
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.160]   "it's gonna turn the world upside down.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.780]   "Gonna make up, we gotta have a hero,
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.880]   "let's call him Jesus.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.800]   "No, I like Jesus better, let's go with that one."
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.400]   And they just begin to put this plot together
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.840]   and they're like, "Let's get our story straight.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.820]   "It's gonna turn the world upside down
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.560]   "and we're gonna end up all dying for it,
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.820]   "but everyone needs to be cool with it
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.000]   "'cause someday people will name their children after us
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.840]   "and they're gonna be like,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.260]   "Oh, Peter, for thousands of years.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.440]   "Yeah, let's all get together."
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.580]   And they got together and they began to plan out
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.640]   how they would make up this myth
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.140]   that all of them would die horrifically for.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.680]   And the myth involved a Jewish peasant
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.640]   from a place you can't identify on the map,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.440]   but it was so compelling
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.800]   that all of them went to their deaths
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.640]   and hundreds of others did as well
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.960]   and it turned the world upside down.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.720]   And today, every atheist, Buddhist, Christian person
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.960]   on the planet dates their calendar
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.080]   by the date of this man that they made up.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's a pretty genius plan for some fishermen
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.760]   who could barely read and write.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.600]   And so is it possible?
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.860]   Anything is possible.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.340]   Is it logical or likely?
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.060]   No, what I mean by anything's possible,
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.460]   like when it comes to history, you just,
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.820]   you gotta know this.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:04.780]   You cannot prove anything historically.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.180]   And you may be going, "Yeah, you can."
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.020]   No, you can't.
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.300]   You can look at the evidence and based on the evidence,
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.500]   judge, what's a reasonable explanation for that?
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.460]   Like, for example, I would guess most of you
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.860]   believe in George Washington, right?
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.860]   Anybody not believe in George Washington?
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.860]   Why do you believe in George Washington?
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.760]   Because history books,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.980]   because somebody told you about it
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.060]   and you read about it and you believed in there.
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.260]   Have you ever met George Washington?
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.260]   Do you know anybody who has ever met George Washington?
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.980]   You believe in George Washington by faith.
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.380]   And you know what's possible?
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.300]   It's a hoax.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.020]   There was never George Washington.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.980]   There was never any founding fathers that are here.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.540]   We're not even really real.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.780]   We're all in the matrix
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.780]   and everything I'm doing right now is not real.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.100]   Is that possible?
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.520]   Anything is possible.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.300]   Is it likely?
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.120]   Is it probable?
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.940]   Is it reasonable enough to live your life according to?
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.260]   No, and as unreasonable as it is to reject
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.420]   the idea of George Washington,
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:05.060]   it is unreasonable to look at these fishermen disciples
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.660]   and think, I bet they came up with a myth
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.580]   that would turn the world upside down.
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.780]   And it wasn't because they would get any financial gain.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.840]   Nope, they lost everything, including their own lives.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.440]   And they did all of it and went to their death saying,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.100]   this is not about some movement I'm starting.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.100]   All of them died for the same reason.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.480]   I saw a man die on a cross
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.140]   and he was buried in the ground.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.280]   And then he came back alive and you can kill me.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.540]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.920]   But he said, if I trust in him,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.100]   I'm gonna have eternal life.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.760]   And every one of them lost their life for that.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.660]   Could it have been a myth
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.220]   that they just got together and made up?
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.120]   Sure, it's possible.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.180]   It's not reasonable.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.320]   Okay, so maybe they didn't make that all up.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.220]   Maybe the Bible has just changed over time.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.540]   Like maybe some of the versions and the stories
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.920]   and maybe they got kind of added and changed along the way.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:55.760]   There's two problems.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.960]   One I already mentioned.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.120]   We have manuscripts that go way back
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.820]   into the first century, into the times
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.080]   and right after the disciples and everyone was there.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.900]   And at the time they were there.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.720]   The second problem is the number of the manuscripts.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.880]   Like we have so many thousands of manuscripts
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.080]   and they all, they don't tell like very different stories.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.400]   Like, oh, there's this version of the Bible
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.320]   and then there's this version.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   They all tell the exact same story.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.580]   Here's what I mean.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.620]   When it comes to manuscripts,
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.780]   you may have heard some of this stuff in school before.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.660]   You may have heard of this.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.120]   When it comes to the idea of like Caesar, Caesar's lives,
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.260]   there's a book called Caesar's Lives.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.140]   How many versions and copies of Caesar's lives
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.660]   do you think we have?
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.700]   You may have heard of this book.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.540]   We have 10.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.000]   Plato, anybody heard of Plato?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.580]   Not the stuff that you play with, like the guy, Socrates.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.380]   How many versions of Plato do we have from the ancient world?
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.940]   Like how many copies?
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.260]   Seven.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.020]   Tacitus, the Roman historian.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.440]   He's responsible for the reason
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.760]   we know so much about Rome and that history.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.480]   How many do we have of him?
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.320]   20.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   If you studied history, you like me learned that,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.280]   hey, Tacitus, this is true.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.760]   You can take it to the bank.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.160]   We have 20 copies of that.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.120]   Homer's Iliad.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.280]   How many of you have Homer's Iliad?
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.960]   643, that's not bad.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.920]   It's a lot better than the other ones.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.360]   How many copies do we have of the New Testament?
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.600]   You guessed it, Lauren.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.020]   24,633.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.560]   We have an enormous number and all of those,
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.840]   to a 99.5% are entirely the same,
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.980]   with the exception of a couple of things.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.840]   Some of them have some spelling errors.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.200]   Like one has John with two Ns, one has John with one.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.640]   Where it's like, oh, that's the type of changes
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.840]   that make people go, I'm not sure we can trust the Bible.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.700]   Because one guy who was making a copy,
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.520]   put an extra N on there.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.480]   The other ones, this is again, 99% of any of the differences
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.680]   between those thousands of manuscripts
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.580]   have to do with the order of words.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.840]   One says Christ Jesus, and this one says Jesus Christ.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.520]   Which one was it?
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.980]   In other words, the differences don't make any difference
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.400]   in terms of actual beliefs.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.920]   Let me give you some of the examples of like,
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.240]   'cause there is 0.5 where the actual word is different.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.360]   There's 0.5% where it actually makes a difference
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.400]   in the reading of the sentence.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.640]   And I remember in grad school, we'd actually study these.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.040]   And you would think like, dude, that's exciting.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.280]   We're about to look at like the text that's like,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.280]   oh man, this says Jesus had a girlfriend named Sarah.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.240]   And this one says he was in a biker gang,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.760]   all these different, maybe these are gonna be
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.840]   some really exciting differences in the versions.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.240]   Here's one of the more exciting ones.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.480]   Comes from 1 Thessalonians 2, verse seven.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.760]   We have one copy of it that says,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.120]   "But we were gentle among you,
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.920]   "like a nursing mother taking care of her own children."
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.540]   We have another copy that they found that says,
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.960]   "But we were infants among you,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.120]   "like a nursing mother taking care of her own children."
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.200]   Is it gentle or is it infants?
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.760]   In Greek, the word has one letter difference,
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.840]   napioi or apioi.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   You decide.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   I think it's infants.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.040]   The vast majority of manuscripts in all the copies say like,
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.360]   it's infants.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.680]   But could it be that it was gentle?
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.520]   Sure.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.800]   But that doesn't make any difference.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.320]   So anybody and any parent or any friend or any uncle
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   who comes up and is like,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.640]   "The Bible has been changed, there's so many differences."
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.120]   You can say, "Uncle, one,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.840]   "do you know the differences
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.020]   "do not make any difference at all?
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.600]   "Two, have you ever studied anything on that subject?"
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.360]   Because by him even phrasing it like that,
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.240]   it reflects the fact that he's ignorant.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.800]   It is intellectually lazy
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.040]   to say that the Bible has been changed
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.400]   to any degree that is untrustworthy.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.560]   There's not a single belief, doctrine, teaching
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.160]   of Jesus or in the Bible that changes.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.120]   And even the differences like that,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.520]   we have thousands that we can see like,
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.200]   "Oh yeah, it's probably infants, but it could be gentle,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.480]   "but it doesn't change anything.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.920]   "The Bible is trustworthy."
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.680]   Could it have been made up myths by men years later?
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.520]   No.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.200]   Could it have been made up on the scene by Peter,
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.660]   getting the gang together?
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:02.880]   Maybe.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.840]   Is it reasonable?
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.680]   No.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.520]   Has it been changed over time?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.360]   No.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.000]   The real reason, candidly, while people don't want to accept
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.840]   or believe that the Bible,
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.180]   and they throw up this smoke screen of like,
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.480]   "You know what's been changed over time?
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.320]   "You can't trust it."
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   And there's so many translations that it's outdated.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.660]   It's not because the Bible contradicts itself.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.500]   It's because the Bible contradicts them.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.560]   It's because they think,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.460]   "If I really accepted this as true,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.180]   "I'm gonna have to change things,
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.740]   "or my girlfriend may stop sleeping with me,
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.100]   "or I don't like what it says about homosexuality,
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.720]   "so I'm gonna hide behind the smoke screen of,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.320]   "you know, we can't trust that thing in any ways.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.120]   "It's a 2,000-year-old book, and you can't believe that."
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.040]   And it's not because the Bible came up in error.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.420]   It's because the Bible contradicted them.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.800]   So what's in the Bible?
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.260]   And then we looked at, can I trust the Bible?
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.880]   Yes.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.900]   What should I do with the Bible?
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.960]   You should read it and apply it.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.900]   Read it and apply it.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.120]   First, that involves understanding how to study it.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.280]   It means you pick up God's Word,
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.720]   or you pick up the Bible, and you begin to read it,
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.440]   and you begin to go, "What is the eternal truth
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.600]   "in the verses and the passage that I'm reading?"
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.720]   Don't read it like an eight ball.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.140]   And candidly, this is how I see a lot of Christians
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.640]   read the Bible, is they take it,
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.080]   and they're like, "I'm gonna shake this thing,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.740]   "and should I move to Houston to take this job?"
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.860]   And then they open it up, and they're like,
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.200]   "Oh, man, this says, 'Hoshefeth moved to Baal.'"
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.040]   Oh, I think maybe that means Houston.
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.720]   That's not a good way to read the Bible,
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.840]   or people will think, "Am I supposed to marry Sarah?"
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.060]   And then they flip open, and they're like,
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.300]   "Look, and there, look at this verse.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.560]   "It says Sarah, Sarah, she's in the Bible."
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.400]   And it's like, "Yeah, she's in the Bible.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.580]   "That doesn't mean you should marry Sarah."
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.800]   And this is how people will think about it,
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.920]   and that's a bad way to read it.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.400]   You should pick a starting point, pick a gospel,
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.440]   and begin to read it, and begin to ask the question,
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.160]   "Hey, what is the eternal truth,
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.400]   "or what was the truth then?
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.240]   "What was he saying then?
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.540]   "What's the truth always, and what is the truth now?
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.620]   "How does this apply to my life?"
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.100]   Begin to look through and see
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.940]   what are the principles that apply.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.420]   The second thing that is involved in, as you're reading it,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.140]   is you begin to read it through the lens
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.300]   of the New Testament and the work of Jesus on the cross.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.540]   In other words, when it relates to the Old Testament,
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.420]   how should we read it?
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.340]   We read it in light of the New Testament
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.500]   and the work that Jesus did on the cross.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.340]   In other words, when I come across verses
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.000]   in the Old Testament that are like,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.560]   "And then if you do this sin,
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.420]   "you need to get three turtle doves and a goat,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.140]   "and you need to kill 'em all."
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.740]   No, you don't, unless you want Peter coming to your house.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.460]   Those, through the lens of the New Testament,
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.380]   were all finished by Jesus on the cross.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.640]   The sacrifice was made by him.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.300]   So I read everything that I go through
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.140]   through the lens of the New Testament.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.980]   Also, as I go through it,
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.700]   you need to know that there's a lot of things in the Bible
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.500]   that it's not condoning or encouraging,
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.980]   it's just describing.
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.560]   In other words, there's a difference when it says,
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.160]   "Hey, this is what you should do,
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.760]   "and this is what they did."
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.060]   Like there's times in the Bible
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.540]   where it's not telling you you should do this,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.160]   it's just telling you what happened.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.020]   Like Solomon had a thousand wives.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.320]   It's not saying, "Hey, this is goals, guys.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.860]   "You need a thousand wives."
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.140]   It's just describing what happened.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.060]   God wasn't for that.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.480]   And we learn in the New Testament,
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.100]   when we read through the lens of the New Testament,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.400]   we're like, "Oh."
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.220]   When Paul talks about what marriage should look like
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.740]   in Ephesians chapter five,
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.500]   husbands should love their one wife
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.220]   and lay down their life and sacrifice.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.560]   Huh, Solomon didn't get this thing right.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.000]   And that's the way that we see that.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.840]   We don't see it as like,
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.020]   "Oh, this is kind of how I should see
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.140]   "the way that I should live my life."
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.560]   Because there's a difference between what happened
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.020]   or what you should do, the Bible laying out,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.020]   "Here's what you should do,
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.660]   "and here's what they did in that moment."
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.620]   So other tips, here's what would be good to know.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.340]   So what translation should I read?
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.180]   'Cause you may hear this,
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.100]   like there's so many translations,
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.080]   which one should I read?
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.460]   We just did a Views from the Porch,
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.500]   which is our podcast.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.260]   You can find on iTunes or Spotify
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.740]   and go check out the latest episode
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.340]   or one or two ago on Bible translations.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.980]   What translation should you read?
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.880]   Whichever one you're going to read.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:21.320]   In other words, is NLT and NIV and ESV, you pick one.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.860]   If you like New King James
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.460]   or you like King James and Shakespearean English,
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.300]   you do you.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.180]   But whichever one you're going to pick up and read,
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.300]   and if you want more information
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.340]   on even why they're different translations,
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.860]   go check out that episode of Views from the Porch.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.560]   But pick up that, start in a gospel.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.620]   Matthew, especially if you're new to Bible reading,
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.540]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.980]   those are first century accounts of the life of Jesus.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.000]   And they were written by men who just said,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.500]   "I just saw this guy die, get buried,
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.940]   "he came back alive, and I have to record his account
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.080]   "because it's true and the world needs to know
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.360]   "and begin to read."
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.540]   There's resources that we may put out
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:24:59.700]   either on our blog or online
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.160]   that are other places you could start.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.340]   There's something called Join the Journey
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.900]   where you can join lots of us here.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.060]   It's a Bible reading plan
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.980]   that gets emailed to you every single day,
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.900]   and it has a devotional and scripture.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.500]   Go to jointhejourney.com, you can go there.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.900]   To find out more about just the Bible as a whole,
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.060]   type in Bible Project on YouTube.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.820]   We have some friends that run something called Bible Project.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.540]   It's excellent, it's phenomenal,
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.580]   and you can find out more about Old Testament books.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.620]   And you could just type in a book of the Old Testament
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.160]   and it'll give you a high-level explanation of,
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.080]   "Oh, this is exactly what is going on there."
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.640]   But the point being, begin to read it.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.060]   Do it with other believers in your life.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.520]   This is why we encourage small groups around here,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.600]   or we call them community groups,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.840]   for you to have other people in your life
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.480]   so you can read a passage and go,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.840]   "Man, I have no idea what he's talking about right there.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.180]   "Like, why did God tell them to do that?
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.240]   "Or what is Paul saying there?"
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.760]   And you would have other people in your life
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.460]   who could come alongside of you and be like,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.400]   "Oh man, here, let's answer
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.060]   "and ask those questions together,
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.360]   "and let's find answers together."
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.840]   Get a good study Bible.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.440]   Study Bible is just something that has different ways
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.780]   or explanations and background and context in the verses,
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.760]   or right underneath it,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.560]   so you can know more of what is going on.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.360]   But point being, begin to read and apply it.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.880]   And what you will discover,
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   if you will do that consistently,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.800]   your life will change, and it will change for the better.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.240]   And you can put it to the test,
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.140]   and you're gonna experience that it is a foundation
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.660]   you can build your life on.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.260]   And if you will begin to read it and apply it,
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.700]   I promise you, your life is going to change,
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.340]   and change in every way that you want it to change.
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.940]   There was a study done in 2009.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.080]   It's actually been continued since then.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.540]   But it was a study that basically was done
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.340]   over like 40,000 different Christians in America,
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.620]   ages eight to 80.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.780]   They took everybody, and they were like,
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.220]   "Hey, we're gonna have you all give us some information
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.320]   "and the kind of questions that they asked them
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.380]   "on the survey ranged from how often you look at pornography
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.280]   "to how often you read your Bible
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.380]   "to how often was the last time you were drunk,
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.460]   "and just kind of like some somewhat personal questions."
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.180]   And these people filled it out, and they sent it in.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.200]   And they discovered something really fascinating.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.280]   Again, all these people were Christians.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.880]   They discovered that as it related to reading your Bible,
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.640]   there's like a tipping point in life.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.220]   In other words, if you read it one day a week,
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.720]   there wasn't much change that they saw in their life.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.380]   And the likelihood of just kind of like reoccurring sin
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.660]   taking place in their life, of getting drunk
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.560]   and still looking at porn and sleeping with their girlfriend
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.620]   or sleeping with somebody outside of marriage,
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.980]   all of it remained kind of the same.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.340]   And if you went to two days a week,
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.500]   it remained kind of the same as well.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.120]   You were statistically just as likely
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.580]   as everyone outside of the church.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.480]   If you went to three days a week, same thing.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.280]   And then they discovered there was a tipping point.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.180]   And that tipping point was four days or more.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:48.660]   And they said everyone who reads it four days or more
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.220]   was 57% less likely to get drunk,
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.340]   61% less likely to use pornography,
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.740]   70% less likely to engage in sex outside of marriage.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:02.180]   They were 228% more likely to share their faith with people.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.700]   They were 230% more likely to disciple other people.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.340]   They were 400% more likely to memorize scripture.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.180]   What does all that say?
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.740]   It says that those who read their Bible consistently
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.740]   four days or more, they experienced life change.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.020]   They were transformed.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.420]   If you don't believe me, for the rest of corona,
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.420]   begin to read your Bible every single day.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.980]   Pick up one of the gospels, begin to go through it
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.780]   and begin to study and see
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.460]   if your life doesn't begin to change
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.980]   because here's how it changes.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.460]   We're about to land the plane.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:34.740]   When you begin to read the Bible and read it consistently
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.980]   and not sporadically and kind of once every now and then,
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.980]   you begin to be introduced to the hero of the Bible, Jesus.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.940]   You begin to see him on like every page.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.780]   Like a lot of people think,
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.500]   oh, the reason why your life would change
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.900]   is because like the Bible is this rule book.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.380]   And if you read the rule book every day,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.740]   you probably know the rules.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.860]   So you'll do what the rule book says.
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.260]   No, you read the rule book every day
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.220]   and you discover the Bible is not a rule book at all.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.220]   It's a book about how you and I
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.320]   can have a relationship with God.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.980]   And how from the very beginning of time,
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.700]   he's been on a rescue mission
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.820]   to save every single person out there
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.700]   from the pain of sin and death in our world.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.380]   And inside, when you begin to read,
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.780]   you're introduced to the person of Jesus.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.620]   And you know what the Bible says happens
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.460]   whenever that takes place?
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.180]   The Bible says, you begin to transform.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.540]   2 Corinthians chapter three says, you begin to change.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.300]   The more you see Jesus, your life begins to change
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.300]   from one degree to the next, to the next.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.700]   And any person who reads the scripture
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.000]   and consistently reads it, their life doesn't change
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.220]   'cause they know all the rules.
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   Their life changed because they see Jesus in it.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.480]   From beginning to end.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.860]   Can you trust the Bible?
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.980]   Yes.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.880]   And if you do, and if you apply it,
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.060]   you're gonna experience a life
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.660]   like you could hardly even imagine.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.780]   And you could build your life
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.380]   on the foundation of his word.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.940]   And when you do, your life is gonna transform
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.160]   and you're gonna see Jesus on every page.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.900]   Let me close with this just to emphasize that point.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.300]   In Luke chapter 24, we're told of a story
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.100]   that takes place right after Jesus rose from the grave.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.860]   In other words, right after he was crucified,
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.220]   towards the end of the book of Luke, the gospel of Luke,
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.740]   we're introduced to an interaction that Jesus has.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.660]   He rises from the grave, he comes back to life,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.260]   and he hasn't totally shown everybody himself yet.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.500]   He hasn't totally introduced to all of the disciples.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.500]   He's alive.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.340]   Hey, this is real.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.120]   And we're told that there were two of his disciples
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.300]   who were walking on the road.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.220]   It's called the road to Emmaus.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.100]   They were just walking from one town to the next.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.460]   And Jesus sees them,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.620]   and he begins to walk up to these two guys,
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.200]   and it's like a seven mile walk, we're told.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.060]   And he joins the conversation.
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.220]   But we're told for whatever reason,
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:53.340]   they couldn't see Jesus.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.700]   They didn't recognize him.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.120]   They didn't know exactly who he was.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.980]   For whatever reason, he kind of like disguised himself
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.940]   and Jesus shows up and he's like, hey, what's up guys?
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.900]   And they were like, oh, you know,
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.060]   we're just grieving the fact that the Messiah
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.220]   we thought was the king just died.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.780]   And he begins to enter in this conversation.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.420]   He's like, what are you talking about?
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.560]   And they say, are you the only person?
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.420]   We just read the verse.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.620]   Are you the only person?
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.420]   The only one visiting Jerusalem who doesn't know
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.060]   about the things that have happened here in these days?
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.900]   And he says, what things?
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.820]   In other words, they're like, hey,
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.180]   are you the only person that hasn't read
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.220]   the Jerusalem Times?
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.060]   There's a coronavirus going on, bro.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.940]   There was a guy we thought was king and he died.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.160]   We thought he was gonna save the world
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.860]   and save the nation of Israel, which is what they said.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.200]   He was sentenced to death and they crucified him.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.420]   We hoped he had been the one that was gonna redeem Israel.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.860]   What more, it's the third day and all of this took place.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.220]   In addition, some of the women, they amazed us
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.100]   because they went to the tomb of Jesus this morning,
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:49.300]   but they didn't find his body.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.860]   They're telling Jesus this entire thing.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:51.740]   And he's just like sitting there
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:52.660]   and listening to the entire thing.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.220]   I love it.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.700]   They came and told us they'd seen angels
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.760]   and that Jesus was alive.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.980]   And some of our companions went
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.340]   and they found the tomb empty just as they had seen.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.680]   And then Jesus jumps in and says something
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.300]   that is so remarkable.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.000]   Think about this conversation.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.380]   Oh, foolish ones, how slow to believe you are
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.240]   that all the prophets have spoken.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.140]   Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.580]   and then enter into glory?
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.660]   Wasn't what happened to Jesus, him dying, him rising,
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.260]   all of that told in the Old Testament
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.100]   and the writings and the prophets.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.600]   And then beginning with Moses and all of the prophets,
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.880]   he explained to them
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:45.280]   what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.880]   Think about that conversation for a second.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.920]   Jesus begins to go,
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.540]   all of the Old Testament, all of the Bible,
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:58.360]   everything you've ever read was all pointing to me.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.200]   In other words, people have a tendency to look at the Bible
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.060]   and they're like, oh, it's a rule book,
[00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.940]   I need to follow the rules
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.340]   and I need to do whatever it says.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.260]   You know what that puts at the epicenter?
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.780]   You, you're not at the center of the story of the Bible
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.680]   and neither am I.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.060]   And Jesus says the entire thing,
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.220]   it's all been pointing to me.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.340]   Chapter or part one, Old Testament, all of it about Jesus.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.140]   Part two, all of it about Jesus,
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.220]   it's all been pointing to him.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.740]   And I just want, think about what that must've been like
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.020]   when he sat there and he walked through,
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.780]   how all of it was pointing to him.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.060]   How Adam, remember how Adam in the garden,
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.060]   he was tempted and he failed.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:34.680]   Jesus also in the garden was tempted,
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.300]   but he passed his test and he went to the cross.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.420]   How we're told about Noah, how God comes to Noah
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.100]   and he says, look, hey, I'm gonna allow you
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.620]   to build and take a piece of wood
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.380]   and any person who trusts in that piece of wood lifted up
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.300]   will be saved from destruction.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.760]   So Jesus, through a piece of wood
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.900]   and him being lifted up on a cross
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.740]   and all who trust in that piece are saved from destruction.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.140]   And he just walks through.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.460]   Yeah, I could just see him on the road.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.300]   He's walking with this guy, he goes,
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.860]   "Think about Abraham, Abraham in a moment where God came
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.060]   and he said, hey, I want you to take your son,
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.020]   your one and only son."
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.220]   It's in the verse.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.580]   I want you to take him and sacrifice him.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.020]   And he takes him to a mountain called Golgotha
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.380]   or Mount Moriah, it's where Golgotha is.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.180]   And miraculously at the last moment,
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.980]   there's a ram that appears and God provides a sacrifice.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.740]   Don't kill your son.
[00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:24.780]   How is it all not pointing to Jesus
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.740]   and God who would as a father sacrifice
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.900]   and make the provision by giving his son on our behalf?
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.220]   Think about David, David killed the giant of Goliath
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.440]   and Jesus killed the giant of sin and Satan and death.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.380]   Jonah spent three days in the belly of a whale
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.840]   and Jesus spent three days at a tomb.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.340]   All of it has been pointing to Jesus.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.860]   He is the Lion of Judah.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.820]   He is the lamb and the sacrificial lamb
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.900]   that died on behalf of you and me and all of humanity.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.980]   He's the rock, he's the light, he's the king,
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.780]   he's the prophet, he's the shepherd.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.100]   And it all points to him.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.060]   And Jesus looks these guys in the eyes
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.020]   and he walks them through all of it.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.420]   And if you begin to read the Bible,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.940]   you'll be introduced to the one who it's all about,
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.160]   who life is all about.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:12.700]   And the one who frankly is the reason we trust it,
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.780]   who gave his life for you and for me.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:19.480]   Every week listening, there are people
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.080]   who not only have not understood what the Bible is,
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.340]   they've never understood what the gospel, the good news,
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.460]   that's just what the word gospel means.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.860]   What that is, and here, let me just give it to you.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.900]   It's that God came to this earth in the form of Jesus
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.740]   and he loved you so much, he died for you and for me.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:35.420]   He gave his life.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.800]   We didn't deserve it, we don't earn it.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.100]   We could never earn it.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.740]   And he gave his life and he died.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.660]   And then he rose from the dead three days later
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.780]   and he defeated death.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.540]   And on that day where he rose, death died.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.760]   And when he rose, it was like the payment for sins,
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.060]   it was like the check cleared.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.660]   It was like the credit card when you're paying for something
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.620]   and it goes through and you're like, yes.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:04.020]   The payment was enough, it was more than enough.
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.900]   And now anyone who puts their faith and trust
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.680]   in what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.900]   accepting that God, you paid for everything, it's true.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.740]   And I can believe it.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.580]   And you gave your life
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.740]   and if I'm gonna have eternal life with you,
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.300]   it's because you gave your life for me.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.860]   Anyone who puts their faith and trust
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.780]   in what Jesus did for them has eternal life
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.320]   and experiences the fulfillment of every prophecy
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.120]   and all of the points
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.100]   and everything that the scripture is about.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.480]   And tonight, if you've never had that moment,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.100]   this is your night.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.660]   And the God who is there has had you stumble
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.320]   listening onto this right now
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.960]   and wherever you listen to this,
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.680]   because he hasn't forgotten you
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.980]   and he gave his life to prove and show that.
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.060]   Let me pray.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:56.780]   Father, thank you that every word of God in the Bible
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.740]   points to the ultimate word of God, which is Jesus.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.160]   Thank you that you are the sacrifice for sins.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.700]   You're the greater David, the greater Adam,
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.260]   the greater Jonah, you're greater than all of them.
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.760]   And every page and every word points to you, our King.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.000]   I pray for anyone listening right now
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.060]   who candidly sits behind the smoke screen
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.380]   of I don't want to believe it
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.780]   'cause if then I'd have to change,
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.100]   you would pierce and penetrate
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.620]   and they'd stop wondering what would I have to change,
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.240]   but could it be true?
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:36.060]   And you would show to them that it is.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.140]   Thank you that you gave your life
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:44.060]   and that anyone who trusts in that can have eternal life.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.520]   We worship you now in song, amen.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:56.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
