[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.000]   - Welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.640]   friends in Fort Worth, friends in Houston,
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.680]   and wherever you are tuning in with us
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.120]   as we continue this dating series
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.960]   as we kick off the fall and people are falling in love.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.080]   I'm gonna start with a story
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.400]   that'll give us some direction for where we're going.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.840]   About 10 years ago, 10 years ago, 10 years ago,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.360]   I was working at a camp in Missouri
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.240]   and I was working for the director of the camp
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.400]   and he was a basically traveling evangelist
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.480]   and he would get asked to go speak all over the country
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.320]   at these different places.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.320]   And he was asked to go speak at a men's kind of rally event
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.720]   where they were gonna fill up
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.000]   the St. Louis Rams football stadium.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.560]   Kurt Warner was gonna be there
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.960]   and my friend was gonna speak at it
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.040]   and he said, "Hey, do you wanna come with me?"
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.000]   And I'm like, "Yeah, absolutely, this sounds awesome."
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.720]   And so we head up, get in the car,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.840]   head out and head the direction of St. Louis,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.640]   which was a few hours away, and we pull up to this airport.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.760]   And I'm like, "What are we doing here?"
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.240]   He says, "We're getting in the jet."
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.640]   They sent a jet that we're gonna get in and fly there.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.800]   And I'm like, "Oh my gosh, this is amazing.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.320]   "This is not normal for me.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.280]   "I didn't grow up in Highland Park."
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.120]   Just kidding.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.960]   So we're, don't email if you're from Highland Park, I know.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   Only like half have jets, I get it.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.920]   So hey, we get in the, I know,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.680]   that's gonna get even more emails, great.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.800]   Okay, so we get in the jet, my friend is there,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.080]   and this is a whole new experience,
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.840]   never had this before, you know, the leather seats.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.680]   It's just, it's a little small jet, four seater.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200]   It's me and him and the pilot.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.300]   And within like three minutes, he falls asleep.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.460]   And he's just like knocked out.
[00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.440]   He's gonna take a nap on our way there.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.680]   And so it's just me kind of with my thoughts and the pilot.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.040]   And so I start talking to the pilot,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.960]   "How long have you been flying?
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   "You know, where are you from?"
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.120]   And eventually he just says,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.480]   "Hey, do you wanna come up here to the cockpit?"
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.880]   "Yes, absolutely."
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   So I'm riding shotgun in this jet.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.040]   And I immediately realized something
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.720]   that I did not know about flying.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.880]   You can't see where you're going.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.560]   Like what I mean by that, in case you're like,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.640]   "Oh yeah, it's kind of like driving a car,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.920]   "you got the windshield up there."
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.840]   All you see, especially if there's heavy cloud cover,
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.280]   is total white.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.600]   Like you don't see any, I could, for all we know,
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.120]   not even be off the ground right now.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.320]   All that I see is smoke in front of us, or clouds,
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.280]   and we're driving or we're flying in the air
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.760]   at hundreds of miles an hour.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.600]   And I'm like, "How do you see?
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.520]   "You can't see anything."
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   And he says, "You don't trust what you see in front of you.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.780]   "The way that you fly, whenever you're up in the clouds,
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.960]   "is you don't do it by kind of what you see
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.480]   "and how you feel.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.040]   "You trust the instruments that you have within the plane."
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.120]   In other words, there's this thing,
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.960]   I was talking to actually a pilot shortly before this,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.320]   who's on our staff, who used to be a pilot.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.040]   And he said, "Yeah, there's something where,"
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.360]   and it's officially called black hole vertigo,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.920]   black hole vertigo, where your senses will mess with you
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.960]   when you're up in the air, like fluid in your ears
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   and a change in the weather around you,
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.080]   and you'll be flying a plane,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.120]   and if you just trust how you feel,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.640]   you'll be like, "Yeah, we're flying level,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.340]   "and you're halfway turned this direction."
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.600]   You'll think that you're flying and you're just pulling up,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   and if you just trust how it feels,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.480]   you'll be literally turning over and about to flip.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   But if you just go off of what you feel
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.440]   and not trusting the instruments that you have there,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.320]   then you are likely to head towards a crash
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.340]   in the midst of the clouds,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.380]   if your head or when you're in the clouds,
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.640]   that you can't go off of what you feel or what you see.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.760]   You have to trust the instruments.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.480]   Can't go off of even your five senses.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.000]   You have to trust the instruments,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.840]   or you'll crash the plane.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.320]   I mean, if you remember JFK Jr.,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.240]   John F. Kennedy Jr., JFK's son,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.680]   tragically was flying in 1999, if you remember that,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.320]   and he was flying his own plane
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440]   with his wife and his sister-in-law,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560]   and what he thought was headed towards
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.900]   just straight the destination
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.600]   was barreling towards the ocean,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.180]   and he didn't make it.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.680]   And all of them, without even calling a distress signal,
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.880]   thought, "We're totally fine,"
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.500]   and he's barreling towards the water
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.560]   and to his death, tragically.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.440]   That just in flying a plane,
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.560]   you cannot trust what you see.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.720]   You have to trust the instruments.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   Now, here's where I start there.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.960]   Because as it relates to dating,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.400]   there is a way in which all of us,
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.860]   if you're gonna experience success in dating,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.740]   or if you don't want to crash and burn in dating,
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.660]   you cannot trust what you see,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.600]   your senses, or your feelings.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.800]   You have to trust the instruments
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.400]   that God has given us in his word.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.440]   In other words, if you just go off of emotion,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.160]   just like a plane, someone flying a plane,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.120]   and they're like, "Yeah, I think I'm headed
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   "in the right direction,"
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.440]   and you're halfway towards the ground
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.840]   and barreling towards disaster,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.920]   if you just go off how you feel,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.860]   you're going to crash and burn.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.040]   That you and I are forced,
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   we must trust the instruments.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.320]   By instruments, I mean the principles
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.540]   or the truths that God has given us
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.240]   inside of his word, as it relates to dating.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   Because whenever you're in love
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.960]   or you're in like, strong like,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.040]   your head is in the clouds.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920]   You can't see the fog around you.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.960]   You're like, "It's amazing,"
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.880]   and you don't even know that you're barrel rolling.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.000]   I mean, everywhere you go,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.840]   you just have soft music in the background
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   and you're running in a field
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.920]   towards them in slow motion.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.160]   And you are trusting your feelings.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.520]   And if you and I are not careful,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.500]   where the only thing that we trust is our feelings,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.800]   we are going to crash and burn.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.480]   So tonight, we're gonna talk,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.240]   if you take notes, we're talking about
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   trusting the instruments that God has given us for dating.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.020]   Because the Bible, unfortunately,
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.260]   the bad news is, doesn't talk a lot about dating.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.400]   Actually, it doesn't talk at all about dating.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.480]   But it does have a lot to say about marriage,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.480]   about sex, about love, and all the in-between stages.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.480]   So tonight, we're gonna look at five things
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.320]   from God's word as it relates to trusting.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   These are the instruments that if you're
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.700]   in a serious dating relationship,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.000]   if you're in any relationship,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.840]   if you ever wanna be in a relationship,
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.160]   these five things are crucial components
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.840]   for you to not neglect and for all of us to trust
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.940]   to avoid crashing and burning as it relates to marriage.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.100]   So we're gonna be really going through these five things
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.340]   as we continue this series on First Comes Love.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.100]   And we're gonna dive right in.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.780]   And here's the first one, is it comes from God's word.
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.180]   That as it relates to dating,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.260]   when you begin to navigate one of the first instruments
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.060]   that you need to make sure that you're evaluating
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.900]   the relationship and, you know, am I in like,
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.380]   am I in love, where am I right now?
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.500]   Is that you make sure that when you look for
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.880]   a potential spouse, that you are looking
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.700]   for character, not curves.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.580]   You are looking for character, not curves.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.500]   You could say it another way.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.360]   You are looking for character, not characteristics.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.440]   That you are physical characteristics.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.320]   That when it comes to, hey, I'm gonna prioritize.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.040]   And I think everyone in the room's like,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.000]   yeah, I want character, but gosh, she is hot.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.720]   And so you have to make sure that you don't follow
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.200]   your feelings and that you are true to trusting the man
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.120]   when it comes to the priority of the person
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.740]   that I'm gonna marry, a person that I'm gonna date.
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.400]   Character above everything else.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.680]   Not an amazing body or a huge bank account,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.780]   but character, because if both of those things can fade
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.080]   or be gone in an instant.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.320]   That Proverbs 31, or this proverb that we're given,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.120]   and if you have time this week, go read it.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.960]   It's an amazing proverb.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.960]   It's written from a mother to her son.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.220]   And she writes this proverb, she's like,
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.220]   baby boy, I'm about to tell you who you need to date,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.120]   who you need to marry, and here's who I want you to look for.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.240]   And inside of the proverb, all these amazing things
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.640]   are said, but she specifically says a couple things
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.120]   about character, here's one of them,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.760]   that she says to her son,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.320]   a wife of noble character, who can find?
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.240]   She is worth far more than rubies.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.880]   Like in other words, hey, let me tell you,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.360]   at the top of the list of things to value,
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:55.660]   is not a great hairdo and not a great external appearance,
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.920]   not that they're an amazing athlete,
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.040]   but is someone of incredible character.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.960]   Then she says this, that son, charm,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.640]   or like a winsomeness, and they're smooth and attractive,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.760]   is deceptive, it can be deceiving.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.080]   Like don't let it fool you,
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.360]   don't let that be the single thing,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.700]   that you're smooth and they're flirty.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.300]   And beauty is fleeting, it's going away,
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.500]   that it won't be here, that regardless
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.040]   of how hot they look right now,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.220]   gravity wins that game on everybody.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.020]   And so don't be deceived, and don't buy in
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.420]   or put your stock in the wrong things,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.780]   but a woman who fears the Lord is worthy to be praised.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.180]   All throughout the proverb, I mean go read it,
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.260]   he says, look, son, don't just look
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.100]   for someone who's gonna make a hot wife
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.520]   and have a great 20s Instagram profile,
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.660]   but look for someone who's gonna be an amazing grandma,
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.860]   an amazing mother, or an amazing husband,
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.420]   an amazing father, an amazing grandfather,
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.500]   someone to grow old and both get ugly together with.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   Look for someone who has character, not curves.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:10.460]   That having a beautiful wife does not mean
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.220]   having a beautiful life, and the same is true
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.180]   with a husband, having a handsome or wealthy husband,
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.660]   gosh, I hope you get this, does not equate
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.620]   to having a beautiful life, and this mother
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.300]   speaks to her son who's a prince, and says,
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.140]   look, you can have any girl you want.
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:36.420]   Don't be fooled by girls who are always so pretty,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.520]   but they don't have character.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.500]   The second idea that we see from the text,
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.340]   or I mean, before we go there, in my notes I just wrote,
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.980]   I mean, it didn't take long to look at Hollywood,
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.100]   and it's clear to see that, man, what matters most
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.100]   in a person's life for their level of satisfaction
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.460]   or just kind of the level of marital satisfaction
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.900]   that I think most of us would want.
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.500]   Nobody's like, you know what my goal is?
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.860]   Divorce, depressed, those are the things
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.700]   that I'm looking for in life.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.260]   I think all of us would be like, man,
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260]   I'd love to be in a relationship defined
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.780]   by someone who loves me, is there to have and hold,
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.180]   for richer, for poorer, sickness and health, they're there.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.020]   And what allows a marriage to be successful
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.500]   is character, not physical characteristics.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.840]   You can see it everywhere you look in Hollywood.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.500]   I mean, how many more People Magazine
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.700]   or whatever magazine articles are gonna come out
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.100]   about Brad and Angelina, they're apart, they're together,
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.980]   they're married, they're not.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.620]   I mean, how many things are relationships,
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.300]   does it take for us to see that, man,
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.540]   you can have a beautiful wife
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.040]   and not have a beautiful life.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.180]   And King Lemuel's mother says,
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.340]   "Look for character over curves."
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.660]   Looks can be deceiving.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.100]   What matters most is on the inside.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.100]   This past week, or this past weekend,
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.940]   our son has been sick for the last little bit,
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.860]   I'll talk about that in a second,
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.420]   and so we've got little kids Motrin,
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.940]   liquid Motrin, all over the place,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.260]   like all over the house, and I'm cooking dinner.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.460]   We got this thing called Blue Apron,
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.980]   it's like a meal, it comes in the mail,
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.740]   and they're mailing us our food.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.580]   And I got the food, I'm cooking it.
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.500]   We had just a crazy last 10 days,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.620]   so I was like, "Hey, wife, Callie,
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.560]   "I want you to go get a foot massage,
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.780]   "which is like half the price of a real massage,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.460]   "but we can do it 'cause it's only like 25 bucks,
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.860]   "so go get a foot massage, I'm gonna make dinner,
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.700]   "it's gonna be awesome."
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.660]   Blue Apron, pull it out, begin to cook the meal.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.860]   Baby's over there watching cartoon,
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.940]   trying to cook the meal, trying to keep things from burning,
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.140]   and I'm making all the food,
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.740]   and I'm just not a great cook,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.900]   so things get burned and things get messed up quickly.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.740]   So I'm following the ingredients, so I think,
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.660]   and there's this little bottle of vinegar,
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.180]   and it's over, and it's supposed to go
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.100]   on kind of the vegetables and kind of poured on everything,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.940]   it's gonna be great.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.700]   And I'm cooking the food, and I'm watching,
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.300]   "Are you still breathing in there, little child?"
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.420]   And, [laughs] his name's Crew, I call him little child.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.900]   And, [laughs] who am I, what kind of dad does that?
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.580]   Anyways, so I'm cooking, and I reach over for the bottle,
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.100]   and I take it, and it looks strikingly similar
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:09.060]   to the liquid Motrin that is right next to it.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.300]   Take it out, take it over, "You okay in there?"
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.660]   Dunk, and the entire bottle of liquid Motrin
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.480]   goes over all of the food.
[00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.540]   And it's like, "Well, all right, pizza night, it is."
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.260]   [audience laughs]
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.740]   Because looks can be deceiving.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.580]   [audience laughs]
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:35.780]   Don't clap for bad cooking, but here's why that matters.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.700]   In the same way that on the outside,
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.660]   they were strikingly similar, like blue apron,
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.940]   please, can we change this?
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.920]   And what mattered most, though,
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.100]   was what was on the inside.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.140]   That's not just pithy, it's not just,
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.460]   oh, that's kinda cute and funny, it is the truth.
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:00.460]   And your marriage will be made or broken on the character,
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.600]   on what's inside of those who are a part of it.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.100]   The second idea that we're gonna pull
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.420]   from really the second instrument to trust
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.900]   goes along with this idea of character,
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.260]   and who to look for, and what to make sure
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.200]   is a component of their life is to make sure
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.680]   the person that you're dating loves Jesus.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.600]   I don't mean like, hey, they say, "I'm a Christian,"
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   they go to church, they went on a mission trip one time,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.380]   they go with their family at Easter, and they seem nice.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.840]   I mean, they love Jesus.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.640]   They are all in with him.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.000]   They know where true life is found,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.680]   they wanna follow him, they love him
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.920]   more than they'll ever love you.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.320]   This is the type of person to date,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.140]   and to consider, or as the relationship develops and moves,
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.340]   to move towards marriage with,
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.460]   make sure that they love Jesus.
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.660]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6, 14,
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   "Do not be yoked or bound together with unbelievers,
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.720]   "someone who doesn't share the same faith,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.740]   "someone who's not in love with Jesus,
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.900]   "someone who may be a cultural Christian.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.940]   "For what does righteousness and wickedness have in common,
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.480]   "or what fellowship can light have with darkness,
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   "that makes sure above everything else
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.900]   "that they love Jesus, how do you know?"
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.340]   Really, if you can't tell, they don't.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.500]   Like, if you're like, I don't know
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.220]   if this is a priority in his life,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.820]   I mean, maybe I should just ask,
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.900]   hey, do you love Jesus?
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.100]   Usually speaking, and that may be like,
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.420]   maybe there's some exception up there,
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.080]   so for the most part, you'll see it.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.260]   It comes out in how they spend their time,
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.800]   how they think about their money,
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.620]   how they use their words,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:50.020]   where they invest their weekends,
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.360]   the friends and the company that they keep.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.380]   Make sure that you're dating someone who loves Jesus.
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.640]   And if not, you need a breakup,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.740]   and you need to tonight, like before you leave.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.960]   And spare yourself the heartache and heartbreak
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.840]   that's gonna happen and come into your life
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.560]   by you dating someone or moving towards marriage
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.880]   with someone who is heading in a different destination,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.500]   in a different direction than you're headed.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.560]   Last week, because we moved kind of a couple weeks ago,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.400]   JP and I were gonna meet at my new house.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.720]   So we were coming from two different places.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.560]   Hey, I'll meet you at my house.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.480]   And as we headed there, I sent him the new address
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.600]   that we're at, and he typed it into his phone,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.860]   I typed it into mine, and we're headed off.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.120]   And I get to the house, and I'm like, where are you?
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.200]   And he said, I'm about to turn on your street,
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.500]   and I said, what cross streets are you at?
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.280]   And he begins to describe the cross streets,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.360]   and they're way over in the other side of town.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.040]   I'm like, you're not about to turn onto my street.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.240]   Well, according to the Waze app, I am.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   And what had happened was that the zip code
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.160]   was a different one, but the same street name,
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.700]   it's just in a zip code that was entirely different,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.020]   and that he had headed towards a very different direction
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.000]   and destination than I had headed towards
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.400]   without even realizing it,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.940]   thinking maybe we're headed in the same direction.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.180]   And what the Bible says, just the fact of the matter is,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.020]   if you are dating someone who's not a believer,
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.800]   you're headed in different destinations,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.120]   different eternal destinations,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.840]   different destinations in this life.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.860]   How can I make it more clear?
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.720]   You're headed towards heaven,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.320]   and they're headed towards hell.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.520]   It's impossible to maintain a strong relationship
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.360]   if Jesus is the main thing in your life,
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.760]   and if it's not the main thing in their life.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.160]   You're headed towards heartbreak.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.040]   There's no way of getting around it.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.000]   And if you're dating someone who's not a believer,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.160]   or who would just say, you know, it's kind of a,
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.200]   yeah, I'm just, I don't take my faith too seriously,
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.960]   you need to get out now.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.460]   If you're not a believer,
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.560]   man, the most significant thing that you can do
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.960]   is not learn any of these dating suggestions,
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.040]   or really truths from the Bible.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.560]   It's not focused on any of them,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.800]   but you need to meet Jesus.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.160]   You're never gonna be able to get it right with your mate
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.780]   until you first are right with your maker.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.360]   And it's impossible for you to enter into a marriage,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.200]   and hey, I'm gonna get it right,
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.160]   and it's gonna be awesome,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.960]   if you have not first got made right with Jesus,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.920]   or with your maker, and your creator.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.080]   So here we go, so we got,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.340]   make sure you value character over curves,
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.720]   or physical characteristics.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.760]   Make sure that the person that you're dating
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.240]   loves Jesus above everything else.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.080]   And then number three,
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.840]   make sure that Christ followers support the relationships.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.680]   In other words, don't follow your feelings,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.960]   don't follow where you think you are,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.300]   'cause the plane may be tipping.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.920]   Make sure that you follow the instruments.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.120]   And the third thing that God tells us from his word
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.360]   that's crucial for success to happen
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.600]   in any sort of planned out,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.240]   or any sort of hopeful future,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.040]   is that other people who love and know Jesus,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.280]   or who walk with God need to be involved.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.480]   Make sure, if you wanna experience success in dating,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.680]   not crash the plane,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.820]   that you have other Christ followers inside of your life
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.520]   who support the relationship.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.440]   Not like your random frat buddies from college
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.040]   who are like, yeah dude, she's cool, man.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.340]   But Christ followers, your community group,
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.140]   people in your family, your small group,
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.340]   or people in your family who know Jesus and love him,
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.460]   they support the relationship.
[00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.300]   And man, this is huge,
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.160]   'cause I can hear people in the room being like, no.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.780]   I mean, they're not supportive because they're jealous.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.800]   They're all against us.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.420]   The world's against, it's a big conspiracy.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.940]   You guys are not star-crossed lovers
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.180]   destined to be together.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.380]   If people in your life are saying,
[00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.300]   I don't think he's good for you,
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.740]   I don't think she's the person
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.780]   that you need to be dating right now,
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.540]   you should have serious concern,
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.800]   especially if they're people who know Jesus
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.140]   and love you and love him.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.820]   What are the people, if you're dating someone,
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.120]   what are the people in your life,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.160]   what are the people who are closest to you,
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.920]   who are also closely seeking to walk with God,
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.020]   or with Jesus, say,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.920]   what would they say about the relationship?
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.480]   Song of Solomon chapter one, verse four,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.560]   talks about this couple who is moving towards marriage,
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.500]   and it says their friends looked on
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.220]   and they praised their relationship.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.500]   They praised their relationship.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.780]   Proverbs 15, 22 says that plans fail for a lack of counsel,
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.480]   but with many advisors, they succeed.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.740]   Is the person that you're dating in community,
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.640]   is the person that you're dating,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.660]   someone who has other people in their life
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.320]   that makes them kind of a known commodity,
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.060]   it's not some guy who just mysteriously shows up,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.860]   is someone, or is he someone or she someone who's known,
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.340]   walking in the light with other people?
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.260]   And do you know the ways that God is just still at work?
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.940]   'Cause we're all imperfect people, all a work in progress.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.100]   Do you know the ways that God's still at work in his heart,
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.780]   or in her heart, the person that you're dating?
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.220]   Like, do you know that, yeah, hey, Mr. Right turns into
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.020]   Mr. Hulk whenever he doesn't get his way,
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.800]   or Mrs. Right and Mrs. Sweet turns into Mrs. Cha-ching Spend
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.180]   when she gets stressed out?
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.180]   Are you aware, and are others aware,
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.740]   of just the ways that God is at work in her life?
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.460]   You do not have to have perfection,
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.980]   but having the collection of God's people around
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.780]   will protect you and protect them.
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.600]   Is the person that you're dating someone
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.980]   who's a known commodity?
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.920]   Do other Christ followers support the relationship?
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.760]   Number four.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.640]   Number four, the fourth instrument,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.580]   as it relates to making sure you don't trust your feelings.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.580]   The fourth action is to preserve purity,
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.040]   preserve purity, preserve purity in the relationship.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.480]   If you're dating someone,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.000]   that you make sure that you don't introduce sex,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.680]   the Bible says, "Awaken love before it's time."
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   Hebrews 13, verse four says that the marriage bed
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.040]   should be kept pure and marriage honored by everyone.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.880]   First Corinthians six says, "Flee sexual immorality."
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.940]   Every other sin that you commit is different from this one
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.780]   because the person who commits sexual sin
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.540]   sins against themselves.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:00.380]   Flee it.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.200]   You're gonna hurt yourself,
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.380]   you're gonna hurt your dating relationship.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.780]   Preserve purity, the Bible says.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.000]   And I think that one of the reasons this is so crucial
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.620]   is like we said already, like, dude, love is intoxicating.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.860]   Like if you're in love, it's amazing.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.940]   You're like, I love love.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.660]   There's flowers everywhere, I can see 'em.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.540]   It's just, I just feel incredible.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.800]   And when you introduce sex
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.560]   to this already kind of intoxicated, it's amazing.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.920]   You are playing with fire.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.040]   You are putting on blinders.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.520]   It's gonna keep you in a relationship
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.880]   longer than you ever should have been in.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.980]   It's gonna blind you to things that you'll look over
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.980]   'cause you're like, man, just, this is, sex is amazing.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.680]   Sure, we fight all the time, but when we touch,
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.640]   it's like electricity just between us.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.160]   And it's gonna keep you from experiencing
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.960]   the type of dating relationship and future marriage
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.280]   that God wants you to have.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.420]   I think what's happened as a society,
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.260]   and this is so crazy, and most of you won't believe me,
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.260]   but we've moved so far from God's design
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:58.440]   as it relates to sex.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.660]   Like this incredible gift that he gave
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.060]   for the purpose of a man and a woman
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.780]   coming together in marriage, this one context.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.820]   Like in other words, that feels like archaic and old school.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.940]   God's design is that sex would be given
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.620]   for a very specific place, marriage,
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.540]   between one man and one woman who would come together
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.920]   and this incredibly pleasurable thing
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.640]   would be this incredibly powerful bonding agent
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.120]   and would unite them together.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.120]   And that they would experience just nakedness
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.220]   and unashamedness together.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:34.100]   And we live in a culture that has looked at sex
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.040]   and it's like so, it basically has been boiled down
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.800]   that, man, sex is just physical.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.000]   It's like no different than kissing.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.480]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.180]   And the hookup culture and Tinder has totally
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.040]   made this even worse.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.240]   And this incredibly sacred almost gift that God gave
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.600]   because God, here's the truth.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.740]   God wants you to have an amazing sex life.
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.560]   Like unbelievably, crazy banging,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.360]   it's amazing, off the chain.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.340]   That's what God wants for you.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.640]   He made sex, he created it.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.200]   And you hear people be like, man,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.300]   you just gotta stay away from sex, drugs, and rock and roll
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.400]   'cause that's all the devil.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.280]   God's like, I invented sex.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.880]   You can't take that one, that's mine.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.160]   I'm the one who gave it to man.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.400]   I want them to have amazing sex.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.640]   But them devaluing it and thinking it's like,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.040]   it's not that big of a deal, you can do it.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.280]   It's just so commonplace, makes it impossible
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.520]   for them to experience that.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.800]   It's all against the design.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.840]   It's not dissimilar to pineapples.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.220]   And here's what I mean.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.800]   Left turn.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:41.200]   In the 1500s, Christopher Columbus shows up, 1492,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.720]   and he shows up, and I realize it's the 1400s.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.480]   And then he goes back to the New World,
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.280]   and all of a sudden, this new world is introduced.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.000]   Inside of the new world, something was seen
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.600]   for the very first time, pineapple.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.800]   They took it back, this fruit.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.960]   Christopher Columbus shows up, shows up back in Europe,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.680]   and he goes, dude, look at this thing, this is awesome.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.160]   And they go, what is that?
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.920]   And he said, it looks like a pine cone,
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.880]   tastes like an apple, pineapple.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.400]   And they named it the pineapple.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.560]   Here's what was unique about pineapples.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.000]   They became what is known, you can go look it up today,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.280]   the very first luxury item from the New World.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.400]   No one had ever seen anything like this before.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.200]   It was so exclusive, so exotic, so unique.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.960]   It was only for the elite of the elite.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.220]   Like, it was something that you couldn't,
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.200]   most people couldn't afford.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.340]   At the rate that it was going for,
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.120]   if you adjust for inflation,
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.440]   historians say it sold for $8,000 a pineapple.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   Think about that, eight grand.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.840]   Most people would never eat one, would never touch one.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.060]   You wouldn't oftentimes eat them if you bought them.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.880]   You would keep it in your house and just be like,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.480]   dude, look at this, look at this.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.480]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.820]   Mom, I made it, see the pineapple?
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.840]   I mean, if you go, even if you go
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.320]   to St. Paul's Cathedral in London,
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.920]   why is there a giant pineapple on the cathedral?
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.520]   Because it was this symbol of success and luxury
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.860]   and just this incredibly exotic, amazing thing.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.040]   Pineapples today sell for like $1.99.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.640]   The invention of kind of the pineapple plantations
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.560]   and the spread of farming and different technological
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.840]   advances has made it to where pineapples,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.160]   there's nothing special about pineapples.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.800]   You weren't like, oh my gosh, pineapples, that's incredible.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.980]   I saw him, he had a pineapple, he must be successful.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.320]   That doesn't mean any of that to you.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.240]   Because they've become so common
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.560]   that when we look at them, it's nothing special.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.240]   What changed about pineapple?
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.320]   Nothing.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.940]   Just the perception of the world around it did.
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.200]   And in the same way, it's such a perfect analogy
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.680]   for what has happened to sex.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.320]   This incredibly just thing that God gave
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   to be this one exclusive relationship
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.920]   between one man and one woman that would come together
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.160]   without guilt and shame from past relationships,
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.420]   without worrying about, man, am I gonna be compared
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.000]   to her other boyfriends in the past,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.920]   without worrying about like, I hope I have a condom
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.760]   'cause I may get an STD, without worrying
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.760]   about any of those things,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.200]   this incredibly incredible gift
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.240]   that God gave for this one context
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.700]   between one man and one woman has become common,
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.760]   not that big of a deal, and what changed?
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.360]   The perception of it.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.640]   And we live in a culture that is so devalued.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.660]   And in doing so, devaluing sex has so made it so difficult
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.080]   to experience this incredible gift
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.840]   the way that God designed it to work.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.800]   One of the best things you can do if you're dating someone,
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.740]   preserve purity, preserve purity.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.680]   And regardless of your past, you can be a part
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.080]   of changing your present and changing the future,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.840]   saying, I'm gonna preserve purity in this relationship,
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.740]   moving forward, and let God continue to heal.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.200]   And you may be thinking, and this,
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.320]   oh, every time we say this, it like gets pushed back,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.400]   which is so interesting to me, is people will say,
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.120]   well, how do we know if we're sexually compatible then?
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.900]   If you're a man and she's a woman,
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.680]   you know that you're sexually compatible.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.180]   I mean, that's insane.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.360]   And if that's where you're feeling like,
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.200]   no, man, we may not be,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.900]   I don't even wanna get into parts here,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.420]   but if you revisit health class from seventh grade,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.720]   you're gonna know who's sexually compatible with who.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.820]   You don't have to wonder the question of what if we're not,
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.840]   what if we don't enjoy it, and what if we don't?
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.320]   No, if you step into sex, you are going
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.240]   to create what sex always does,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.360]   scars and baggage that you're gonna have,
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.720]   that's not impossible, that Chris can't come in
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.960]   and he can bring healing to,
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   but it's gonna bring about scars and pain
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.160]   that God doesn't want for you to experience.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.120]   To the response of like people go,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   man, well, then how are you gonna know
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.680]   if you're gonna have great sex?
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.720]   You may not.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.960]   But the good news is you got a lifetime.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.360]   When my wife and I, we've been married five years,
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.200]   when we first got married,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.600]   like we both entered into the marriage,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.180]   we had not had sex before.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.240]   And we got into the relationship and it wasn't like,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.280]   dude, this is crazy, unbelievable, oh my gosh.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.600]   It was still, sex is amazing, it's unbelievable,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.400]   best part of your day every time it happens.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.720]   But, (congregation laughing)
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.560]   but it wasn't like, man, this is just,
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.240]   we're gonna write the book after this.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.760]   It was like, man, hey, we're trying to,
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.220]   just because both of us had not had practice.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.880]   But you know, we got a lifetime to have,
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.240]   practice makes perfect, but if you practice before
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.740]   you enter that lifetime, practice makes permanent.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.120]   And the God who loves you says,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.680]   man, wherever you are in your journey,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.560]   today you can begin to pursue and preserve purity.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.800]   Inside of that, number five, and our final one
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   from this instrument idea of trusting not how you feel,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.160]   but trusting the instruments, the principles
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.440]   that God has given us in his word,
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.720]   is today to become the person,
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.620]   the person you're looking for is looking for.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.600]   To spend today becoming the one
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.320]   that the one that you're looking for out there
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.160]   is looking for.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.980]   I know that sounds like, what, is that Inception?
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.000]   What did he just say?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.720]   Become, here's what I mean.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.080]   This comes from a guy named Andy Stanley
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.880]   who wrote a book on this topic itself.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.000]   And today, one of the most practical things you can do
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.920]   is not avoid trying to marry the wrong person,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.440]   but spend today becoming the right person.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.080]   Focus on becoming the person that the person
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.720]   who you want to marry is going to want to marry.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   Like in other words, whatever you,
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.120]   as you think through, like man, you know,
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.480]   Sally's out there and this, or whatever her name will be,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.680]   and she, I hope, is gonna love Jesus.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.080]   She's gonna be, you know, all this other list of things
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   that we add on of she's a supermodel
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.480]   and she's got, you know, an amazing,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.360]   she's amazing at sex, but she's a virgin
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.000]   and she loves to cook and she does all this whole list.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.740]   But whatever that list is,
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.380]   usually for people who love Jesus,
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.720]   it's like, and she's radically in love with Jesus.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.520]   That if you want to marry that person,
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.240]   you gotta spend today becoming the person
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.040]   that someone who's in love with Jesus
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.440]   is going to want to marry.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.280]   Because the truth is, tragically,
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.740]   supermodel Sally, she wouldn't wanna marry you.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.140]   Many of you.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.300]   And it's not because she's like, I don't like,
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.780]   you know, he's overweight
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.040]   or he doesn't have great teeth or whatever.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.140]   It's because they're not someone who looks at you
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.580]   and goes, man, they are madly in love with Jesus.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.100]   And the best thing you can do today is to spend it
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:47.120]   focused on being the one that the someone
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.860]   that you're looking for is looking for.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.300]   How do you do that?
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.020]   You use this season really, really well.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.780]   You live in community with other people
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.700]   of the same gender, same sex that are in your life
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   that hold you accountable.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.800]   Speak into your life.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.960]   You do it by dealing with addictions right now.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.860]   Whether it's pornography,
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.940]   which won't go away when you get married,
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.860]   it will get worse.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.960]   And now you'll have someone else involved.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.300]   Maybe it's an addiction to alcohol.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.580]   Maybe it's an addiction to spending.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.460]   And maybe the most incredible gift you can give
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.260]   to your spouse would be for you to begin to go to regen.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.860]   And you haven't even met your spouse.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.660]   Like you don't even know who they are.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.780]   They're not even on your radar,
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.180]   but you can invest and say, man,
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.340]   I'm gonna give this season to get healthy.
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.300]   I'm gonna use the season well.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.060]   I'm gonna become the person,
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.300]   the person I'm looking for is gonna be looking for.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.580]   Others of you, you're gonna have to step into community
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.220]   and change playmates and change your playgrounds.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.180]   You may have to do,
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.220]   just have follow-up conversations with people
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.260]   who you're holding bitterness against.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.660]   In a way that I'm sure if we heard your story,
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.580]   we'd understand, but you're just holding, it's a parent.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.140]   It's someone who passed, in your past, abused
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.100]   or just wherever someone has come in and hurt you
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.940]   and you just need to work through the process of forgiving
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.020]   so that you're not holding onto that bitterness.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.220]   Some of you may need to just do everything you can
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.900]   to get out of debt so that you're not coming
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.700]   to this relationship going, man,
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.900]   I hope you're gonna be able to pay this off.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.460]   But use the season well, become the person
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.380]   that the person you're looking for is looking for.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.660]   I heard it said this week that the people
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.660]   who have the best I do's are the ones who is singles,
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.340]   spin it saying, I don't.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.500]   The people who have the best I do someday
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.340]   are the ones who two day spin it saying, I don't.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.460]   I'm not gonna date that, I'm not gonna go there,
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.220]   I'm not gonna spend my weekend at that club again.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.020]   I'm not gonna continue to smoke pot and be like,
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.240]   someday I'll grow out of this.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.540]   The people who have the best I do someday
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.980]   are the ones who strive to say, I don't, two day.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.840]   Let me close with this.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:16.020]   We just had like the craziest like last few weeks.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.580]   I feel like I'm like beating a gong
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.860]   and like we've been sleeping on a mattress
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.300]   in the floor for six weeks,
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.820]   on the floor for six weeks kind of thing.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.980]   Like we're like in this house that we just moved into
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.900]   that they're remodeling.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.780]   We have a fridge in our living room, people.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.060]   How crazy is that?
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.460]   And like, it's just like total chaos,
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:34.500]   sleeping on a mattress.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.660]   It's been so hectic and so crazy.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.140]   And we had launch retreat, which was amazing
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.340]   and this incredible weekend.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.500]   And last week, it's the hecticness was still kind of going on
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.780]   and we had this weekend.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.500]   Last week we were like, man, the weekend's gonna come.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.320]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.220]   The weekend finally came and our son gets a fever,
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.380]   103.8 fever.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.300]   And we're like, we gotta go to the doctor.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.160]   We go to the doctor and he tested positive for pneumonia.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:05.020]   It's like, oh my gosh, man, it's like hurricane.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:10.020]   And in all this chaos of life and just the stress
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:14.020]   of kind of the home environment being so chaotic
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.340]   and construction people in there all the time
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.820]   and sleeping on a mattress and now he's got pneumonia.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.420]   And the kind of pneumonia where you're,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.500]   I mean, I guess any pneumonia,
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.180]   but where you're up every three hours
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.780]   giving a medicine kind of thing.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.500]   And in the midst of that, my wife, whose name is Callie,
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.880]   was such a champ.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.340]   Like by far the most godly person in our family is my wife.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.860]   And she's up every three hours.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.700]   She's nurturing, she's caring.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.540]   It's this like mama bear instinct turns on for mothers.
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.380]   And in the midst of all of that, she's not complaining.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:53.020]   She's praying over him, she's singing over him,
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.260]   and she's caring for him.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:35:00.180]   Every week and for the last eight years,
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.140]   there are lots and lots of beautiful women
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.540]   that are a part of the porch.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.460]   Really, really attractive, pretty.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   And I've seen it so many times personally
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.180]   and in marriages that end up taking place
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.980]   where someone will marry someone that's man, smoking hot,
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.060]   but they don't have character.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.300]   And what happens in moments like that?
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.740]   I mean, that's what life is like.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:24.700]   I hope you're not thinking like, man,
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.260]   it's just gonna be this honeymoon and it's amazing.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:28.860]   And all we're doing is either having a romp fest
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.340]   or watching rom-coms together.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.760]   That's not what life is.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.900]   Life just brings this chaos around.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.060]   And if you don't have character,
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.020]   regardless of how smoking hot they are, it will not last.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:44.300]   And they're not someone that you wanna
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.380]   walk through life with.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.140]   The truth for you and for me and for everybody
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.540]   is you don't need a guy on your arm
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.300]   who's just hunk and strong jawline.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.700]   You need a girl who stands there and wears the right dress.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.780]   You need someone to go to war with 'cause life is a war.
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.580]   And you're gonna face it every single day.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.040]   Who are you going to marry?
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.380]   If you really prioritize, man,
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.220]   I just wanna have someone with a huge bustline
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.860]   and not to have character or not have a relationship
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.420]   with Jesus that anchors them in the midst of chaos.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.020]   Who are you gonna trust in?
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.780]   Are you gonna trust in the feelings that you have?
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   And if you do, you're gonna crash the plane,
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.060]   tragically, more tragic or as tragic
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.280]   as JFK Jr. driving into the water himself.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.380]   Who are you gonna trust in?
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.660]   Your feelings?
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.100]   That really you guys are the one couple
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.200]   in the whole universe that really is gonna break the rules
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.620]   that God has set up in his word?
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.220]   That, oh, no, not us, we got a song,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.820]   we got everything going together, we're gonna be great,
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.580]   we're gonna be just fine, it's us against the world.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.100]   It won't work.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:41.380]   And God has given principles clearly in scripture
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.900]   that if you were dating someone and you're saying,
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.580]   man, they don't have that great a character,
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.180]   but he's a trust fund baby, you're gonna have scars.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.340]   That you're dating someone and, man,
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.300]   they may not be a believer,
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.580]   they may not be all in with Jesus,
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:54.940]   but I think I can get 'em there.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.220]   You're not the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.200]   And that's not your job.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.420]   Your job is to follow Jesus and run hard after him.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.860]   And God's timing, he brings that person along.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:10.140]   I know in this room, and I'm gonna close right here,
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.720]   there are some of you who feel like damaged goods.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:19.380]   I know 'em, I have family members who feel that way.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.180]   You feel like if there's a godly guy out there,
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.220]   maybe a godly girl out there who really loves Jesus,
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.220]   who's all in with him,
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.660]   that if he ever looked in your direction,
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.960]   he wouldn't wanna date you.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.540]   He wouldn't wanna be a part of that.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.500]   'Cause you look behind, you got a past.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.180]   A past maybe filled with an abortion,
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.060]   filled with sexual partners, filled with mistakes,
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.780]   one night stands, filled with whatever it is,
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.760]   fill in the blank.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.560]   And I want you to know that regardless of the story
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.540]   that you have, the reason that someone would not,
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.580]   if they are all in with Jesus, want to date you
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.220]   is not because of your past.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.380]   It's because of your present and not running after Christ.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.180]   Regardless of your past, it's not a problem for Jesus.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.620]   And it's not a problem for anyone who loves Jesus.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.620]   It often is a platform that God,
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.540]   when someone says, "Take my past, take my present,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.680]   "take my life," God says,
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:12.160]   "Man, I'm gonna create an amazing platform out of,
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.700]   "and allow you to show how even in the midst of ashes,
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.100]   "I make beautiful things."
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.440]   If you're someone who thinks, "Man, I'm damaged goods,"
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.680]   you've bought a lie.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.940]   And God doesn't ask for you to do away and hide
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.420]   and be ashamed of your past.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.840]   He says, "Will you surrender that to me?
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.340]   "Surrender your present to me, and you'll have life."
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.220]   And I'll write a love story like you've never known,
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.340]   because you have got to know,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.940]   if you're gonna experience being in a relationship
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.300]   with a spouse in a healthy way,
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.260]   they've gotta be someone, and you've gotta be someone
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.820]   who knows the ultimate spouse
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.260]   that they'll be with for all of eternity.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.220]   You and I, marriage, if we have 75 years, my wife and I,
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.660]   if we have 75 years in this life,
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.780]   what is that, a page in the Bible?
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.780]   I mean, ultimately, if you're gonna have a good spouse,
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.620]   or you're gonna be a good spouse,
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.620]   you've gotta know that the story is not about you,
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:58.900]   it's not about me.
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.140]   I mean, think about that.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.580]   Like in all of, like the Bible,
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.780]   it goes through all these different stories.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.260]   75 years we're together, 75 years, it's amazing.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.540]   We made it through a silver, platinum,
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.340]   or whatever anniversary that the Bible would say,
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.340]   this is just one page.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.980]   You're gonna be with that spouse, Jesus,
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.860]   which is what the bride of Christ says,
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.680]   or is called to be a part of this marriage relationship
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.300]   with Christ for all of eternity.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.580]   And if you're gonna marry or have a good marriage
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.540]   in this life, you and the other spouse involved
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.840]   have to know ultimately who their spouse is.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.860]   And it's having that anchor
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.540]   that allows you in the midst of the storm
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.220]   to not focus on your feelings, not crash the plane,
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.980]   but trust in Him and the instruments
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.020]   and the truths that He's given us.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:38.860]   Let me pray.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.380]   Father, thank you that you're a God
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.420]   who shows up to women caught in adultery.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.240]   And you don't condemn 'em,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.700]   but you don't condone what they've done.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.300]   You forgive them.
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.500]   As you modeled for us in John chapter eight,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   I pray for friends in the room
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.140]   who've been running, God, would you make amazing marriages
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.620]   out of my friends here?
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.380]   Would you make the best marriages
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.820]   the city of Dallas has ever seen
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.400]   from friends that are represented inside of this room?
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.460]   But we know that beautiful love stories
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.140]   don't come from having the right flowers and hair color.
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.140]   They come from having the right God that we worship,
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.340]   from knowing what marriage
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.480]   and ultimately all of life is about, which is Jesus.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.580]   Father, I pray for amazing relationships.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.080]   I pray for relationships in this room to break up.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.320]   And I pray that they would,
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.400]   if that be consistent with what your will is,
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.680]   or inconsistent, if the relationship they have
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.880]   is inconsistent with your word,
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.600]   Father, would you take them down,
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.940]   help them trust in you,
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.040]   that you're a God who loves and gives good things
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.800]   and wants great love and relationships for us.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.600]   We worship you now in song, amen.
