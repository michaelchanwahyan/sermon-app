1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,400
 - All right, welcome friends of the room

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,400
 and Fort Worth, Austin, El Paso, Phoenix, Houston,

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,660
 Philly, Cedar Rapids, any of the 16

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,840
 other Ports Alive locations.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,440
 We are continuing this series, Bloodline.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,160
 I'm gonna start by telling a story.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,740
 My son is about to be four years old

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,080
 and he is in this stage of life

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,900
 where he is constantly singing about everything.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,240
 Sometimes he just makes up songs,

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,040
 other times he just like has these little kid CDs

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,080
 they're constantly singing.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,700
 We drive in the car, constantly singing.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,520
 It's like high school musical is our life at all times.

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
 And to the point where my wife will like

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,400
 take little videos of him singing stuff

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,680
 and then he'll ask questions about different things.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,880
 In fact, here's a video of one time recently

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,560
 or in the past week where he's just

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,640
 belting it out in the car,

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,680
 doesn't even know exactly what he's singing.

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,800
 ♪ Oh how I loved you ♪

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,520
 ♪ Because you first loved me ♪

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,280
 - Wait for it.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,520
 ♪ Oh how I loved you ♪

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,320
 - Here's what's funny about that.

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,840
 He has no idea what he's singing.

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 Most of the songs that he sings he has no idea

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,040
 because one thing is for certain,

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 he does not love Jesus yet.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,560
 He is a Christian or he's not a Christian yet.

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,240
 He's a little sinner living in our home.

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,260
 And his little sister is for sure a sinner

35
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,600
 living in our home.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,520
 And hopefully one day he does, but he'll sing these songs.

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
 You know, just kids, they'll pick it up

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,460
 and kind of whatever's playing, they'll sing the songs.

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,400
 And he was listening to a song recently

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,280
 where we were driving in the car

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
 and it's not one that anyone would recognize in here,

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,060
 but it said something about like trusting God.

43
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,120
 And so we asked a question as he'll do often

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
 just 'cause he's like,

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,400
 I don't even know what I'm singing right now.

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,520
 I just like to sing.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,200
 And he asked, what does it mean to trust God?

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,840
 And then as a father, you begin to like play,

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,620
 how do you answer a three-year-old

50
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,880
 on what it actually means,

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,320
 like what the word trust means

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,040
 and what that actually explains.

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,620
 And I begin to like try to put into words

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,080
 and give him like, man, it means that we live

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,480
 according to what he says, we listen and obey.

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,240
 And this was either a great parenting moment

57
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
 or a terrible one.

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,960
 Oh, listen and obey like Kanye's Chick-fil-A song.

59
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,460
 And I was like, yeah, kind of like Kanye's Chick-fil-A song

60
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,920
 and began to explain what does it mean to trust God?

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
 And I gave a couple answers.

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,160
 And as I thought about that question,

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,600
 I don't know that there's gonna ever be a moment in his life

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
 where he asks a more significant question than that.

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,500
 I don't know that anyone in this room

66
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,780
 could ask a more important question than that.

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,920
 What does it look like and what does it mean to trust God?

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,440
 Although the Bible, the Bible indicates

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,520
 that if you can't answer that question correctly,

70
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,520
 it's gonna have significant implications in this life

71
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,980
 and in the life to come or in eternity.

72
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,780
 And yet it's one of those phrases that, you know,

73
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,500
 trusting God or having faith or believing

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,640
 will throw out there

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,340
 and people will use it in different ways.

76
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,460
 And often they'll use it in ways

77
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,100
 that don't exactly align with the Bible

78
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,060
 where people are like, hey dude,

79
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,400
 this year, 2019 has been terrible.

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,820
 2020, I'm telling you, it's coming.

81
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,040
 I'm just believing and having faith for great things.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,620
 It's gonna be amazing.

83
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,420
 And that is not necessarily a bad thing,

84
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,180
 but that would be closer to hoping for great things.

85
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,260
 When the Bible talks about faith,

86
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,540
 it talks about different aspects

87
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,180
 and that as believers, you and I are called

88
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,100
 if we're gonna experience a relationship with God

89
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,940
 to walk by faith.

90
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,500
 So what does it mean to walk by faith or to trust God?

91
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,940
 What does that actually look like?

92
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,900
 And so tonight I wanna explore

93
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,540
 as we continue the series Bloodline,

94
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,020
 looking at the father of faith,

95
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,980
 where we learn inside of his life, his name was Abraham,

96
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,500
 what it looks like to trust God.

97
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,100
 True faith and trusting God

98
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,400
 are synonymous with one another biblically.

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,140
 That to trust is to have faith.

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,100
 And like I said, this question is at the heart

101
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,220
 of whether or not you will spend eternity with God.

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,140
 How you answer this question

103
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,380
 and whether or not you get this answer right

104
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,140
 will impact whether or not you spend eternity

105
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,260
 and has significant implications

106
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,080
 for how you experience life in this world.

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,460
 How you sleep at night, the peace you experience,

108
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,840
 the type of marriage that you're gonna have,

109
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,540
 all of which hinge on having true faith.

110
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,980
 So tonight we're gonna look at the father of faith

111
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,660
 and explore as we continue this series Bloodline.

112
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,500
 If you're just joining us or you missed last week,

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,480
 here's what we kicked off.

114
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,000
 We are tracing the bloodline of Jesus

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,860
 through the Old Testament.

116
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,700
 So over the next four weeks,

117
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,740
 we're looking at the main message of the Old Testament.

118
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,140
 If you've ever wondered what's the big picture story

119
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,900
 of the Bible, you are about to get it

120
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,220
 as we trace through the Old Testament.

121
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,020
 Last week, we kicked off with Adam and his girl Eve.

122
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,620
 They're in the garden, everything perfect.

123
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,000
 That lasted five minutes.

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,740
 They sinned against God, everything broken.

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,940
 And from there, they had kids, they had kids,

126
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,900
 they had kids, and really things didn't get worse.

127
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,060
 And the sin that entered the world

128
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,420
 whenever Adam and Eve disobeyed

129
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
 was passed on to their kids and passed on to their kids,

130
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,500
 passed on to their kids.

131
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,940
 And the storyline continues,

132
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,140
 and we're gonna pick it up with Abraham

133
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,380
 and kind of what's happened in between

134
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,180
 is just humanity's continued to fill up the earth.

135
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,580
 There was Noah and the flood.

136
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,180
 That was a pretty crazy deal.

137
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,580
 And that took place in Genesis chapter 12

138
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,860
 through Genesis 22.

139
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,940
 We are introduced to Abraham.

140
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,340
 And it's as though God says, just like I promised

141
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,020
 after Adam and Eve fell and sin entered the world,

142
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,920
 I'm gonna enact a rescue mission to save humanity.

143
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,020
 And tonight, we're gonna look at the next sequence

144
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,140
 or the next part in that rescue mission

145
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,280
 through the story of Abraham.

146
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,540
 Here's what we gotta know about Abe.

147
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,020
 Abe gets 10 chapters in the book of Genesis.

148
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,220
 The story of creation gets two.

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,660
 The story of sin entering the world gets one.

150
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,460
 Noah essentially gets like two and a half.

151
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,020
 So for somebody to get 10 chapters was a really big deal.

152
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,780
 Like Abraham and the Jewish faith,

153
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
 Father Abraham had many sons,

154
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,800
 and Father Abraham was a significant, significant deal.

155
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,420
 There probably is no greater or more significant figure

156
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,620
 for Jewish, those of the Jewish faith today.

157
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,660
 And we're gonna look at his story

158
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,580
 because God in his relationship with Abraham

159
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,380
 gives us an indication of really the rescue plan

160
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,180
 that he's unleashed for all of us.

161
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,420
 He gives us also the answer of what true faith looks like.

162
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,060
 So we're gonna be in chapter 15 of Genesis.

163
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,240
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,020
 If not, it'll be up on the screen.

165
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,100
 Or as always, you can pick up, if you're in Dallas,

166
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,220
 a Bible at the Welcome Center that is our gift to you.

167
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,820
 So we'll start in verse one of chapter 15

168
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,460
 as we look at three marks of true faith.

169
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,940
 Let me set up what has happened from 12 to 15.

170
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,740
 God shows up to Abraham, raises his hand,

171
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,420
 "Hey, Abe, I'm starting something with you.

172
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,600
 "I need you to pick up, and I want you to move your family.

173
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,160
 "I'm gonna take you to a promised land that I have for you.

174
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,460
 "I'm gonna make you into a great nation."

175
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,380
 And he's about 75 years old when that happens.

176
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,400
 About a decade goes by, and he is not a great nation.

177
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,260
 He doesn't even have a kid.

178
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,240
 And God shows up and says this.

179
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,060
 "After this, the word of the Lord came to Abram."

180
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,180
 He's about to have a name change in two chapters,

181
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,460
 and I'll explain what that means,

182
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,120
 but same dude, Abram, Abraham.

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,760
 "And he came with a vision.

184
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,900
 "Do not be afraid, Abram.

185
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,840
 "I am your shield and your very great reward.

186
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,940
 "But Abraham said, 'Sovereign Lord,

187
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,040
 "'what can you give me since I remain childless?

188
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,800
 "'And the one who will inherit my estate

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,060
 "'is Eleazar of Damascus.'"

190
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,620
 Poor Eleazar, man.

191
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,300
 "And Abraham said, 'You have given me no children,

192
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,800
 "'so a servant in my household will be my heir.'

193
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
 "And the word of the Lord came to him and said,

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,180
 "'This man will not be your heir,

195
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,420
 "'but a son whose your own flesh and blood will be your heir.'

196
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,480
 "And he took him outside and he said,

197
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,200
 "'Look up at the sky and count the stars,

198
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,020
 "'if indeed you can count them.'

199
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,500
 "And then he said to him, 'So shall your offspring be.'"

200
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,100
 He goes out, takes Abraham outside,

201
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,220
 says, "Look up at the stars."

202
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,140
 This wasn't like stars in Dallas where you're like,

203
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,900
 "Oh man, is that one star right there?

204
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,340
 "No, that's a plane."

205
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,740
 This was like if you've ever been out in places

206
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,660
 where there's no smog or no industry or any of that,

207
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,340
 you look up and you're like, bam, lights everywhere.

208
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,220
 And he sees, that's gonna be the descendants that you have.

209
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,460
 I've even been told recently this week

210
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,460
 that there are more stars in the galaxy

211
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,500
 they've accounted for

212
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,020
 than there are grains of sand on the planet.

213
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,380
 I don't know if that's true, but that's crazy.

214
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,940
 Either way, it's clearly God communicating,

215
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,500
 I am going to make your descendants more vast

216
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,860
 than you can even understand.

217
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,260
 And Abraham in response to that,

218
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,320
 looking up at the night sky, it says,

219
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,460
 "Believed the Lord and he credited to him as righteousness."

220
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,900
 That Abraham heard the promise of God

221
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,700
 as a 80 plus year old man,

222
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,980
 that he's gonna have a son.

223
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,700
 And he believed that what God said would happen.

224
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,020
 And in that moment, God, it says,

225
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,900
 credited to him righteousness.

226
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,740
 What's righteousness?

227
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,660
 It's a really churchy word.

228
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,500
 It's just a word that means

229
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 having a right relationship with God.

230
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,000
 In a moment, think about this.

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,520
 This is what would set apart Abraham

232
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,580
 and really the Christian faith

233
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,820
 from every other worldview and world religion that there is.

234
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,860
 In a moment, he believed what God said

235
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,760
 and what God promised would happen.

236
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,100
 And in that moment, he was declared righteous.

237
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,480
 You have a right relationship for all time now, Abraham,

238
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,340
 because of you believing God

239
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,540
 and believing the promise that he made.

240
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,500
 The first mark of really true faith

241
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,060
 is that true faith trusts in the promises of God.

242
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,820
 True faith trusts in the promises of God.

243
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,700
 As it relates to the Bible,

244
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,100
 there's a lot of promises that God makes.

245
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,260
 And as someone who has true faith,

246
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,100
 if you're gonna have that,

247
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,160
 it is someone who looks at the faith

248
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,260
 or looks at the promises that God has made and says,

249
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,060
 "Man, I'm believing that God said that's true."

250
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,820
 Abraham looked up and in a moment was declared righteous.

251
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,940
 Three times in the New Testament, this verse right here,

252
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,660
 it gets a significant verse.

253
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,700
 Paul would be like, "Dude, this is a game changer.

254
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,280
 "This is what Christianity,

255
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,300
 "at the heart of Christianity is the message of.

256
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,960
 "It is not your behavior

257
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,340
 "that gives you right standing with God

258
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,720
 "or right relationship.

259
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,880
 "It is your belief.

260
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,100
 "And your belief always impacts your behavior.

261
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,040
 "But the heart of the New Testament,

262
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,060
 "the message of Christianity is not,

263
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,980
 "Hey, good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell,

264
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,380
 "just really work on being a good person.

265
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,140
 "It is that forgiven people go to heaven.

266
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,980
 "And there is only one way to get forgiveness.

267
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,900
 "That is by believing and putting your trust in Jesus

268
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,200
 "as the payment for your sin.

269
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,840
 "Jesus showed up, that he gave his life,

270
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,540
 "dying on the cross, rose from the grave

271
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,380
 "to pay for your sin.

272
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,160
 "And in the moment that you, like Abraham,

273
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
 "believed God and the promise that he made,

274
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,940
 "in the moment that you believe God's promise to you,

275
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,100
 "that you can have eternal life,

276
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,280
 "not by being a good person

277
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,180
 "or trying to earn your way to heaven,

278
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,080
 "but by putting your faith or trusting,

279
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,060
 "not in how good of a person you are,

280
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,760
 "but in Jesus and what he did on the cross,

281
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,080
 "you, like Abraham, in a moment are declared righteous.

282
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,240
 "Unlike any other worldview that there is out there,

283
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
 "that you don't earn your way to God.

284
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,020
 "And Abraham, the father of faith,

285
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,580
 "this was initiated with him."

286
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,480
 John picked up the idea of the promise

287
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,860
 that God has made to you.

288
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,000
 And anyone in this room who in a moment believes it,

289
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,360
 you are declared righteous.

290
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,440
 And he said this in John chapter three,

291
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,840
 verse 16 and 17, verses you've probably heard before.

292
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,800
 "For God so loved the world

293
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,940
 "that he gave his one and only son,

294
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,940
 "that whoever believes in him shall not perish,

295
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,200
 "but have eternal life.

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
 "God did not send his son into the world

297
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,760
 "to condemn the world, but to save the world.

298
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,320
 "Whoever believes in him is not condemned,

299
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
 "but whoever does not believe stands condemned already

300
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,780
 "because they have not believed

301
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,520
 "in the name of God's one and only son."

302
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,160
 There is only one way to have a relationship with God.

303
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
 And just like Abraham, in a moment, look at the night sky,

304
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
 believe God, declared righteous.

305
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,840
 So with you and I, true faith,

306
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
 trust in the promise of God,

307
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,760
 that in a moment that you put your faith,

308
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
 not in how good of a person you are,

309
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,040
 but in what God did, everything changes.

310
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,260
 What's crazy is we live in a world

311
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,200
 that communicates anything other than this.

312
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,040
 Constantly, people are like,

313
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
 "Dude, hey, if you wanna have a relationship with God,

314
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,120
 "you need to earn your way, you need to be a good person,

315
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
 "you need to show up at church,

316
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,160
 "probably need to pay your taxes every now and then,

317
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,480
 "don't kill anybody, and you're probably good."

318
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,140
 I mean, it's one of the most widely spread beliefs

319
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,680
 that there is, that God who's out there,

320
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,020
 as long as I'm relatively good, I'm not Hitler,

321
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,700
 I'm probably going to heaven.

322
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,040
 And it is nuts.

323
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,600
 And the Bible communicates something very different.

324
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,320
 It communicates that good works don't work,

325
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,360
 and good works will never work

326
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,800
 to get you in a relationship with God.

327
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
 And some of you guys, you're listening to me right now,

328
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,080
 and you're not even like,

329
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,400
 it's not even settling in on you.

330
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,840
 Like, this was your first time in church in a while,

331
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
 and you're like, "Dude, did he just say good works?"

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
 Like, God isn't out there for me

333
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
 to just like change my behavior.

334
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,060
 No, God didn't come to make bad people good,

335
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,700
 he came to bring dead people alive.

336
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,960
 And the only way that that happens,

337
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,180
 the only way that you get eternal life

338
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,120
 is by putting your trust not in how good of a person you are,

339
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,860
 but in what Jesus did on the cross,

340
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,120
 because good works don't work.

341
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,960
 It's like this.

342
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,240
 A couple weeks ago, I got sick,

343
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,960
 and I went to the doctor, thought it was the flu,

344
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,640
 and you go in, and you kinda get all the swabs

345
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,460
 and all the tests,

346
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,480
 and you're just hoping for like some relief.

347
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,120
 And she does the test, runs it,

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,160
 and she's like, "Well, we'll let you know,

349
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,540
 "but hey, here's a prescription for a Z-Pak,

350
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,880
 "and here's a steroid, and here's some other antibiotics.

351
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
 "And we'll let you know in a couple days

352
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,960
 "if this is bacterial or viral."

353
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,240
 And hopefully, if it's bacterial, or if it is bacterial,

354
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,540
 you know, Z-Pak is an antibiotic,

355
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,840
 so that'll take it down, and you'll be all good.

356
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
 But if it's viral, it's gotta run its course.

357
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,020
 There's nothing man-made that can cure a virus,

358
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,680
 which is kinda crazy, honestly.

359
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,560
 Feels like we should double down

360
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,440
 on the medical field on that.

361
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,460
 But there's nothing man-made that can cure a virus,

362
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,460
 but there is something man-made that can cure an antibiotic.

363
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,440
 When sin entered the world,

364
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,720
 it was like a virus that is more deadly and more pervasive

365
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,580
 and spread wider and faster and farther and more deeply

366
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,480
 than any other virus that has ever existed.

367
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,600
 And just like as it relates to your health,

368
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,280
 there is no antibiotic or no man-made thing

369
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,160
 that can cure a medical virus.

370
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,800
 So there is no man-made action

371
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
 that can cure the virus of sin.

372
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
 It has to be outside of this world.

373
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,640
 And anything that you do is not going to earn you

374
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,380
 into a relationship with God through your behavior,

375
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,720
 through your not having sex, through abstaining from sex,

376
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
 through having a good past, through you paying a bunch of,

377
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,720
 you know, trying to tie to the church

378
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
 to make up for whatever mistakes that you have

379
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,140
 in your present or in your past.

380
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,640
 The Bible says there is only one way

381
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,240
 to have right standing with God.

382
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,840
 And some of you tragically do not believe me.

383
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,400
 And with all of my heart, I am pleading you to understand,

384
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,800
 you will spend eternity in hell

385
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,440
 if you do not put your faith in Jesus.

386
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,200
 Not if you try to be good for him.

387
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,760
 If you do not put your faith solely,

388
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,060
 God, I'm not a good person.

389
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,600
 You alone are the only reason

390
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,120
 I can have a relationship with you.

391
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,480
 And if I'm gonna spend eternity with you,

392
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 it's not 'cause I earned it

393
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,460
 despite all the different ways

394
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,960
 that I try to live in line with what you want.

395
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,700
 I do not deserve it.

396
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,920
 And yet you gave your life for me.

397
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,000
 And so I accept the free gift that you offered me.

398
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 That alone gives anyone a right relationship

399
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
 or the righteousness that God says.

400
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,360
 And in that moment where you just got,

401
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,980
 I'm totally dependent on you, I believe you,

402
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,500
 you are declared righteous forever.

403
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,940
 True faith always involves trusting in the promises of God.

404
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,860
 It is not a perfection.

405
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,820
 Like here's what's crazy.

406
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,000
 Abe is, like we look at Abraham

407
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
 and I don't know what you know about Abraham,

408
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,720
 but a lot of times you can read these Bible stories

409
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,160
 and be like, oh man, this guy, he's just amazing.

410
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,820
 He's a hero of the faith.

411
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,320
 Abraham did some awesome things,

412
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,880
 but he also didn't have the perfect past.

413
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
 Like two points in the story,

414
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
 if you read the story of Abraham,

415
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,520
 we don't have time to go into it.

416
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,760
 At two different points,

417
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,700
 he finds himself in the exact scenario

418
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,400
 where there's this like foreign king

419
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,840
 that they kind of enter into his town

420
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,120
 and he's walking up and he's there with his wife

421
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,120
 and he's like, oh dang, my wife, she is fine.

422
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,060
 And these guys are gonna try to kill me.

423
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,260
 And so they get with my wife.

424
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,780
 So hey, Sarah is his wife's name.

425
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,660
 Here's what we're gonna do.

426
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,500
 Let's just tell him you're my sister, you know,

427
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,160
 and that'll be cool.

428
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,460
 And they won't kill me.

429
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,560
 And that's always a win.

430
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,540
 And you know, it'll be great.

431
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,940
 So they go into the town.

432
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,500
 The first guy is the Pharaoh.

433
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,020
 And Pharaoh was like, oh dude, who is that?

434
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,320
 That's Sarah girl is fine,

435
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,220
 which is crazy 'cause she's also 75.

436
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,780
 So, you know, Pharaoh, you do you.

437
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,140
 And he goes up and he's like, oh man,

438
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,060
 it's your sister, dude.

439
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,220
 Well, let's have him over.

440
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,300
 And Sarah, I'd love to get to know you.

441
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,140
 You know what I'm saying?

442
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,620
 Listen, I'm in older ladies and this is my thing.

443
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,700
 And they spend time together.

444
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,340
 And then it shows that God shows up to Pharaoh

445
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,260
 and he's like, hey, because you've taken another man's wife,

446
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,100
 I'm gonna kill you.

447
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,940
 And Pharaoh's like, what?

448
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,640
 And why Abe, did you lie to me?

449
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,900
 And so Pharaoh basically is like,

450
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,100
 hey, you guys need to get out of here and leave.

451
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,160
 And the same thing three chapters later

452
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,300
 happens again with another guy.

453
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,780
 Where Abe, this is just his thing,

454
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,940
 goes in, tells his wife, man,

455
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,940
 I think they're gonna kill me.

456
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,340
 And so let's do the whole like sister act thing again.

457
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,620
 And it happens again.

458
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,320
 I mean, I think all of us would agree

459
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,100
 the ideal husband does not pimp out his wife twice,

460
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,020
 let alone one time.

461
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,040
 If that wasn't enough, there's another place in Abraham,

462
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,840
 like this storyline of his faith

463
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,540
 where he's not sure how God is gonna show up and move

464
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,180
 and God's promised him, hey, I'm gonna give you a son.

465
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,060
 And he's only getting older and older.

466
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,500
 And Sarah's only getting older and older.

467
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,300
 And she's like, Sarah says, hey,

468
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,360
 God's gonna give us a son.

469
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,060
 You know what, I don't think it's gonna be through me.

470
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,500
 You should sleep with the maid.

471
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,900
 Dude, you should read your Bible.

472
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
 This is in the Bible.

473
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,220
 Where she says to her husband,

474
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,340
 hey, you should sleep with the maid, Hagar.

475
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,100
 And Abraham is like, I guess I'll take one for the team.

476
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,140
 And he goes to sleep.

477
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,100
 (congregation laughing)

478
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,460
 This woman commits adultery.

479
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,620
 And yet God didn't give up on him.

480
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,220
 It was only by grace or undeserved favor

481
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,900
 and him believing and trusting in the promise of God.

482
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,580
 It wasn't because he had a perfect past

483
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,940
 or was a perfect person.

484
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,100
 It is because he trusted.

485
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,380
 And if you have a right relationship with God,

486
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,980
 it won't be because you have a perfect past or present.

487
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,780
 It'll be because you trust in Jesus

488
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,860
 and his promise that was made

489
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,500
 that anyone who believes in him

490
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,700
 and his payment for their sin will have eternal life.

491
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
 So the first mark of true faith

492
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,620
 is that it trusts in the promises of God.

493
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,500
 As Christians, it is the promise

494
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,980
 that only through Christ we can have eternal life.

495
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,020
 And the second mark we get in chapter 17 of Abraham's story

496
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,340
 where several things have gone by.

497
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,660
 It's just so many things, so many rich parts of his story.

498
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,740
 But basically God shows up again and he's 99 years old,

499
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,140
 still doesn't have any kids.

500
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,980
 Just think about that.

501
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,940
 And God is like, hey, I promise through you

502
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,900
 and his wife's like 10 years younger,

503
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,660
 I threw you and her, your 90 year old wife,

504
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
 you are gonna have a baby.

505
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,220
 And God shows up and says this.

506
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,020
 Verse five of chapter 17.

507
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,840
 "No longer will you be called Abram," God speaking.

508
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,260
 "Your name will be Abraham.

509
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,480
 "For I have made you the father of many nations.

510
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,900
 "I will make you fruitful

511
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,620
 "and I will make nations out of you.

512
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,340
 "Kings will come from you."

513
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,160
 Abraham is a word that just means father of many nations.

514
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,220
 So God shows up, says, hey dude, good to see you again.

515
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,660
 Got another thing I'd like you to do.

516
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,420
 I want you to change your name.

517
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,940
 I want you to change it from Abram,

518
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,080
 which just means kind of like exalted dad,

519
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,660
 to father of many nations,

520
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,760
 despite the fact that you don't have any kids.

521
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,700
 And he's not done and then he says this.

522
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,780
 "God also said, as for your wife Sarai,

523
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,180
 "you are no longer to call her Sarai.

524
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,140
 "Her name will be Sarah,

525
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,420
 "which means mother of many nations.

526
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,080
 "I will bless her and I will surely give you a son by her.

527
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,520
 "I will bless her so that she will be

528
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,420
 "the mother of nations.

529
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,540
 "Kings of people will come from her."

530
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,340
 Think about this interaction.

531
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,340
 You got a 99-year-old dude, you got a 90-year-old woman.

532
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,380
 Abraham's out, hanging out, doing whatever,

533
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,300
 you know, what you did back then.

534
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,240
 He's riding his camel around, hanging out.

535
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,180
 God shows up, he's like, hey, gotta meet again.

536
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,380
 I know I promised you 24 years ago

537
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,300
 that you're gonna have a son.

538
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,340
 And you were old then.

539
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,940
 Like you were 75, now you're 99, you're still waiting.

540
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,620
 Here's what I want you to do.

541
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,980
 I've got something for you.

542
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,100
 And Abe's gotta be thinking, is it a son?

543
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,860
 No, I've got a name change that I'd like you to do.

544
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,940
 And from now on, you're not going by Abraham anymore.

545
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,640
 I want you to go by essentially Big Papa.

546
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,040
 That's where you, I mean, that's essentially what it is.

547
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,460
 Hey, you're the father, I mean, imagine that.

548
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,220
 You're 99 years old and God's like, hey,

549
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,500
 you know, I know we're pretty late in the game here,

550
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,200
 but love to suggest a name change.

551
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,060
 And Sarah is gonna be Big Mama.

552
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,860
 So you got Big Papa, Big Mama.

553
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,780
 What did that conversation look like

554
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,020
 at the dinner table that night with Sarah?

555
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,860
 God, you know, they're sitting down and he's like,

556
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,540
 dude, God showed up to me today.

557
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,660
 And she's like, well, we've been waiting 25 years.

558
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,660
 Yeah, we didn't get the son, but he did have a message.

559
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,740
 He would like you to go by Big Mama from now on.

560
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,700
 Think about that.

561
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,940
 Before he ever had a son,

562
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,300
 God said, I want you to change your name.

563
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,460
 That's how much of a reality

564
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,820
 the fact that you're gonna be the father of many nations is.

565
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,100
 Take it to the bank, change your name, Abraham.

566
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,700
 How did his interactions with his neighbors go?

567
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,620
 Bill's coming over, asking to borrow the lawnmower,

568
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,740
 whatever exchange they had, and they're like,

569
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,020
 Abraham, hey, I'd love to borrow that thing.

570
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,580
 And he's like, actually, from now on, I will be Abraham,

571
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,540
 father of many nations is what I should be called.

572
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,900
 Think all of those things happened

573
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,500
 that he's having to tell people from now on, guys,

574
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,140
 I would like to go by father of many nations.

575
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,380
 But Abraham, you don't have a son.

576
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,580
 You don't have any children.

577
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,260
 I still would like to go by Big Papa.

578
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,220
 And I love it when you call me that.

579
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,160
 So, thank you.

580
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,980
 It's true.

581
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,900
 What does that have to do with true faith?

582
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,180
 True faith involves embracing God's identity for you.

583
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,380
 True faith involves embracing who God says that you are.

584
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,220
 Abraham, or Abram means exalted father.

585
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,860
 It was basically a word that was synonymous with like,

586
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,600
 his dad basically was going,

587
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,060
 great dad would be another way of saying it.

588
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,140
 So his dad named his son, great dad,

589
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,580
 whether it was about him being a great dad,

590
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,820
 or his son, you know, naming, hope Abraham's a great dad,

591
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,580
 all about the past, his dad or the present.

592
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,700
 Abraham is all about the future,

593
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,260
 all about who God says that you are,

594
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,100
 even if you don't feel like it, even if you can't see it,

595
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,400
 this is who you are and who you will be for all time.

596
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,420
 In the same way, God has given identities to you and to me,

597
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,740
 if you're a follower of Christ,

598
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,140
 that you may not always feel like it,

599
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,420
 and it takes walking by faith today,

600
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,780
 and not trusting in how you feel,

601
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,300
 or what you did, or what you think,

602
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,020
 but trusting in who God says that you are,

603
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,260
 even when you don't see it, like Abraham had to trust,

604
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,840
 man, I'm the father of many nations,

605
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,380
 even though I don't have any kids.

606
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,220
 They were coming.

607
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,260
 And God has called you, hey, you are righteous.

608
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,940
 If you are in Christ, there have been titles

609
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,140
 and things that have switched and your identity has changed.

610
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,820
 You are righteous, pure, no matter what you did today,

611
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,980
 no matter what your sexual purity looks like.

612
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,300
 Listen to me, if you're a Christian,

613
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,140
 this is nuts.

614
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,580
 You are as white as snow, the Psalms say,

615
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,940
 that God has taken your sin,

616
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,220
 and it was like Scarlet, he's washed it white as snow,

617
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,220
 that whatever you've done, you are as pure as Jesus is.

618
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,060
 Think about that.

619
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,940
 And I'm talking to you, like if you've trusted in Christ,

620
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,500
 and today you looked at pornography,

621
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 Jesus says, you are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.

622
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,740
 2 Corinthians 5, verse 21.

623
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,460
 If you're living in a way that you know is wrong,

624
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,820
 and you're a follower of Jesus,

625
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,260
 you have believed and put your faith only in him.

626
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,940
 You have the righteousness of Jesus.

627
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,340
 You are a child of God.

628
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,940
 Your identity is so wrapped up in that.

629
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,580
 And you know what takes faith?

630
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,100
 Just like it took Abraham faith to believe,

631
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,020
 God, I'm supposed to go by the,

632
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,620
 I'm the father of many nations.

633
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,260
 To believe that what God says about you

634
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,820
 is what is most true about you.

635
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,820
 You are holy, you are his, you are sealed, you're secure.

636
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,060
 And listen to me, if you're a believer in Jesus,

637
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,060
 only believers, nothing, anyone, no sin,

638
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,260
 nothing can separate you from Jesus.

639
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,140
 Every addiction in this room,

640
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,220
 for anyone who's put their faith in Christ, will fall.

641
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,060
 Eventually, it'll all pass away

642
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,540
 because Jesus has won the victory, you are his.

643
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,300
 And today, we like Abraham, walk by faith

644
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,580
 and trusting that man who God says I am is who I am,

645
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,860
 even when I don't feel like it.

646
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,540
 Like my wife and I, when we got married, something happened.

647
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,940
 We got married, came together, and there was a name change.

648
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,060
 Her last name was Callie Vines,

649
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,780
 or her maiden name was Vines.

650
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,700
 We got married, she became Callie Marvin.

651
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,020
 There was a name change, her identity shifted.

652
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,660
 And that came with all different types of ramifications

653
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,420
 from this new covenant forming and new relationship forming

654
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,580
 where we began to live together, we became one,

655
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,420
 our decisions were impacted with one another.

656
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,740
 Now, here's the deal.

657
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,340
 Do you think there's ever a moment in marriage

658
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,380
 where it's possible?

659
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,020
 Like I'm just talking about any marriage,

660
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,900
 where somebody could wake up and not feel married?

661
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,760
 Yes, of course.

662
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,980
 Someone could wake up and be like, you know what?

663
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,500
 I feel just like I did like a month before we got married.

664
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,260
 I don't know that I feel anything different.

665
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,500
 And yet, through a new covenant,

666
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,400
 something clearly has changed.

667
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,380
 In the same way, when you became a believer in Christ,

668
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,220
 your identity like Abraham switched and shifted.

669
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,180
 And today, part of faith is not relying on how you feel,

670
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,740
 whatever enemy lies you may believe, whatever shame, guilt,

671
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,200
 not allowing your past to define you,

672
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,660
 not even allowing your present to define you,

673
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,880
 but allowing what God says about you

674
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,680
 to be the characteristics and the qualities

675
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,220
 and the truth about who you are.

676
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,520
 This is why this matters so much.

677
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,920
 And I'm gonna just put up some of these

678
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
 for you guys to hold on to,

679
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,280
 or we'll even put on our Insta stories

680
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,120
 so you can take a screenshot

681
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,560
 and you can put it on your phone.

682
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 I don't know, next to what you believe about God,

683
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,620
 I don't know that there's a more significant thing

684
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,940
 that's gonna shape your life

685
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,180
 than what you believe about yourself,

686
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,780
 who you see when you look in the mirror,

687
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,220
 how you think about yourself.

688
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,020
 I don't know that there's a more significant thing

689
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,380
 that's gonna shape who you become,

690
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,380
 how you handle your work, where you find your value.

691
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,700
 Like, candidly, let me just be honest

692
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,860
 with some of you girls.

693
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,700
 The reason why you tolerate such dysfunctional men

694
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,340
 is because you have a really low view of yourself.

695
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
 And you put up with it, and you're like,

696
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,220
 this guy cheats on me, but he keeps being nice,

697
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,540
 and I'm okay with it, and we get back together.

698
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,260
 And that, heartbreakingly,

699
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,660
 is because you have a low view of yourself.

700
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,620
 You don't have the correct view and lens on you

701
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,140
 that God has on you, that you are a daughter of the king.

702
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,000
 And that there's a God in heaven who says,

703
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,860
 you are mine, you are pure, you are not damaged goods.

704
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,500
 I don't care if there's an abortion in your past.

705
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,100
 I don't care what sexual sin is in your past.

706
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,540
 I don't care what sexual sin is in your present.

707
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,100
 You're mine, and he has no claim over you.

708
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,440
 And the reason why you keep going back

709
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,220
 like a dog to its vomit to that messed up,

710
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,740
 broken relationship with that guy

711
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,780
 you know is no good for you

712
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,380
 is because you have a low view of yourself.

713
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,300
 And the degree to which you're gonna tolerate

714
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,260
 dysfunctional, not God-honoring men

715
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,460
 is related to what you think about yourself.

716
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,820
 And what you believe and how you see.

717
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,260
 Same thing with guys.

718
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,820
 I mean, the reason why so many of us can be tempted

719
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,460
 to like, man, I'm gonna give my life to corporate America

720
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,020
 because I think that my worth and my value

721
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,980
 come from what I do, how much I make,

722
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,540
 the job that I have, how fast I can climb

723
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,380
 the corporate ladder.

724
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,420
 And so I'll put up with whatever they ask of me at work

725
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,440
 as long as it keeps increasing my paycheck,

726
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,760
 as long as I keep getting higher,

727
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,060
 'cause you are so obsessed

728
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,000
 with what everyone else thinks of you.

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,660
 And you find your identity and value

730
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,760
 in how much you make in your bank account.

731
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,520
 Because you have not actually believed

732
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,780
 and trusted men who Jesus says I am

733
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,960
 is infinitely more valuable.

734
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,560
 I don't serve my boss in order to hopefully

735
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,600
 get some raise in promotion.

736
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,320
 I serve him because he's a human,

737
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,500
 and God has put me on this planet to love and to serve

738
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,540
 and to work for my boss, whoever they are,

739
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,260
 as though I'm working for the Lord.

740
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,200
 And I'm gonna leverage any opportunity I can,

741
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,580
 hopefully someday, to share the gospel with this dude.

742
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,380
 Because your identity is too wrapped up.

743
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,140
 And candidly, I hear it all the time

744
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,360
 of guys being like, dude, I'm just afraid

745
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,980
 if I share the gospel, share my faith at work,

746
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,460
 it's gonna cost me or I won't get the promotion.

747
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,440
 And you have bought lies about what matters,

748
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,560
 about who you are.

749
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,620
 And walking my faith involves trusting

750
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,780
 that what God says about me is the thing

751
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,940
 that is most true about me.

752
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,620
 There's a slide that our team put together

753
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,940
 of some of these, and some of you guys,

754
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,380
 you can either take a picture of this

755
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,340
 or hold onto this, but you have got to

756
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,420
 have a death grip on who you are.

757
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,500
 This will define and shape how you see yourself,

758
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,820
 how you see life, who you date, who you tolerate.

759
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,260
 And you gotta know, man, I'm a child of God.

760
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
 I'm a member of his church.

761
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,740
 I'm a citizen of heaven above anything else

762
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,980
 that I'm a piece of God's workmanship

763
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,520
 or poetry that he spun his creation.

764
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,020
 That I'm a new creation, a minister of God,

765
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,700
 justified, righteous, and there's so many others.

766
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,140
 I'm secure in his hand, and nothing

767
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,020
 can separate me from him.

768
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
 And I don't have to wonder,

769
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,860
 and I don't have to walk in securely.

770
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,500
 And when shame and guilt come,

771
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,620
 I let that drive me back to the reason

772
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,820
 I trusted Jesus, because I am a sinner.

773
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,100
 And walking my faith involves trusting

774
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,060
 in who God says that you are.

775
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,960
 And let me finish here, a third idea.

776
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,760
 Which comes from Genesis chapter 21,

777
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,720
 and then really 22.

778
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,500
 Verse five of chapter 21.

779
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,920
 Abraham was 100 years old

780
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,520
 when his son Isaac was born to him.

781
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,600
 Sometime later, verse one of chapter 22.

782
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,240
 So Abraham's 100 years old.

783
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,080
 They waited 100 years.

784
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,800
 His wife was 90.

785
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,760
 Imagine that day.

786
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,960
 God finally fulfills his promise.

787
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,660
 As a 90-year-old woman, let alone how astounding

788
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,940
 that must have been.

789
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,540
 You know any 90-year-old women?

790
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,360
 And they have this baby.

791
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,220
 They've been waiting years and decades and decades.

792
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,760
 I mean, how many family get-togethers

793
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,240
 had they got together?

794
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,800
 She's 90.

795
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 And you know how many kids have sat on her lap

796
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,620
 that were her own?

797
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,460
 None.

798
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,440
 Every single time they get together,

799
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
 and there's another baby, another people in the family,

800
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,360
 and they sit there, and they're always holding other kids

801
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
 or other people's kids, thinking,

802
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,000
 "Man, I would love to have one of these."

803
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,860
 And then God promises, and for 25 years,

804
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,920
 all they hold is other people's kids,

805
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,080
 holding on, and then God promised this would happen.

806
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,160
 And then it happens.

807
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,640
 And then in verse one of chapter 22,

808
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,280
 after Isaac's had a little bit of time

809
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,640
 where he's grown up, Isaac is the name of the son,

810
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,480
 it says this.

811
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,780
 Sometime later, God tested Abraham.

812
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,160
 And he said to him, "Abraham,"

813
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,660
 and Abraham said, "Here I am."

814
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,360
 And then God said, "I want you to take your son,

815
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,000
 "your only son, whom you love, Isaac.

816
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,180
 "Take your one and only son,

817
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,560
 "and I want you to go to the region of Moriah,"

818
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,880
 which is an area today right outside of Jerusalem,

819
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,160
 "sacrifice him there.

820
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,160
 "As a burnt offering, on a mountain that I will show you."

821
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,220
 Early the next morning,

822
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,080
 Abraham got up and he loaded his donkey.

823
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,720
 I've gotta be thinking, he's going,

824
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,520
 "Where are you going with this, God?

825
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,080
 "You promised that Isaac would be the one

826
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,880
 "that you would continue the bloodline through.

827
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,960
 "You would continue your promise,

828
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,040
 "you would keep your covenant with him.

829
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,320
 "You promised not just any son,

830
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,880
 "but you promised through Isaac.

831
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 "In chapter 17, you want me to kill him?"

832
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,160
 What I think had happened is over his time,

833
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,660
 Abraham had gone from the guy that was afraid for his life,

834
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,280
 so he basically sold out his wife

835
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,400
 and told her to be his sister,

836
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,240
 to then he sees at 90 years old,

837
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,600
 his wife give birth to a baby,

838
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,840
 and that's gotta strengthen his faith.

839
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,280
 And he sees God come again and again through,

840
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,120
 and it strengthens his faith.

841
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,520
 And so I don't know what emotions were going through,

842
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,480
 I'm sure as a father,

843
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,520
 and he's going, "What are you asking me?"

844
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,520
 But God, I'm learning and I've learned to trust you.

845
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,600
 And so I'm not sure what you're doing, but we'll go.

846
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,720
 If you're asking me to sacrifice my son,

847
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,360
 I'm not sure where this is going, but I'll trust you.

848
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,460
 And he took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac.

849
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,760
 When he'd cut the wood for the burnt offering,

850
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,200
 he set out for the place that God had told him about.

851
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,280
 On the third day, Abraham looked up

852
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,720
 and he saw the place in the distance.

853
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,420
 So God said, "Hey, I'm gonna tell you exactly where to go."

854
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,720
 And it ends up being a place

855
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,580
 right outside of modern day Jerusalem today, Moriah.

856
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,400
 And he gets there, took three days with his boy,

857
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,960
 two servants, and he says this.

858
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,560
 He said to the servants, "Stay here with the donkey

859
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,640
 "while I and the boy go over there.

860
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,760
 "We will worship and then we will come back to you."

861
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,860
 Wait, he said, "What?"

862
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,520
 "Stay here, servants.

863
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,660
 "I'm gonna go over there with the boy

864
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,100
 "and we will worship God.

865
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,920
 "And then we will come back over here."

866
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,880
 Abraham, God told you to sacrifice your son.

867
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
 What are you saying?

868
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,560
 We will come back over here.

869
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,200
 God knew, or sorry, Abraham knew

870
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,480
 that even in the midst of God asking him to sacrifice,

871
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,940
 we're told in the book of Hebrews,

872
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,960
 that he believed that even if God was asking him,

873
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,000
 that he knew God could even raise him from the dead.

874
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so he knew, I don't know what this is gonna look like,

875
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,800
 but I know that even if it requires him dying

876
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,740
 and being brought back to life, God can do it.

877
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,680
 Abraham took with him the wood for the burnt offering

878
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,580
 and he placed it on his son Isaac.

879
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,920
 And as Isaac carried the wood

880
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,800
 that he would be sacrificed on up the mountain.

881
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,480
 And he himself carried the fire and a knife.

882
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,100
 And as the two of them went on together,

883
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,720
 Isaac spoke up and he said to his father,

884
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,880
 Abraham, "Father."

885
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,280
 And he said, "Yes, my son.

886
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,740
 "The wood and the fire are here,

887
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,520
 "but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?"

888
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,360
 And Abraham answered,

889
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,380
 "God himself will provide the lamb

890
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,020
 "for the burnt offering, my son."

891
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,840
 And the two of them went on together.

892
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,520
 When they reached the place that God had told him about,

893
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,760
 Abraham built an altar there, he arranged the wood,

894
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,720
 he bound his son Isaac,

895
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,760
 and he laid him on the altar on top of that wood.

896
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,800
 Then he reached out his hand

897
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,520
 and he took the knife to slay his son.

898
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,240
 But the angel of the Lord called from heaven,

899
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,140
 "Abraham, Abraham, here I am," Abraham replied.

900
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,760
 "Do not lay a hand on the boy.

901
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,080
 "Do not do anything to him.

902
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,000
 "For I know that you fear God

903
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,280
 "because you've not withheld from me your son,

904
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,560
 "your only son."

905
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,300
 And Abraham looked up and there in the thicket,

906
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,420
 as he raises his eyes, he sees a lamb,

907
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,340
 I'm sorry, a ram caught by its horns.

908
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,500
 And he went over and he took the ram

909
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,100
 and he sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.

910
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,180
 So Abraham called that day, "The Lord will provide."

911
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,020
 And this day it is said,

912
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,700
 "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided."

913
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,420
 So Abraham gets ready, he's about to kill his son,

914
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,500
 and he's called from heaven, and God says, "Don't do it."

915
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,700
 And God provided, miraculously, a ram

916
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,100
 in the midst of the thicket.

917
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,340
 And he goes over and he sacrifices,

918
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,260
 and Abraham renames the mountain, "The Lord will provide."

919
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,100
 I'm gonna come back to that here in a second.

920
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,820
 But the third quality that we see

921
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,240
 from the story of Abraham is that true faith

922
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,160
 involves surrendering to God, even what we value most.

923
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,980
 Like for Abraham, I don't know that there was a thing

924
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,580
 in his life that he valued more than his son.

925
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,300
 I mean, I've talked about it before, like as a dad,

926
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,540
 it is hard for me to communicate how much I love my son.

927
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,140
 Like I'll wake up in the middle of the night,

928
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,240
 sad about ever not being around,

929
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,760
 or being apart from my child.

930
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,380
 And as a dad, he's waited 100 years,

931
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,020
 and now God is saying, "Hey, I want you to

932
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,560
 "sacrifice him to me.

933
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,280
 "I want you to trust me.

934
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,340
 "Do you trust me?"

935
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,940
 And at some point, as the journey of faith happens,

936
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,180
 for all of us, it involves us, begged the question,

937
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,300
 "Do we trust you with what we value most in life?"

938
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,860
 I don't know what you value most in life.

939
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,540
 For many of us, or for all of us, it's probably different,

940
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,000
 but it's probably some that run through the room.

941
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,460
 But think about that.

942
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,260
 Like is it marriage?

943
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,620
 Like you may not say like, "Yeah, of course,

944
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,900
 "at the end of the day, the thing that I value most

945
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,740
 "is marriage."

946
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,980
 But it would be at least in the category of like,

947
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,720
 "Man, that's a really big deal to you."

948
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,560
 If it came down to never getting married,

949
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,300
 because of following God's way,

950
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,420
 or you can do whatever the world says and get married,

951
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,300
 if you were like, "Yeah, I'll probably just go

952
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,380
 "with what the world says and get married,

953
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,500
 "I mean, there's forgiveness, right?"

954
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,620
 You would know that that is something

955
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,120
 you value tremendously.

956
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,400
 Whatever that line that you'd come up to and be like,

957
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,260
 "If God asked me to get rid of this or to not do this,

958
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,460
 "I'm not doing that,"

959
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,480
 reflects something that you're like,

960
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,760
 "Man, I value that so tremendously."

961
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,900
 And as Abraham journeyed along that,

962
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,600
 he was forced to reckon with, "Man, do I trust God,

963
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,060
 "not just with my eternity, with my sin,

964
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,900
 "with kind of everything, but with this,

965
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,500
 "with everything in my life?"

966
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,540
 Maybe for you, it's like job.

967
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,900
 Maybe for you, it's health.

968
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,820
 Maybe it's just your plans,

969
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,240
 what you hope to happen.

970
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,080
 And if God ever began to mess with those and say like,

971
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,980
 "You know what, I don't want you to make a million by 35.

972
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,960
 "I want you to work a job, you're gonna make 40 grand

973
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,800
 "for the rest of your life,

974
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,120
 "and I want you to be faithful right there."

975
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,340
 And you're like, "Nope, not doing that."

976
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,480
 You would be exposed to the fact that, man,

977
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,460
 he would be asking you to trust him with something

978
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,200
 that is of incredible value to you.

979
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,940
 And he's saying, "You can trust me.

980
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,560
 "It will always work in your favor.

981
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,160
 "And if you don't, you will forfeit the ability

982
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,420
 "to see God work."

983
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,840
 I don't know what that is,

984
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,400
 but a question you should leave here asking is like,

985
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,280
 man, what is the thing,

986
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,200
 what are the things that I value most?

987
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,920
 What are the things that maybe you woke up this morning

988
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,080
 thinking about, you're gonna go to bed thinking about?

989
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,360
 Where I would be tempted to go,

990
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,060
 "I don't know that it's worth it."

991
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,600
 And Abraham saw God show up.

992
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
 And here's what I think is amazing.

993
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
 Like I said earlier, his faith grew, he got stronger.

994
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,440
 It's like, as he journeyed through life,

995
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,340
 like he clearly got stronger and stronger,

996
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,360
 because here's what faith is.

997
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
 Faith is a muscle.

998
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
 This is huge.

999
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
 This is why some of you don't have faith,

1000
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
 and it's really hard for you to get back in it,

1001
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,120
 and you had it like in youth group in high school,

1002
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,320
 but you're like, "Dude, I haven't picked this thing up

1003
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,160
 "since high school."

1004
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,640
 And it might as well be like a letter jacket

1005
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,460
 you haven't picked up.

1006
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,300
 It doesn't fit right anymore.

1007
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,960
 And you're like, "I'm trying to get back into faith."

1008
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,880
 Faith is like a muscle.

1009
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,560
 If you don't use it, you will lose it.

1010
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,800
 And I don't mean eternal security,

1011
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,500
 because once you are sealed, you're eternally secure.

1012
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,920
 But your confidence, that like, "Man, I can follow God.

1013
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,880
 "He's gonna show up.

1014
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,000
 "He's gonna provide.

1015
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,920
 "I can trust him.

1016
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,320
 "His way's always best."

1017
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,240
 The reason that it's so hard for you,

1018
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,180
 as it relates to dating, as it relates to your job,

1019
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,820
 as it relates to money, is 'cause you have not flexed

1020
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,760
 that muscle in a long time.

1021
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,140
 It's like this.

1022
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,520
 Like, weights.

1023
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,600
 I don't wanna brag, but these are 15-pound weights,

1024
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,880
 and I can do curls with them, okay?

1025
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,680
 And so, thank you, gentlemen.

1026
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,080
 And that's because, you know,

1027
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,040
 I've done relatively enough weight

1028
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
 to be able to lift up what is not even the size

1029
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,080
 of a small child.

1030
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,840
 And these are 35-pound weights.

1031
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,200
 A little bit harder, but I can pull 'em a little bit.

1032
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,320
 Yeah, no big deal.

1033
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
 I'm gonna stop there.

1034
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,880
 (audience laughing)

1035
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,740
 These are 70-pound weights, and I can barely pick 'em up.

1036
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,580
 And I can't even come close.

1037
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,420
 Okay.

1038
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,180
 You know why?

1039
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,420
 Because I haven't flexed the bicep muscle enough,

1040
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,540
 and used it enough to strengthen me to be able to do that.

1041
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,340
 Like, there's a dude on our team, a guy on our tech team,

1042
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,920
 that did it backstage earlier,

1043
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,680
 which was very painful for my man card.

1044
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,140
 But it's because I haven't gone through the sequence

1045
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,020
 of like, man, I can do that.

1046
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,500
 Like, I could get there if, over time,

1047
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,820
 I flex that muscle, and flex that muscle,

1048
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,380
 and flex that muscle.

1049
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,980
 But because I haven't, there's no way I can lift that.

1050
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,220
 Abraham, over his life journey,

1051
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,020
 like, he began to trust God, and trust God, and trust God,

1052
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,460
 and his faith grew, and it grew stronger.

1053
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,720
 Romans chapter four tells us that his faith grew in God

1054
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,540
 as he journeyed through life.

1055
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,780
 Faith is like a muscle, and if you don't use it,

1056
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,340
 it's gonna atrophy, and it's gonna go away.

1057
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,500
 That's why some people, you look at them,

1058
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,820
 and you're like, dude, you got cancer?

1059
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,340
 You're dying of stage four cancer.

1060
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,320
 And you are like, God is good.

1061
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,580
 I can't wait to go home.

1062
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,460
 I want him more than anything else in this life.

1063
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,340
 He's all that I want.

1064
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,460
 And you're over there, and you're like so ticked

1065
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,780
 that you're not able to have the first floor apartment.

1066
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,740
 And you're like, where is God in the midst of all of this?

1067
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,920
 And then you see people who suffer incredibly hard things,

1068
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,300
 and they're able to walk through it.

1069
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,700
 Not 'cause they love hard, challenging things,

1070
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,020
 but because they trust God in the midst of this,

1071
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,300
 'cause they flex that muscle.

1072
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,340
 They flex that muscle.

1073
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,440
 They flex that muscle.

1074
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,140
 And some of you haven't flexed that muscle in years.

1075
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,740
 And the way that you begin to strengthen that again

1076
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,380
 is you take step by step today,

1077
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,340
 God, I'm gonna do what you say.

1078
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
 If your word calls me to it,

1079
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,260
 I'm just gonna take that step, even if I don't want to.

1080
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,660
 And you know what I'm gonna do when I don't want to?

1081
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,420
 I'm gonna say, God, I do not want to do this.

1082
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,940
 I do not wanna leave this relationship.

1083
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,980
 I don't wanna get in the community.

1084
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,900
 I don't wanna join church.

1085
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,780
 And I really don't wanna leave my job.

1086
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,740
 I have to look for something different

1087
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,460
 'cause they want me to work 100 hours a week

1088
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,540
 or 80 hours a week, which means I can't actually follow you.

1089
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,460
 And so you tell me I need to be in community

1090
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,060
 and small group and things like that.

1091
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,180
 So I'm at least gonna tell you I don't want to do that.

1092
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,380
 Will you help me to have trust in you to do that?

1093
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,380
 And you just flex that muscle and you take that step

1094
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,620
 and you see God come through.

1095
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,140
 And when you don't, you forfeit seeing God show up.

1096
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,900
 Abraham, had he not been willing to follow

1097
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,900
 and be obedient to God, you forfeit seeing God show up

1098
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,140
 and miraculously provided a ram for him.

1099
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,060
 But you forfeit, like some of you, it breaks my heart, man.

1100
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,740
 You're dating guys or you're dating girls

1101
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,940
 and you know that God has called you.

1102
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
 This is not for you.

1103
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,180
 This is not the type of relationship,

1104
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,060
 like there's dysfunction all over it.

1105
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,100
 The dude's not even following Jesus

1106
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,060
 or maybe she's not following Jesus

1107
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,980
 and you need to break up and get healthy.

1108
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,860
 And you're like, yeah, but I feel like I'm just too invested.

1109
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,740
 I mean, I don't wanna start,

1110
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,940
 oh, this may be the only shot I got.

1111
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,660
 Better to have one here than none.

1112
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,460
 And when you do that, you forfeit

1113
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,300
 who God could have brought along.

1114
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,620
 You forfeit seeing the plan and the story

1115
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,060
 he wanted to write or would have written.

1116
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,260
 And I'm not saying it always ends

1117
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,980
 like you at the altar guaranteed.

1118
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,660
 I'm saying you forfeit showing, seeing God show up

1119
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,700
 in a way that is better than you could have imagined.

1120
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,180
 Same thing at work.

1121
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,660
 When you're unwilling, when you see people

1122
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,980
 that you work with and they're crossing lines morally,

1123
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,180
 ethically, they're telling you, this is what you do.

1124
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,780
 You go to strip clubs.

1125
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,180
 And you're like, well, this is not what people

1126
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,060
 who follow Jesus do.

1127
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,380
 I don't go to strip clubs, so I'm not doing it.

1128
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,180
 And if it costs me my job, it costs me my job.

1129
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,020
 And when you basically go and do,

1130
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,220
 I'm just gonna go to a strip club, it's not that big deal.

1131
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,460
 You forfeit seeing.

1132
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,140
 When you do that versus standing up and saying,

1133
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,940
 I'm not gonna do that, you forfeit seeing

1134
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,340
 what God could have done in his provision

1135
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,300
 and him showing up.

1136
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,860
 Ultimately, the story, and I'm gonna land here,

1137
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,820
 is an incredible parallel to Jesus.

1138
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,220
 Like, I don't know if you saw it all throughout the pages

1139
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,620
 and all throughout the story.

1140
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:01,220
 It's like in every turn, it echoes

1141
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,220
 that this thing was pointing to something so much more

1142
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,460
 than Abraham, something so much more than Isaac.

1143
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,140
 And even the idea of like, he looked up

1144
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,980
 and what did he see?

1145
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,820
 He saw a ram.

1146
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,260
 There's also something else we're told that he saw.

1147
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,500
 Like, you know what I mean?

1148
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,820
 Like in Genesis chapter 22, it says,

1149
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:20,580
 Abraham looked up and he raised his eyes at the last minute

1150
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
 and there in the thicket, he saw a ram

1151
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,380
 caught by its horns in the thicket.

1152
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,780
 Jesus would say, 2,000 years later,

1153
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,740
 that is not the only thing that Abraham saw.

1154
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,420
 He says this in John chapter eight, verse 56.

1155
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,700
 He's talking to this crowd

1156
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,300
 who is like this bunch of Jewish leaders

1157
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,460
 and Jesus shows up and he's a total savage Jesus

1158
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,540
 and he's like, hey dude, you guys are not children

1159
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
 of Abraham, you're not actually descendants

1160
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,620
 by faith of him.

1161
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,180
 And they're like, yeah, we are, we love Jesus,

1162
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,780
 or we love God, yes we do, we love God, how about you?

1163
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,260
 And he's like, no, you're not.

1164
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,460
 Abraham looked to me, Jesus speaking.

1165
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,020
 He saw my day coming and he longed to see it.

1166
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,500
 This is what it says.

1167
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,740
 Your father, Abraham, rejoiced at the thought

1168
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,860
 of seeing my day.

1169
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,100
 Listen to the next few words.

1170
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,540
 And he saw it and was glad.

1171
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,660
 That's a funny thing to say.

1172
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,580
 Jesus, what are you saying?

1173
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,780
 Also, the Bible, there's times where Jesus would be like,

1174
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,460
 hey, those guys would have loved to seen me.

1175
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,060
 I'm Jesus, this is awesome.

1176
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,020
 And people in the past would have loved to seen me.

1177
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,860
 The Bible says, the past would have loved to seen it.

1178
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,740
 He says something really different here.

1179
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,420
 He says, Abraham would have loved to seen my day.

1180
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,540
 And he saw it.

1181
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,940
 And he was glad.

1182
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,700
 It's as though in the midst of looking up in that thicket

1183
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,820
 and he saw the ram that he saw much more than a ram,

1184
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,820
 but he would see in some way that God doesn't tell us.

1185
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,780
 God connected the dots.

1186
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,460
 Can you see it, Abraham?

1187
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,580
 It's not just a ram there.

1188
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,000
 In a way, he would have been seeing the lamb of God,

1189
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,700
 not caught in a thicket with his horns,

1190
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,060
 but caught there with a crown of thorns on his head,

1191
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,740
 that one day all of this was pointing to Jesus.

1192
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:06,680
 And on that mountain, in that moment, he says,

1193
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,420
 don't kill your son 'cause one day I'm gonna kill mine.

1194
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,840
 Isaac carried the wood up the mountain for his sacrifice.

1195
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,880
 Jesus, we're told, carried the wooden cross up his mountain

1196
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,180
 to be sacrificed for you and for me.

1197
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,460
 Every turn showcases this was so much bigger than Isaac

1198
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,500
 in that moment of faith.

1199
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,860
 It was about you, it was about me, it was about Jesus.

1200
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,040
 (congregation laughing)

1201
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,740
 We're told that Jesus was sacrificed

1202
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,960
 on a mountain named Calvary.

1203
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,820
 Do you know what that mountain also is called?

1204
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,180
 Mount Moriah.

1205
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,380
 The same mountain Jesus died,

1206
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,380
 like that's where they're standing.

1207
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,440
 And I don't mean like metaphorically,

1208
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,540
 like it was a mountain and you're like,

1209
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,460
 well, he raised a mountain.

1210
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,360
 I mean the same dirt.

1211
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,220
 They're standing in the very same place

1212
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,020
 where 2,000 years later, God would send his son

1213
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:54,400
 to die on that cross to provide the sacrifice,

1214
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,620
 not just for Abraham and his bloodline,

1215
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,220
 but for you and for me, for every person.

1216
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,540
 It was all pointing to Jesus.

1217
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,000
 The whole storyline points to Jesus

1218
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,520
 because there was a sickness in the bloodline

1219
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,580
 and he entered into human form in order for you and me

1220
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,340
 to have access to God, not through being a good person.

1221
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,260
 And Abraham, he looked up and he's there with his son

1222
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,760
 and we're told by Jesus and he saw it.

1223
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,900
 He saw everything was about Jesus.

1224
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,460
 He saw the coming Messiah was coming.

1225
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,880
 He saw the plan of God in a way that we're not told

1226
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,180
 all the details and ins and outs,

1227
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,380
 but we're told that he saw Jesus coming and he was glad.

1228
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,240
 I don't know what you're walking through tonight,

1229
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,700
 but I know this with all of my heart.

1230
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,140
 Everything that you've experienced today, this week,

1231
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,980
 in your life has been an attempt from the God

1232
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,900
 of the universe to get you to see Jesus.

1233
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,960
 And the same way that in that moment,

1234
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,020
 he looked up and he saw his day coming

1235
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,860
 and he was glad.

1236
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,940
 Everything you've experienced,

1237
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,860
 and listen to me very closely,

1238
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,700
 every heartbreak, every challenge,

1239
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,940
 every sickness in your family,

1240
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:59,140
 every struggle at work, everything broken about our world

1241
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:04,500
 is a chance where God is trying to get you to look,

1242
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,420
 to see the Savior, for you to see what Abraham saw.

1243
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,820
 The lamb who would come, who would give his life,

1244
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,220
 who all darkness bows to, who defeated death that day.

1245
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,600
 And when he rose, here's what you gotta know.

1246
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,700
 He put sin on an expiration date

1247
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,000
 and it has no power, it has no hold.

1248
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,720
 And if you are in Christ, you are righteous.

1249
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,040
 You are part of that covenant.

1250
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,080
 There is nothing that can separate you from the bloodline

1251
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,320
 because of the one who gave his blood.

1252
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,280
 And some of you, you're still trusting not in Jesus

1253
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,800
 and faith in him, but in what you do.

1254
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,400
 And tonight is your night where God is saying,

1255
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,480
 it will never work.

1256
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,120
 And all of your life, I'm trying to get you to see Jesus

1257
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,960
 and see him in the midst of even the brokenness

1258
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,720
 would point you to the need for a Savior and a solution

1259
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,920
 that God sent his son.

1260
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,400
 Let me pray.

1261
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,660
 Father, I pray for anyone in this room right now,

1262
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,600
 and there are many who've never trusted in Jesus.

1263
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,240
 I pray for the men and women

1264
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,180
 at the 17 other PortsLive locations

1265
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,160
 that are hearing my voice,

1266
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,440
 that right now are bowing their head

1267
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,520
 and they know that they are far from you.

1268
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,160
 They know that they have not lived in line with you.

1269
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,280
 They know that they are not deserving

1270
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,320
 of a relationship with you,

1271
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,400
 that you would protect them from buying the enemy's lie,

1272
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,520
 that good things and good works and good deeds

1273
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
 could possibly earn them the right.

1274
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,680
 Father, thank you for just the incredible truth

1275
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,920
 that you loved us so much, that you gave your life for us.

1276
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,040
 You're still at work.

1277
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,720
 Darkness is bowing to you and it will bow to you

1278
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,560
 in every addiction, every sickness,

1279
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,880
 everything that sin brought into this world is breaking away

1280
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,080
 and you're reversing the curse,

1281
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,520
 but I pray, God, that you would right now

1282
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,480
 stretch your hand out and open eyes

1283
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,080
 for people to trust in you who've never done that.

1284
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,880
 We love you, amen.

1285
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:11,880
