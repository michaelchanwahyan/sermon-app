[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)

[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.180]   - Love it.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.300]   I'm gonna continue reading through 1 Peter,
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.540]   and then I'll pray, and then we'll dive in.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.140]   Picking it up in chapter two, verse one.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.060]   Peter says this.
[00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.340]   Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.460]   and of all deceit, hypocrisy, envy,
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.740]   and slander of every kind.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.500]   Like newborn babies, crave the pure spiritual milk
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.780]   so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
[00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.260]   now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.860]   As you come to him, the living stone, that's Christ,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.060]   rejected by humans but chosen by God and precious to him,
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.600]   you also, like living stones,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900]   are being built into a spiritual house
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.000]   to be a royal or holy priesthood,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.700]   offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.240]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.980]   For in scripture it says,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.820]   see, I lay in a stone in Zion,
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.060]   a chosen and precious cornerstone,
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.220]   and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.920]   Now to you who believe this stone, Jesus, is precious,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.220]   but to those who do not believe,
[00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.620]   the stone the builders rejected
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.060]   has become the cornerstone,
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.160]   a stone that causes people to stumble
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.320]   and a rock that makes them fall.
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.560]   They stumble because they disobey the message,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.480]   which is also what they were destined for.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.920]   But you are a chosen people,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920]   a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.720]   God's special possession,
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.600]   that you may proclaim or declare the praises of him
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.880]   who called you out of darkness
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.040]   and into his marvelous light.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.080]   Once you were not a people,
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.880]   but now you have become the people of God.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.740]   Once you had not received mercy,
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.180]   but now you have received mercy.
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.020]   Let me pray.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.780]   Father, we thank you just for the words of Peter.
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.700]   Would you use them tonight to strengthen our hearts,
[00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500]   to make us fall more in love with the cornerstone,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.740]   with our savior, with Jesus,
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.200]   to make us look more like Jesus,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.040]   to make us see more of Jesus.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.860]   Pray for anyone in this room
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.660]   who doesn't have a relationship with you, Lord,
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.260]   or that maybe just feels overwhelmed
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.460]   by the circumstances in their life,
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.580]   would you win tonight?
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.400]   Would you win?
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240]   Amen.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.920]   Well, hello, friends in the room
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.880]   and friends in Fort Worth and Houston
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.120]   and Spring and the Woodlands and El Paso and everywhere.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.040]   Tune around, Tulsa joining us tonight.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.480]   I'm gonna start, continue the series
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.380]   with a little bit of a story.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.360]   When I was, about eight years ago,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.680]   I got a phone call from Watermark that said,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.400]   "Hey, if you come up here and jump on our staff part-time,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.460]   "we will pay you something very small
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.760]   "and we will provide housing for you."
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.440]   So it'll like enrich.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.620]   Though we can't pay you a ton,
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.300]   we'll provide free housing for you.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.420]   And so they said it would be in the back house
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.740]   of this family.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.020]   So I, through long series, ended up being like,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.340]   "Yeah, I'm gonna come and I'm gonna do it."
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.720]   And came on staff here and didn't know the house
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.780]   that I was gonna be set up in.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.020]   I was gonna live in this back house
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.700]   and they gave me the address and I went to it
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.160]   and had no idea what to expect.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.060]   I packed up my stuff in College Station, Texas,
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.700]   headed up from, yeah, thank you, there we go.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.980]   Headed up from Texas A&M, the greatest university on earth,
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.980]   and went to, (laughs)
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.200]   man, I does it every time.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.680]   And I went and I headed towards this house.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.720]   So I'm going, not sure what to expect.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.680]   I finally, I pull up to this house
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.280]   and little did I know that the street
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.400]   that I was pulling up to this house was on,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.760]   I would find out, was a street that's known in Dallas
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.120]   called Billionaire's Row.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.320]   And so it was like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Unleashed.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.080]   It was like, man, I pulled up to the house,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.400]   seven or eight, man, there's Uncle Phil, Carlton's here.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.200]   This is unbelievable.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.260]   I'm like, I cannot believe this is where I'm about to live
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.100]   for the next year.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.600]   This is the nicest living I will ever have
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.120]   for the rest of my life.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.120]   Can you guys adopt me?
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.280]   Will you be my dad?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.800]   And it was like unreal, this house.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.560]   And so literally, if I was to go through
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.920]   some of the billionaires or just the people that lived,
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.680]   the neighbors, the politicians, the sports stars,
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.560]   they were names recognized that were just kind of
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.000]   the neighbors that lived on this street next to us.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.560]   And I say that 'cause I got to know the family
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.960]   and spend time with them and it was just
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.680]   this amazing experience for a year.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.840]   And at some point, I began to be friends
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.080]   with one of the sons or the son in this family
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.040]   and we were talking about the homes that were around
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.440]   and talking about the neighbors that were there
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.020]   and he goes, dude, that's nothing.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.200]   There's a house two doors down.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.640]   It makes the rest of the houses around here
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.400]   look like little child's play,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.000]   little gingerbread houses or something.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.400]   I mean, this house, the average house around this street
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.120]   in this area is 10,000 square feet, which is big.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.740]   This house is 70,000 square feet.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.640]   And he's like, hey, I got to take you over
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.520]   so you can see kind of the plot of land
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.120]   'cause you could go behind the back
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.240]   and which will make sense why.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.120]   You could go behind the backyards, two houses down.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.040]   He's like, you got to come see it.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.860]   But here's what else.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.120]   So it was 70,000 square feet.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.440]   I mean, this house is like unreal.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.640]   This is on Cribs or something
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.240]   if they still have the Cribs show.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.040]   16 car garage with its own indoor car wash.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.480]   A 21 person movie theater.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.840]   The master suite, man, this is so crazy.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.280]   Master suite was 3,000 square feet.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.600]   That is twice as big as my house.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.160]   And that's just the bedroom that these people are living in.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.620]   They had a two-story suite and wing for the kids
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.240]   that had its own jacuzzis.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.860]   It had all this huge setup.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.600]   They had these inside of their bathrooms,
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.840]   two of these huge Carrara marble from Italy,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.940]   Verona flown in to be there.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.940]   The staircase, $300,000 for the stairs, people.
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.740]   (laughs)
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.720]   Man, that's crazy.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.320]   Anyways, so he's going through
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.160]   and he's telling me all about it.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.240]   And there was a wine room that had 20,000 bottles of wine
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.200]   that could fit inside of it.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.300]   There was a gift wrapping room.
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.600]   Who has a gift wrapping room?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.920]   I guess if you got a house that big.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.900]   It was the second biggest home in America.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.640]   There was another home on the property
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.760]   that's 10 acres, 2,600 square feet
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.520]   that the guards lived in.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.920]   Man, and they were living well inside of it.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.280]   It had its own full 6,000 square foot indoor pool
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.300]   and indoor volleyball pool for people to play volleyball
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.580]   inside of the pool and a huge lap pool in there.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.340]   Like it was just this crazy home.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.640]   And he's telling me all about everything
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.420]   that's a part of this home.
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.420]   And he takes me over there and I see the acreage
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.920]   and there's nothing.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.960]   Like it's like, it was a bunch of rubble.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.040]   And he explains three weeks before,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.240]   this house it took eight years to build.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.320]   Three weeks before they were supposed to move in there.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.360]   They were finishing touches.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.480]   They were staining the final parts of the floor.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.900]   And you can look it up.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.300]   Three weeks before the stain combusted
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.620]   and basically the windows acted like a magnifying glass
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.040]   and it all went up in flames.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.340]   All of it, $44 million worth of it.
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.580]   It was the single largest loss of a home in Dallas history.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.040]   It was at the time the most expensive home
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.960]   that Dallas has ever, that's ever been built.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.540]   And this home that was like incredible.
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.820]   I mean, all the different finishing touches by this family,
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.760]   they had put and here's how it's gonna be designed
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.900]   and everything so that we can live there.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.880]   This house would never fulfill its purpose.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.720]   What's its purpose?
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.040]   For people to live in it.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.060]   Not just have it be talked about and have it be worked on,
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.780]   but people to live in it.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.260]   That's the purpose of a home.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.260]   And three weeks right before everything would be,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.540]   or everyone would be moved in there,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.940]   it all went up in flames.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.980]   It never fulfilled its purpose.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.840]   And I start there because tonight as we explore first Peter,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.980]   what Peter's gonna tell us is that there is a purpose
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.260]   that now that we have become Christians,
[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.020]   or if you become a Christ follower,
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.100]   there is certain and specific purposes
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.340]   that God has given his church or the body of Christ
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.740]   to experience to fulfill,
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.460]   that there's a purpose and design for you and I's life.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.380]   And as young adults, there are thousands
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.820]   that are gathered here and all over the state of Texas
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.860]   and even scattered throughout
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.180]   that are listening with us tonight.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.820]   We're in this stage of life where many of us,
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.060]   just like that home was on the verge
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.320]   of fulfilling its purpose.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.120]   It was on the verge of like people being in there
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.640]   and people living there and it never made it.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.960]   We are on the verge of this unique time in life
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   where you have more money, you have more access,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.120]   you have more free time than you're gonna have
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.920]   in later circumstances by money.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.360]   I just mean disposable income.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.880]   I don't get to spend money on just whatever.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.840]   I spend it on diapers.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   That's what I spend it on.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.240]   You have this like disposable income,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.160]   you have more disposable time.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.000]   You can choose what to do.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.560]   You have this freedom that is unique
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   to this season of life.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.080]   You're on the verge and in so many ways
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.440]   at the edge of experiencing your purpose,
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.740]   but yet so few young adults ever do.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.740]   And honestly, so few Christians,
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.820]   tragically, even more tragic than a $44 million home,
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.100]   never experiencing its purpose.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.320]   How much more tragic is it for a Christian
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.420]   to never step and cross over the boundary of its purpose,
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.900]   the purpose for which he or she was created?
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.720]   So tonight, Peter's gonna tell us
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.060]   what components of that are.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.860]   If you and I are ever gonna experience the purpose
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.660]   for which you as a Christ follower,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.460]   the salvation or the purpose for which you've been saved,
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.260]   he's gonna tell us what that looks like.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.100]   And really, even if you're not a Christ follower,
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:14.940]   you're new to this thing,
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.980]   it's really he's gonna give us the purpose for all of life,
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.420]   regardless of where you're at in this stage.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.300]   So we're gonna pick it up in verse one of chapter two
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.700]   as we continue this series.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.420]   Chapter one, if you missed it the last couple weeks,
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.260]   go check it out.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.080]   It's all in the app,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.300]   but we just explored the first couple weeks
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.780]   where Peter in chapter one hits on these themes
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.700]   of being born again.
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.020]   Like, hey, you've been born, you've been given this new life
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.620]   God has done something, he's changed you,
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.940]   now you're to walk by faith,
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.500]   even in the midst of trials, that God has done something.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.260]   And we stopped in verse 12,
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.220]   and really, Peter continues to talk about this new life,
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.500]   new birth that you've been given
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.740]   on the next few verses in chapter one.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.780]   And in chapter two, he transitions,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.580]   after talking about what you have in Christ,
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.460]   he begins to talk about what you do
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.120]   with what you have in Christ.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.780]   We'll read it again in verse one.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.340]   Here's what he says.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.340]   Therefore, in light of this new birth,
[00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.460]   in light of this new life that God has given you,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.160]   rid yourselves of all malice or like maliciousness,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.080]   don't behave towards people in an ill will,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.060]   like I hate this person, hatred could be interchanged there,
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.100]   of all deceit, don't deceive others,
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.220]   hypocrisy or being inauthentic or just faking it.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.460]   Rid yourself of envy, of slander,
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.820]   of talking bad about people,
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.780]   of slander of every kind, and here's what you do.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.660]   So you take that off, you put something on,
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.580]   like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk,
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.940]   so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.740]   now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.340]   Like Peter says, hey, if you want to begin
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.520]   to experience your purpose in the Christian life,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.480]   what do you do with what you have?
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.620]   You've got this new life, now that you have that new life,
[00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.740]   there's some certain things you're supposed
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.280]   to rid your life of, and now begin to consume yourself,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.620]   or things that you're beginning to put into your life.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.660]   You're to begin to consume the spiritual milk, he says,
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.380]   that just like milk makes a baby grow,
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.020]   you need to begin to consume the things
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.820]   that are gonna make your faith grow.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.560]   Consume the things like God's word, you need to grow up,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.500]   make the things that are gonna grow your faith
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.820]   and grow your relationship with Christ.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.740]   Consume the things, disregard the things
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.740]   that are gonna hurt your faith,
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.060]   consume the things and consume your life
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.540]   with the things that are gonna grow your faith.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.820]   Just like a child, this is how you grow up in maturity.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.140]   You begin to fill your mind with God's word,
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.380]   you begin to fill your time with God's people in your life.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.860]   He says, look, at the point you're at in life
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.500]   as newborn babes or as Christians,
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.580]   now that you have this new life,
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.380]   as he would say to all of us, you've got to grow up.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.060]   God's purpose for you is not just that you sit there
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.460]   and that you're done and that, oh,
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:41.540]   you go to heaven when you die,
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.580]   that you would begin to experience your purpose,
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.300]   which starts with growing up in Christ.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.660]   Our first idea from the text, Peter says right from it,
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.980]   is that you and I are to now grow up in Christ.
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.700]   How do we grow up in Christ, Peter?
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.540]   By, how do you grow, how does a child grow?
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.740]   They consume food, it all of a sudden builds them up.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.620]   Peter says in the same way, he uses the illustration,
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.780]   that you and I are to consume the things that grow our faith
[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.180]   and starve the things that hurt our faith,
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.180]   that we're to consume the things,
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.440]   specifically God's word around God's people.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.780]   And he even gives the reason why, he's like,
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.700]   look, you've tasted how good it is to know God,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.980]   how good it is to walk with God.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.120]   If you became a Christian, I mean,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.760]   you've tasted and experienced the goodness
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.100]   that comes from like freedom,
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.820]   or from freedom from sin and forgiveness,
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.940]   grace in your life, he's like,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.420]   you've tasted how good God is,
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.340]   and it's given you a superior satisfaction.
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.860]   Now, continue to consume the things
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.680]   that are gonna grow your faith.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.680]   Continue to study God's word, continue to grow up,
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.780]   he would say, to you and to me,
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.300]   and the key way that we do that,
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.380]   the key way that you grow as an individual
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.900]   is not by some self-help book,
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.700]   but by you studying God's word,
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.300]   living in community with God's people.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.520]   He says that you've found this superior taste,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.340]   and it has changed, or let it change
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.900]   the things in your past that don't taste as good anymore,
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.180]   because you tasted something better in Christ.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.860]   It's not dissimilar to, when I grew up,
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.380]   and I'm gonna get judged for this,
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.460]   but I'm okay, 'cause hopefully it will illustrate.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.080]   We ate from first grade in my house
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.760]   to fifth grade in my house, I had the same exact thing
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.960]   every single day for lunch, it was a one of two options,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.260]   bologna and cheese and mayonnaise sandwiches,
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.420]   or option number two,
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.380]   bologna and cheese and ketchup sandwiches.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.360]   That was the entire thing.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.300]   If you came over to my house, this was just normal.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.020]   I didn't realize this was weird,
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.780]   that bologna was not good for a long, long time.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.020]   You came over to my house, there was one option.
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.180]   We're not doing PB&J, you get bologna and cheese
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.780]   and ketchup, or do you want mayonnaise?
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.060]   This is what you gotta call, and we loved it.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.540]   I mean, every single day, we're taking
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.740]   the little red lining off the outside.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.160]   Mom goes out of town, it's like, dude,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.180]   we're gonna stack this thing
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.700]   with 12 pieces of bologna in here,
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.180]   this disgusting meat made of the ends of a cow
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.460]   they just throw in a blender,
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.600]   and we're like, this is incredible, it's delicious,
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.440]   this is great, love it.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.760]   And then something happened.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.660]   Like this thing that I loved and I consumed so much of,
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.120]   at some point, I was introduced to something called
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.760]   the other deli meats, or actual deli meats.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.160]   And things like turkey, and at some point,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.040]   like in middle school, roast beef and chicken,
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.600]   this is crazy, what have I been eating in bologna
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.980]   all of these years, and this superior taste
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.040]   made it so easy to disregard it,
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.680]   made, I found something better inside of that.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.000]   And Peter begins to say that, look,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.740]   this is the Christian life, that you and I begin to,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.920]   I mean, to this day, like it literally changed.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.240]   When I smell bologna, the thing that I consume so much of,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.660]   I like can smell it right now,
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.520]   and it like makes me wanna throw up a little bit.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.000]   That's how like, oh my gosh, I cannot believe
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.400]   that it was normal to me.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.960]   And he says, this is what happens with the Christian life.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.880]   You find this superior taste,
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.920]   which comes from walking in deep relationship with God,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.700]   and things begin to change.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.040]   It may not happen overnight in an instant taste,
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.160]   but it begins to change, and the more you consume,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.640]   the more you want of Christ.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   I mean, I've seen it so many times.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.400]   I have a friend, one of my favorite volunteers
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.240]   that we've ever had here.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.600]   I remember when he came to Christ a few years ago,
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.560]   and he was in this discipleship group that I was leading.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.880]   We were talking about following Jesus
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.800]   and what that looked like, and he wanted to do it,
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.320]   and he said, look, dude, I'm all in,
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.320]   except for two things, weed and sex with my girlfriend.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.320]   And I was like, okay, got it, you're all in,
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.720]   except for weed and women, so you're not all in, okay?
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.240]   And he said, yeah, look, I'm all in,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.700]   except for these two things.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.000]   And he kept filling his life with God's word,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.760]   and he kept coming and kept getting disciple.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.380]   And the thing that, you know what I didn't say to him
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.220]   in that moment?
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.360]   I wasn't like, dude, hey, if you're gonna,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.820]   before you begin to follow Jesus,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.400]   you need to stop doing those things.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.560]   I said, you need to begin to follow Jesus.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.320]   And he kept coming, and he kept studying God's word,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.380]   and he kept surrounding himself by community,
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.660]   and honestly, when you're around him today,
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   like, it would be hard for you to imagine him
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.420]   like not being like a seminary professor or something.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.580]   He's a guy whose Bible's all marked up,
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.380]   he knows where the scripture passage is all,
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.780]   he's discipling people, he's now married,
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.680]   he's not smoking weed, like, everything has changed
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.640]   in his life.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.100]   And the guy was like, man, I just can't,
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.020]   I'm not, I'll probably never, ever give up weed and women.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.140]   Like, it's not even, not even something
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.780]   he's considering anymore.
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.540]   Not that there's not temptation to lust
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.420]   and things like that, it's just like this whole new person.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.740]   How did it change?
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.140]   He began to consume and fill his mind
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.500]   and fill his life with the things of God,
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.540]   things that grew him in his faith,
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.980]   and all of a sudden, these things just fell off.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.560]   This is the Christian life.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.300]   Some of you inside of the room, if you're not growing,
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.660]   Paul and Peter would say, hey, every Christian,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.760]   if you wanna experience your purpose,
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.640]   you should be growing.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.340]   And if you are not growing up, if your relationship
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.540]   or your faith is not growing, you are not experiencing
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.220]   this part of your purpose.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.300]   God doesn't have you just sit there statically.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.140]   He wants you to continue to grow,
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.020]   to be more like Christ in a year from now
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.200]   than you are now.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.140]   For me to be more like Christ tomorrow than I was today,
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.460]   that he wants all of us to begin to grow.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.900]   And I think a lot of you, the reason why people will come
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.340]   and they'll gather, maybe they go to church,
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.680]   and they're like, man, but I just am not growing.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.620]   You're not feeding yourself the things
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:14.420]   that Peter would say will lead to your growth.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.600]   You can hear a sermon all day, but at some point,
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.160]   you gotta feed yourself.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.780]   You gotta study God's word yourself.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.100]   You gotta walk in community with other believers yourself.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.000]   And if you don't, you will never grow.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.680]   And you're gonna finish 2017 and be probably
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.860]   just about the same, maybe even worse than it started.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.580]   And Peter says, look, you're gonna miss out on your purpose.
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.580]   Don't waste another day, don't waste another year.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.060]   How are you doing personally?
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.140]   By filling yourself, consuming things
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.700]   that are gonna grow your faith.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.780]   He says, if you do so, you will experience your purpose.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.340]   And then he goes into our second idea
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.820]   about one of the aspects of how we experience
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.660]   that personal growth.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.260]   Here's what he says, starting in verse four.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.660]   As you come to him, Jesus, the living stone,
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:05.100]   rejected by humans, but chosen by God and precious to him,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.540]   you also, like living stones, are being built
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.780]   into this spiritual house to be a holy priesthood,
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.420]   offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.540]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.180]   For as it says in scripture, see, I lay a stone in Zion,
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.620]   a chosen and precious cornerstone, that's Christ.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.780]   And anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.500]   Now, to you who believe, the stone is precious.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.100]   But to those who do not believe, the stone
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.380]   that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.860]   and a stone that causes people to stumble
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.080]   and a rock that makes them fall.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.820]   They stumble because they disobey the message,
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.160]   which they were also destined for, so much that he says,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.580]   but here's one of the key things that he says,
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.640]   is that God is like building something.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.420]   When you become a Christian, you are,
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.100]   he uses the word analogy, you're like this living stone.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.620]   It's like God takes Jesus, he's this cornerstone,
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.540]   and everything else is built around it.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.500]   He begins to place, if you became a Christian,
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.280]   you're all of a sudden entered into this big spiritual house
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.100]   that God is building, where you're connected
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.180]   to other stones, other living stones like you,
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.600]   and you're ultimately all connected to Christ.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.260]   That you and I are connected to one another,
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.500]   and all of us connected to one another
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.180]   through Christ, ultimately.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.480]   What Peter points out is what the Bible teaches
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.500]   over and over again, is that there is no,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.500]   hey, I'm just a solo living stone,
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.040]   I can do this thing all by myself.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.020]   I can live the Christian life all by myself.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.600]   I don't really need to be connected to other people.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.020]   We would go, look, intrinsic.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.540]   It's at the heart of Christianity
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.540]   that you would be connected to other people.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.140]   In other words, just like in that scenario,
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.020]   he says, you're a living stone,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.500]   you're supposed to be a part of this house,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.460]   you're not to be some stone that's over there,
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.020]   rogue, all by yourself.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.200]   The Christian faith is meant to be lived
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.480]   in community, in connection with one another.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.820]   The second idea from this text
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.220]   is that we're built up together on Christ.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.420]   If you wanna experience your purpose in life,
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.820]   you will not experience it if you are not connected deeply
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.980]   to other believers.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.360]   Like, if you're not a part of a church,
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.440]   you're not a community group,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.980]   you are not gonna experience your purpose in life,
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.340]   and neither will I.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.660]   God designed the church to work that way.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.100]   He really designed humanity to work that way.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.580]   But even more so for the church,
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.300]   he says, look, a part of this deal
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.740]   is that you would be connected to other believers.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.640]   God is building this spiritual house together.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.620]   This is why the idea that,
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.780]   man, you hear this all the time, too.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.300]   Hey, look, dude, I love Jesus, I'm just not big on church.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.580]   Like, I love God, and I'm for that, and I love Jesus,
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.940]   but I'm just not big on church.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.660]   Church is kinda boring, I don't really like it,
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.380]   but I'm cool with Jesus, he's my homeboy, I love Jesus.
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.540]   Here's why that's a bad idea.
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.920]   First off, the Bible calls the church
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.100]   the bride or the fiance of Christ.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.260]   Like, think about that.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.740]   Essentially what you're saying is like,
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.060]   dude, hey, Jesus, I'm cool with you,
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.340]   I'm just not cool with your fiance.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.740]   What guy in the world is ever gonna be cool
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.700]   with his buddies being like,
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.900]   dude, man, you my boy, man, but your girl,
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.860]   man, she is something else, a little lame.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.660]   And what guy's gonna be like,
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.920]   yeah, man, yeah, she is lame, come on.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.640]   Think about that, that's essentially what you say
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.120]   when you say to Jesus, look, I'm cool with you,
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.360]   I'm just not cool with your fiance, your bride, the church.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.000]   The Christian life has always been meant
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.760]   for you to be connected, to be a part of it,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.040]   and Christ said, look, I love my church, I love my bride.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.620]   You don't like it because there's broken sinners in there?
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.380]   Man, come join the crowd just like you.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.920]   But I love my bride.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.480]   The Christian life has always been meant
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.520]   for you to be connected to the body of Christ.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.960]   And if you're not connected because you don't like
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.120]   the church, you are not connected because you say to Jesus,
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.280]   I just don't like your fiance, I'm fine with you.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.520]   And you insult God's way to live.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.880]   And my guess is you insult your Savior,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.020]   who says, I love my bride, I'll die for my bride.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.000]   At the heart of Christianity is really this idea
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.280]   that you and I are to be connected like living stones,
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.640]   resting on top of one another on the cornerstone.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.240]   We're gonna talk about the cornerstone in a second.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.760]   But this idea of connected to one another,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.880]   I mean, it's so over and over and over again
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.480]   that you read Hebrews 10, 24, Hebrews 3, 13,
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.800]   all throughout the Psalms where it talks about
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.240]   how blessed it is that when brothers dwell in you,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.200]   that we're meant to live this life
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.320]   connected to one another.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.880]   Christianity, as we've said before, is a team sport.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.740]   You cannot play by yourself.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.120]   Like, it's like any team sport.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.960]   I mean, think about it.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.400]   I don't know if anybody would play basketball in here,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.680]   baseball, we'll just go with basketball.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.880]   Like, you cannot play basketball with a single person.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.700]   You think about that?
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.360]   Because basketball is a team sport.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.360]   Like, no, man, I could shoot free throws all day long.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.640]   That's not called playing basketball.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.960]   That's called practice.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   You cannot play the sport of basketball without teammates.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.880]   It was designed as a team sport.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   Christianity is the same way.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.800]   And you cannot participate, you cannot play the game
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.840]   without being deeply connected to one another.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.720]   What am I saying?
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.640]   If you are not a member of a church,
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.680]   you will not experience your purpose this year.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.640]   You're not experiencing your purpose right now.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.800]   And I'm not talking to the guy who's like,
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.400]   look, I have been praying and fasting for the last week,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.800]   and I'm trying to find which church,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.880]   God, local church he wants me to be a part of.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.320]   That person, man, God bless you,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.800]   keep going if we can answer questions.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.900]   I'm talking to the person who's like,
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.760]   yeah, I moved to Dallas a little bit ago,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.640]   and I'm trying to figure it out,
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.460]   been going around, checking a few places out.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.080]   Like this place on Tuesday, like this place on Sunday.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.800]   This is my every other Sunday place.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.980]   That's the person.
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.300]   But God says, man, go all in, connect.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.940]   There is no perfect church.
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.840]   There's just imperfect people devoted to a perfect Savior.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.560]   Join the crowd, use yourself and your gifts
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   and who's God made you to make his church even stronger.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.840]   Christianity is a team sport.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.200]   If you're not connected, you're not playing it.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:50.240]   He uses the idea of the foundation, a cornerstone.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.580]   So in the ancient world, they wouldn't build the foundation
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.120]   or they wouldn't build them the same way we do today.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.300]   A cornerstone essentially was like,
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.160]   it was the rock, the most important rock
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.000]   that everything else was built on top of.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.960]   It was the most valuable, they would take the most time
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.680]   selecting and choosing which stone
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.800]   that everything would be built on,
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.540]   and the cornerstone, because every other stone
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.800]   rested indirectly on the cornerstone.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.400]   You take the cornerstone out, everything will crumble.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:19.700]   And Peter says, this is how the church of Christ is.
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.500]   This is how Christianity is to be lived.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.260]   It's like Christ is the center.
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.020]   He's the thing that all of life is to be built around,
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.860]   and all of us, and we're connected to other people
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.520]   who build their life around him.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.660]   A cornerstone is the thing that everything's built around.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.500]   In the same way, he says,
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.460]   Jesus is the cornerstone of your life,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.880]   and he's to be the cornerstone of the church.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.360]   You and I are to build our life around him.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.480]   You got relationships, I got relationships,
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.640]   where we have friends, there's groups of people,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.600]   they build their lives around lots of things.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.580]   People build their lives around,
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.240]   hey, where's the next party at?
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.760]   People build their lives around the weekend,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.500]   like, hey, everything kind of revolves around the weekend,
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.580]   and I can't make that change 'cause I'm going out here.
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.820]   People build their lives.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.660]   They change everything about their lives
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.040]   around making more money.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.900]   I'm gonna move to this city, I'm gonna do that job.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.460]   People build their lives on a lot of things.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.500]   He says, for Christians,
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.940]   they are to build their lives around Christ,
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.220]   and surround themselves with other people
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.500]   who build their lives around Christ.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.780]   As we say often, man, you gotta change your playmates
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.240]   and your playground, that you build your life around Christ,
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.860]   which involves, by the way,
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.580]   being surrounded by other people
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:29.580]   who are building their life around Christ.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.020]   Change your playmates and playgrounds,
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.100]   or change your team and your teammates,
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.020]   to use the sports analogy from earlier.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.660]   Peter says, if you wanna experience your purpose,
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.580]   it won't happen by you just coming on a Tuesday
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.620]   and being sincere, and I love the music, and this is great,
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.420]   but it will not happen if you just leave here
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.220]   and you go back to the same friends,
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.980]   go back to the same toxic relationships,
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.700]   the same friends who are not trying to lift you up,
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.100]   but are pulling you down,
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.780]   even though they don't even realize it.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.860]   Nobody's like intentionally like,
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.780]   dude, I gotta pull you down.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.100]   They just, by their presence
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.140]   and what they're inviting you to participate in,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.100]   are going to, and Peter says,
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.740]   you won't experience your purpose, you won't grow,
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.500]   and you will miss out on what God has created
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.460]   and given you salvation for.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.460]   You're missing out on life if you're not connected
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.420]   and being built up with a together on Christ.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.060]   He finishes and gives us the last thing,
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.780]   and it's a part of just this new life
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.540]   and the purpose that we have for it,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.340]   a part of our purpose
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.580]   as those who have the new life in Christ.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:30.940]   He says this in verse nine,
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.740]   but you are a chosen people,
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:40.660]   a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession.
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.460]   He chose you, you're this holy royal priesthood.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.940]   He identifies all these different figurative expressions
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.780]   of the Old Testament.
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.260]   In other words, the Old Testament
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.620]   had three authority figures,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.140]   the priest, the king, and the prophet,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.340]   and Peter says, man, there's no more elites
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.300]   in God's kingdom.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.740]   You're a royal priesthood.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.340]   It's like you make up part of the king.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:01.660]   It's like you make up part of the priesthood.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.020]   He's about to say you declare, which is what a prophet do.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.460]   In Christ, there's no elites.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.380]   It's level ground.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.600]   Christ has made something new, and he chose you,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.820]   not chose you because of you.
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.500]   He chose you in spite of you and in spite of me,
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.620]   and you are God's special or treasured possession,
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.860]   he says when he looks at you,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.220]   and he says that he chose you for a reason,
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.780]   which is this, end of verse nine,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.380]   chose that you would declare the praises of him
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.400]   who called you out of darkness
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.940]   and into his wonderful light.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.160]   Once you were not a people, but now you are a people.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.600]   Once you had not received mercy,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.200]   but now you have received the mercy of God,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.440]   that he gives us our third idea,
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.160]   which is God chose you for a reason.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.760]   There's a purpose behind it,
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.280]   specifically that you would declare the praises
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.080]   of him who called you out of darkness
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.280]   and into his marvelous light.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.600]   Our third idea from the text is like,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.380]   what's the third component of experiencing your purpose?
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.440]   The first one is growing up.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.040]   You've gotta grow up by knowing God's word
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.840]   and having others around you, God's people around you.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.660]   The second one is that you're built up together.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.960]   You're meant to be connected to the body of Christ.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.480]   And the third one comes from sharing the message of Christ.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.280]   You grow up in Christ, you're built together on Christ,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.420]   and now we as those who've been chosen,
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.360]   we go share the message of Christ.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.840]   All three are deeply a part of your purpose.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.440]   You will not experience it apart from this.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.400]   He says that I saved you to go send you out into the world.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.440]   I saved you not just so that you would sit in your chair
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.480]   and that you'd sing some songs,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.560]   but that you would now be able to go out
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.680]   into the places you work, in the places that you live,
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.000]   in the family tables that you sit at,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.860]   to every single place that you would begin to go declare,
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.400]   not the praises of watermark or the porch or of yourself
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.520]   or of whatever skills and abilities you have,
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.760]   but you would declare the praises of Christ
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.320]   or of Jesus, of God, the one who called you out of darkness,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.520]   who changed your life if you're a Christian.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.160]   At the heart of your purpose is this idea
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.620]   of sharing the Christian message.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.640]   Or you may have heard it called evangelism,
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.360]   that you would go and you'd go tell people
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.920]   about what God has done for you.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.040]   You will not experience your purpose if you said,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.140]   nope, I'm definitely not gonna go do that.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.480]   I think some of the barriers, honestly,
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.800]   to where why we don't go share the message
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.440]   are maybe the most helpful things to talk through,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.280]   'cause here's some of the things
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.360]   that I feel like I hear all the time about,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.120]   like, dude, I'm just not very good at that,
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.160]   I get so uncomfortable, I get my palms are sweating right now
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.640]   thinking about it, and all that's understandable.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.600]   And then some of them come,
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.040]   I wrote down some of the barriers that I'll hear,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.060]   like, hey, man, I just, I'm not perfect,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.040]   so I feel like if I go share,
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.440]   I gotta have it all together.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.700]   You're not perfect.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.860]   That's the point.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.640]   You can't be a Christian if you say,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.880]   hey, just, you wanna worship my God?
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.840]   I'm perfect.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   No one who is a Christian has that message.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.120]   You're not a Christian if you think that.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.720]   A person, a Christian is somebody who says,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.880]   I'm not perfect.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.120]   I have a perfect Savior, I'm imperfect.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.760]   I imperfectly love Him now,
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.960]   I've imperfectly lived in my past,
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.800]   and I'll imperfectly live in my future,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.000]   but I have a perfect Savior
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.980]   who is driving out the fear in my life
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.400]   with His perfect love, and I'm finding freedom in Him.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.720]   That's the message of Christianity,
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.120]   you being like, hey, but I'm not perfect,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.320]   and I just feel like I don't have it.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.360]   That's the point, just say to your coworkers,
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.920]   look, I'm a hypocrite,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.100]   but do you know that Jesus died for you on the cross,
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.100]   just like He died for my hypocrisy, for my sin in my life?
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.140]   And whoever just trusts in Him will have eternal life?
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.080]   That's what you do.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.720]   The fact that you're not perfect isn't a barrier,
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.400]   it's a platform, if anything.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.840]   He goes, another one is that, like, man,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.060]   well, I'm just introverted,
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.020]   or I don't have the gift of evangelism.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.640]   I don't know that it matters.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.920]   I mean, no one would say, like, ah, yeah,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.960]   don't, yeah, don't experience your purpose, that's fine.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.800]   You live your whole life and be purposeless.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.840]   You're an introvert.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.220]   No one would say that's okay, right?
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.360]   Like, how tragic is it if somebody's like,
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.820]   no, I just can't, I cannot,
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.700]   I'm stepping up to the line of the purpose for my existence,
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.620]   and I think I'm good.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.420]   I'm gonna go sit in a corner by myself
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.020]   and experience introvertedness.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.620]   Like, that's so crazy.
[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:02.500]   But I, like, resonate, I have a heart for that,
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.260]   because I think some of the reasons why introverts,
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.740]   or all of us could struggle with sharing,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.860]   is because we just don't know exactly how.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.620]   How do you get into the conversation?
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.980]   How do I do it in a way that's not just weird and awkward,
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.220]   and they're like, oh, man, that guy,
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.900]   just Jesus juked me, and he's like, is that coffee hot?
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.740]   You know what's really hot?
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.580]   Hell.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.180]   Have you heard of how you don't have to go there?
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.660]   Like, how do you do it in a way that's not awkward
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.860]   and not that way?
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.400]   But that may be gold, man.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.040]   Somebody try that, and it may work.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.880]   We'll be like.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.220]   Gotta keep going.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.380]   How do you get in the conversation?
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.900]   Here's some things, like, super tactically,
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.780]   this was so helpful to me.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.060]   I remember, like, moving to Watermark eight years ago,
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.120]   and it was the place that I'd never seen
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.220]   just examples of what this looks like so well.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.380]   JP being one of them, it's one of the best in the world
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.200]   that I know of.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.700]   Todd has just created, our senior pastor's created
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.340]   a culture on here that's so good.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.140]   I remember hearing just tactical sentences
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.800]   that helped me so much more get in the conversation.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.260]   Things like this, that I use all the time,
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.380]   which is any time they were out and about,
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.940]   asking the question, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:07.000]   Like, do you have a faith?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.340]   And they'll go, what, of what?
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.840]   Do you have faith, like a belief, a religion?
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.700]   And they'll either go, yes, I do, it's X,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.740]   or no, I don't, or I did growing up, and you're N.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.820]   Oh, cool, hey, can I tell you what I believe?
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.940]   Things like this, I mean, this happened a few weeks ago
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.400]   at a friend that I was talking with
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.340]   that worked at Barnes & Noble,
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.220]   and we were talking about faith
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.060]   and talking about Christianity, and he was like,
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.180]   nah, man, I don't really do that.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.080]   And I just said, man, hey, you're clearly an educated guy.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.280]   Do you know what the central message of the Bible is?
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.120]   Like, if you were to, like, distill it into a sentence,
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.940]   I mean, I know you're clearly intelligent,
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.540]   so I'm sure you'd wanna know if you don't know,
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.740]   but do you know what it is?
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.140]   And he was like, man, I don't know if I could exactly put it
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.900]   you know, God and a religious system.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.020]   Hey, let me tell you,
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:51.860]   the central message of the Bible is this,
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.220]   that God created the world.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:57.100]   Man disobeyed God and he introduced sin.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.300]   And God, rather than allow man to keep running from him
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.380]   and keep rebelling him, or just to kill him
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.160]   and wipe him out, decided that he would become a man
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.780]   and that he would die for the creation,
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:12.940]   the mankind that he made in his image,
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.660]   the creation he's crazy about.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:20.560]   Essentially, in a few words, it's God loved, so God gave.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.300]   That's the message of Christianity.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.140]   Messages are questions like, hey, you know, I mean,
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.060]   I feel like there's just little tactical things
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:29.980]   that are super helpful.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.120]   Easter's about to come up.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.300]   Here's what you can do at your table.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.660]   You're eating dinner, you're eating breakfast,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.220]   you're coming, there's a waiter that comes up.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.980]   Hey, we were just talking about Easter.
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.340]   And, you know, what do you think?
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.980]   So Jesus dies, do you think he rises from the dead or not?
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.860]   It's a common, it's like a current event
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.460]   that's taking place in culture.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:46.820]   Immediately ask him, or ask him,
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.140]   they're not gonna be like, what the,
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.460]   here's your food, unbelievable!
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.140]   This is crazy!
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.460]   They're gonna go, oh, man, I don't know, man,
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.580]   I don't know, and you just go, hey, can I tell you
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.060]   that I believe that he rose from the dead?
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.220]   Here's why that's important.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.700]   Because the Bible doesn't teach good people go to heaven
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.260]   and forgiven, or I mean, and bad people go to hell.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.100]   It doesn't teach good people in heaven, bad people no.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.060]   It teaches forgiven people go to heaven.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.460]   And there's only one way to get forgiveness.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.980]   Bad people get forgiveness, good people,
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.220]   by our standards, get forgiveness.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.460]   But it can only happen one way,
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.020]   which is trusting in Jesus and what he did on the cross,
[00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.500]   dying for you and rising again.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.860]   Why do I believe that Jesus came back alive?
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.180]   One, because he changed my life,
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.900]   but two, 'cause it's at the heart
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.540]   of what the Bible and the gospel teaches.
[00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.040]   If he didn't rise from the dead,
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.300]   we worship a guy who just died.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.280]   Everybody dies.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.940]   We worship a guy who conquered death,
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.680]   and he changed the world, and he's changing my world.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.020]   Would you like to come to Easter?
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:54.340]   That coffee's hot.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.340]   [audience laughing]
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.620]   Or just, this is another barrier that people have.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.780]   So I don't know how to get in the conversation.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.380]   There's a couple different ways
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.660]   to get into the conversation.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.420]   But even, I mean, just think about this.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.820]   Here's the problem with most people.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.580]   And if you're like, dude, this doesn't work for me,
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.420]   it kind of works for you,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.500]   here's all I want to challenge you to do.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.660]   If you don't ever share your faith,
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.860]   here's the challenge for you.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.180]   Just begin to think about,
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.140]   if you were gonna share your faith in a situation,
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.700]   what could it possibly look like?
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.420]   Your coworker's sitting there talking about
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.700]   how hopeless the situation in his personal life is.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.860]   Maybe you begin to go, man, if I was gonna share,
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.900]   I'm not going to, but if I was, I would be like,
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.980]   you know what, I've found hope in the midst of stuff.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.780]   That's been my faith in Christ.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.020]   Yeah, that's how I think I would do it.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.900]   Not gonna do it, but that's how I would do it.
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.540]   Just begin to think about it.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.380]   All I'm asking you to do, I'm daring you,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.420]   step up to the edge for the purpose of your existence
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.980]   and just take a look over to see what it could look like
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.940]   on the other side.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.060]   It's at the heart of why you have your faith.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:00.780]   Peter says, look, you're given this salvation
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.300]   to proclaim about the God who saved you,
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.700]   called you out of darkness.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.220]   Not smart enough, maybe you're going, man,
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:11.500]   I don't know evolution and tectonic plates or dinosaurs.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.340]   Here's what no one can deny, no one can debate,
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.640]   your own story.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.460]   This is what Christ has done in my life
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.480]   and what he's doing in my life.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.820]   We teach our volunteers how to share in three minutes
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.540]   their testimony, we call it,
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.540]   which is one minute on before I met Christ,
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.580]   one minute on how I met Christ,
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.020]   and one minute on since I've met Christ,
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.460]   how he's either saved me and the things he saved me from,
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.660]   and also he's continuing to work in my life.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.260]   And if you're a Christian in the room,
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.300]   nobody can debate that.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.860]   They can debate evolution all day long.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.020]   They can't debate that.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.620]   And Peter says, man, you're just telling people
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.020]   the way that God has worked inside of your life.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.900]   The final thing that Peter points out
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.260]   is we do this together.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.340]   The way that we spread the message of Christianity
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.740]   is we just go around together,
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.060]   like we're stronger together.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.420]   I'm more likely to share my faith
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.740]   when I'm with brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.360]   out and about.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.540]   I'm more likely to share my faith,
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.100]   even if I'm by myself, you know,
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.980]   doing, running errands or whatever it is,
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.940]   if I have people encouraging me
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.700]   and holding me accountable
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.260]   and raising that banner in front of me
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.900]   in my own community group, which they are,
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.460]   that we're all more likely to do this,
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.180]   we're all less likely to do it alone,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.180]   and we're all more likely to do it
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.020]   when we come together.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:22.940]   Peter says plural, the you in that,
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.100]   but you is a plural, it's y'all,
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.620]   or you all, if you will.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.300]   And he says y'all are a chosen race
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.900]   to declare the praises of God.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.140]   All of you together is what the church
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.780]   is intended to be, just go around declaring,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.140]   not how amazing you are,
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.100]   how amazing is our God.
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.960]   He doesn't demand anything from you.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.180]   He's done something for you,
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.240]   and we take that message every place.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.860]   We tell people that the Bible doesn't teach
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.500]   whosoever behaves shall not perish,
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.340]   but have eternal life.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.660]   It says whosoever believes
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.420]   will not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.780]   And we take that message to the streets of Dallas,
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.180]   the streets of Fort Worth, every place.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.020]   Because we're perfect?
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.660]   No, because we found someone who is,
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.100]   and he is working inside of our life,
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.100]   he's growing us, he's building us together
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.580]   as a priesthood, and he has allowed us
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.260]   just the privilege to be a part of sharing
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.740]   and taking his message across the world.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.200]   I'll finish with just this last verse,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.540]   which is verse 10, where it says this.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.240]   Once you were not a people,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.700]   but now you are God's people.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.020]   Once you had not received mercy,
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.260]   but now you have received mercy.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.080]   I love this.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:39.420]   Peter finishes this passage with a direct quote
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.580]   from the book of Hosea.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.620]   Like this isn't like a made up thing.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.180]   He literally, he rips it out.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.880]   He plagiarizes from Hosea,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.720]   and he takes it and he says,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.100]   "This was a prophecy given that's been fulfilled here."
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.980]   What's the prophecy?
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:55.300]   What's going on in the book of Hosea?
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.180]   Hosea is a book of the Bible that contains this story
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.500]   where God comes to this prophet,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.900]   who in prophets were these people
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.940]   that God would basically speak to the nation
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:04.980]   through the prophet.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.580]   He was there, "Hey, I'm gonna come speak to the nation
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.260]   "through you and through your life.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.780]   "I'm gonna showcase myself to them."
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.860]   And God comes to Hosea, and it's at this time
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.560]   when the nation of Israel has run from God.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.140]   The nation of Israel is what the Old Testament
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.220]   is all about, and it's the story,
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.180]   or inside of the story of Hosea,
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.700]   it's where the nation has basically said,
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.740]   "We're done with God.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.980]   "We're gonna go worship other gods.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.740]   "We're gonna do whatever we want."
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.440]   And God comes to Hosea, and he says,
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.140]   "I want you to go marry a prostitute.
[00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.780]   "I want you to go marry a woman directly."
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.740]   It says in verse two of chapter one of Hosea,
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.020]   that when the Lord first spoke to Hosea,
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.200]   he said, "Go and take yourself a wife of Horeb,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.500]   "and I want you to have children of Horeb,
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.760]   "for the land commits Horeb by forsaking the Lord."
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.780]   And it tells us that he goes and he marries this prostitute.
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.200]   I mean, this is the scene where Hosea is going,
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.260]   "Man, am I sure this is God right now?
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.000]   "This really sounds like the devil.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.880]   "He's telling me to marry a prostitute named Gomer?
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.940]   "They don't even have a cool prostitute name.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.940]   "Gomer?
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.820]   "Like cinnamon or magic or something, Gomer."
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.500]   And God says, "I want you to for a very specific reason."
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.300]   (laughing)
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.620]   "I want you to," magic.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.120]   "I want you to for a very specific reason, keep away.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:26.220]   "Because in doing so, she is going to cheat on you
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.220]   "over and over and over and over again.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.060]   "You're gonna marry this woman
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.060]   "and she's gonna cheat on you time after time.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.380]   "She's gonna go sleep with other men.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.220]   "And I'm gonna put it in your heart to love her,
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.300]   "and you're gonna go after her
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.980]   "every single time she's gonna run from you.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.740]   "Here's why, because you will show the world,
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.440]   "you'll show the nation of Israel.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.940]   "You will show how I feel when my people turn to other gods.
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.400]   "Now my heart breaks.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.420]   "And the same love that I'll never stop loving you
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.160]   "is I'm gonna put in your heart, Hosea,
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.660]   "you're gonna go after Gomer.
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.080]   "Just like I love them."
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.980]   The scripture tells us that eventually
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.460]   she's running away from God,
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.100]   and, or she's running away from Hosea,
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.380]   and she's sleeping with these different men.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.980]   And one day, she comes back home and she's pregnant.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.820]   And she gives birth to a little baby girl.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.180]   And God says, "I want you to call him,
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.520]   "or call her, Lo-Ami, not my people.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.260]   "Because my people have said, you're not our God."
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.620]   She keeps sleeping around and eventually comes back,
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.060]   she's pregnant again with some other guy's baby.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.660]   And he says, "Call the boy this time,
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.820]   "Lo-Ramah, not receive the mercy."
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.960]   She continues to sleep around,
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.020]   and she continues to go so far as eventually
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.460]   she sells herself into prostitution.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.940]   She becomes the property of another man.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.860]   And Hosea eventually hears that,
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:57.180]   "Man, where's my wife, who I love?"
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.020]   And he finds out that she's been sold,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.120]   she's like on an auction block to be sold.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.140]   And the Spirit of God comes, Hosea chapter three,
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.360]   and it says that the Lord came to Hosea and said,
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   "Go and love a woman who's an adulteress."
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:19.460]   Just like the love of the Lord for the nation of Israel.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.640]   Though they turn their backs and they commit idolatry,
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.740]   and they run towards other gods.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.700]   "Go love her again, Hosea."
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.740]   And he goes and loves her.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.400]   He sees her on the auction block.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.380]   And he sees, I mean, she's about to be sold.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.220]   Somebody's standing there like,
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.660]   "Hey, what's the highest price I'll take you?"
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:35.220]   He says, "Man, that's my wife.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.500]   "This is how much she costs.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.440]   "He doesn't even have enough money."
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.620]   So he takes these 15 shekels,
[00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.940]   we're told he takes all the money that he has,
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:47.820]   and he has to go home and like get some of his stuff
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.940]   and be like, "Will you take this?
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.580]   "I've got this money and we take this stuff.
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:53.340]   "Whatever the price, I'll pay it."
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.300]   And he sets her free.
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.700]   And inside of the book of Hosea, this prophecy is given.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.540]   These exact words where Peter picks up
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.040]   and years later, the Holy Spirit says,
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.900]   "This prophecy is now fulfilled."
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.260]   Inside of the story where Hosea, just like God,
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.740]   in the story, we're Gomer, God is Hosea,
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.960]   who after time and time again of us running from him says,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.680]   "Whatever the price, I'll pay it.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.000]   "My son, I'll pay it.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.760]   "This is how much I love you.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.160]   "This is how much I love the human race.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.180]   "Though they run from me, though they rebel from me,
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.700]   "though they turn their back on me,
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.560]   "whatever the price, I'll pay it."
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:35.820]   And he says inside of this book, man, I love this.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.040]   He speaks of this day and he says,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.280]   "There will come a day where these children
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.000]   "that we've named not my people
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.260]   "and have not received mercy,"
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.860]   just like they're illegitimate children,
[00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.940]   just like they're undeserving, just like their mother.
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.180]   Yet despite all of it, I love them.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.780]   Despite all of it, Hosea loves them.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.920]   He says inside of there will come someday,
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.400]   Hosea chapter two, verse 23,
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.540]   someday the Lord says,
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.980]   "I will look on those who I have called not my people
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.400]   "and I will call them my people.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.240]   "I will look on those who I've called not received mercy
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.500]   "or not loved and they will receive mercy."
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.480]   And Peter says, "This prophecy has been filled."
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.560]   This is the message that we go tell people.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.160]   How amazing is the God who's out there?
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.680]   The story of Hosea is all seen most clearly
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.120]   in the story of the cross.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.900]   We are like Gomer.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.220]   We've done nothing but run from God.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.760]   Wherever you are in the room, you're like Gomer.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.720]   Every single person you work next to is like Gomer.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.060]   It's like someone who's turned their back,
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.180]   who's made themself a God,
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.760]   who's chased after things in this world,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.680]   who's tried to get addicted to either pain pills
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.660]   or in their rebellion has gotten addicted
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.760]   to whatever it is, pornography, sexuality,
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.400]   whatever it is, they've run from him.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.520]   And what does God do?
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.480]   What does the heart of God do?
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.140]   He runs after his people.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.480]   Whatever the price, I will pay it so that they will come
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   a day where I will say to those,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.460]   despite the rebellion, despite their undeserving,
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.280]   many of them even think they deserve it.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.000]   That's how broken they are.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.840]   I love them.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.400]   Whatever the price, I'll pay it.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.900]   And he says, Peter says,
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.460]   "That's who we are.
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.700]   "And that's where we go to help people.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.100]   "That's why we go spread the message everywhere.
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:24.180]   "Because the God who is there is greater than anyone
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.500]   "could have ever imagined, has a grander love
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.460]   "than anyone could ever fathom, anyone has ever experienced.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.460]   "And he loves them more than we ever could
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.300]   "and we ever will.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.540]   "And he invites us to be a part of it.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.220]   "Do you know this God?
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.940]   "And be a part of telling them
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.980]   "about the greatness of our God
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.020]   "that Hosea in his relentless pursuit
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.260]   "shows just a fraction of.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.260]   "That's the God who's there.
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.100]   "That's the God we tell people about.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.700]   "That's the God if you ever are to know him,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.380]   "you'll come to know."
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.220]   Let me pray.
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.580]   Father, we,
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:07.020]   there are no words that can describe
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.020]   this love that we feel.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.260]   There are no words
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.700]   for this kind of love.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:21.140]   I can't even begin to understand how someone would sacrifice
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:28.100]   a life, let alone the eternal life of God
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:31.100]   for someone as lowly as us,
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.700]   who despite just being your creation made in your image,
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.380]   would love incredibly so much so
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:41.380]   that you would give your life, whatever the price.
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.940]   Would you kindle just that story, that message,
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.740]   that truth inside of my heart, Lord?
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.540]   Would we be more able and more readily just
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:57.460]   able to share of how incredibly good our God is?
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.220]   How amazing is his love?
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.340]   There's no love like this in other faiths.
[00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.740]   There's no love like this in this world.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.500]   It's found in one place, which is you, Lord.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.180]   Would you allow us to be your messengers
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.740]   to experience our purpose,
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.740]   which is to know you and to make you known
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.460]   for anyone inside of this room who, like me,
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:20.900]   can easily cower and not be bold to share
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.340]   the hope that you alone offer?
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.820]   Would you win, Lord?
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.180]   And where we're weak in our hearts,
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.020]   would you conquer that?
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:31.860]   Would your perfect love cast out fear?
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.700]   Father, we love you.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.780]   We thank you that you have given us the privilege
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.380]   of knowing you and walking with you.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.340]   We worship you, amen.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:40.840]   Amen.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   Thank you.
