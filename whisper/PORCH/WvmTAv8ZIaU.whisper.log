[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:31.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.340]   Porch, how we doing? We doing OK tonight?
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.700]   Great to see you.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.340]   You look good as always.
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.740]   Hey, I'm really eager for where the Lord is taking us
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.380]   this evening.
[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.880]   But before we get into it, I do want
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.740]   to give a special shout out to all of Porch Live
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.660]   that is joining us from all over the nation.
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.740]   We genuinely believe-- and I'm going to speak right
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.240]   into the camera here for a minute--
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.860]   that God can meet with anyone, anytime, in any place,
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.820]   including you.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.900]   And so we're so glad that you would tune in with us here
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.400]   this evening.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.060]   Special shout out to Porch Live Des Moines, Porch Live Boise,
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.140]   and Porch Live Scottsdale.
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.660]   So glad that y'all are joining us here
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.380]   and with what God's doing.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.540]   Well, when I was in high school, our youth group
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.180]   would take a backpacking trip to Colorado
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.420]   every couple of years.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420]   So over the course of my high school time,
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.180]   I was able to go on three different trips.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.460]   Now, the first time I went on a backpacking trip,
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.860]   I was totally inexperienced.
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.420]   I didn't know anything about what I was to expect
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.620]   or what it looked like to hike up a mountain.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.420]   You see, I had gone camping before,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.500]   but I'd never been backpacking before.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.060]   And so I was absolutely dependent upon people around me.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.760]   I didn't know what kind of gear to bring
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.180]   or what kind of food to pack.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.140]   I showed up, and I just expected people
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.500]   to help me along the way.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.340]   But what I found as I showed around
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.540]   for my third and final trip, I had a little bit more
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.780]   experience under my belt.
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.460]   I knew what it looked like to scope out a really good campsite,
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.780]   how to predict and endure the elements.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660]   I knew what gear to bring.
[00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.020]   I knew exactly what it looked like to make your way up
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.980]   an ideal trail.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.460]   I could strategically map myself up a mountain.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.980]   I felt like my days of being a novice to the trail
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.100]   were behind me.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.820]   And I was at last one with the wilderness.
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.900]   When you go backpacking, there's a variety of things
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.060]   that you need to make sure you bring with you.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.940]   The normal, everyday, standard packing list.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.620]   You need things like a rain jacket, a sleeping bag.
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.540]   You need a beanie to put on 'cause it may be cold
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.660]   in the mornings and the evenings.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.380]   You need to make sure that you also bring hiking boots.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020]   And there's just a whole list
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.060]   that you need to make sure you have.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.780]   Things that we could probably predict
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.980]   if we pass the microphone around.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.540]   We could make sure that we map it all out.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.340]   But one thing that I brought with me
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.300]   that was not so standard to the packing list
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.840]   is I brought with me a toilet seat.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.700]   Which may feel odd.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.060]   That may feel odd, I know.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.540]   But this was a luxury that I had parted ways with
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.860]   in years past.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.420]   And yet this time, in my ingenuity,
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.060]   I knew that I could bring one with me.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.540]   That I could actually buy one from the store.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.580]   I could fasten it to a frame.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.300]   I could attach it to my pack
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.500]   and I could utilize it with dual functionality.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.540]   It could be my lawn chair when sitting around the campfire,
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.820]   as well as my lavatory, whatever nature called.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.060]   I made sure to bring a toilet seat with me.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.380]   Which you might hear and think, man, that is brilliant.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.020]   And my 18 year old self would have tended to agree.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.780]   Except for the fact that it kind of hurt my credibility
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.460]   as the mountain man that I aspired to be.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.980]   Because the other wilderness guides,
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.380]   the ones that were particularly leading my group,
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.360]   they thought I was just trying to be funny.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.780]   They looked at me and they saw something
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.840]   that was abnormal to the normal mountain hiking experience.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.700]   And so as they looked upon my outfitting gear,
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.540]   they said, man, this doesn't look normal.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.100]   And so my credibility took a shot as did my ego.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.820]   And what I realized is I did look out of place to them
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.820]   because you see, it doesn't make sense in their world
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.900]   for me to hike up a mountain with something
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.500]   so uncharacteristically typical of the experience.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.020]   You see, I had aspired to a new way of life,
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.860]   to climbing up this hiking trail.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.660]   But I was carrying along strapped to my pack
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.520]   something from my old way of life.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.860]   I had set out into the wild,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.220]   but I was carrying with me a piece of the city.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.920]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.940]   Because in the same way, when we walk with Jesus,
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.960]   we look equally confusing.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.020]   When we claim a new life in Christ,
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.720]   but we have a piece of our old self strapped on.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.500]   We walk into the world and people see what we say,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.260]   and yet they look at different aspects of who we are
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.860]   and it looks inconsistent.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:59.700]   It looks confusing.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   It looks funny to the way in which we now claim to live.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.100]   You see Colossians 1:13,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.860]   what Paul unpacked for us in the very first chapter
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.140]   of this letter that we've been working through
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.940]   is that God has delivered us from the domain of darkness
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.260]   and he has transferred us into the kingdom
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.860]   of his beloved son.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.300]   He has transferred us, he has transplanted us,
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.260]   he has relocated us from one place to another place,
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.760]   from death into life.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.300]   In the same way that you would transplant a heart.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.140]   What do you do?
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.660]   You take it from a dead body
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.660]   and you put it into a living body.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.500]   So has Christ done with us.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.940]   He has taken us from a dead set of circumstances
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.140]   and he has moved us into a living set of circumstances.
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.320]   And because that's true,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.180]   there's a way in which we should live.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.580]   Like our whole life should characteristically,
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.740]   fundamentally look different
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.260]   and there should be nothing about us
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.980]   that is consistent with our old way of life.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.140]   Instead, we should be moving forward
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.220]   in a manner that accords with who he is himself.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.140]   So the question for us tonight is what does that look like?
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.380]   And how do we know if in fact we're actually living in it?
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   That's the question we're addressing.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.520]   And in order to do it,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.120]   we're gonna be working through Colossians chapter three.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.180]   So if you have a Bible, you can grab it.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.420]   Scripture is gonna be on the screens as well.
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.100]   So you can look at it there if you want.
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.780]   But as we make our way through Colossians chapter three,
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.680]   Paul is gonna help us identify, do we look the part?
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.200]   Do we look like Jesus?
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.700]   If our life is now hidden in him,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.280]   is the way in which we're living consistent
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.900]   with that new reality?
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.540]   What you also need to know is that tonight,
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.660]   we're gonna cover 17 total verses.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.460]   That's a lot of page to cover.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.980]   And so we're gonna be flying over it at 30,000 feet.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.740]   We're not gonna get down into the weeds of it all.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.460]   We'll drip down occasionally
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.540]   just to catch a couple of small details,
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.780]   but we're gonna fly over it
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.460]   because I just want you to catch the main strokes
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.600]   of what Paul is writing for us.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.180]   And then lastly, what you need to know
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.300]   is that the main point of the book of Colossians,
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.500]   which I have hammered and hammered and hammered
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.180]   over the last several weeks since we've been in this series
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.500]   is that if you want greater maturity in life,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.320]   you need greater clarity of Christ.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.260]   If you want greater maturity in life,
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.340]   which so many of us do,
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.980]   like we're okay with who we are,
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.380]   but we wanna be more.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.860]   Like we wanna aspire to a new level.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.680]   If that's you, if you want maturity,
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.520]   then the way you get there is you get clarity.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.700]   And Paul knows it.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.780]   That's why as we've been walking
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.980]   through the book of Colossians chapter one and chapter two
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.080]   are all about seeing Jesus.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.020]   That's what it's about.
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.420]   Colossians one and two, it's all doctrinal in nature.
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.620]   Chapter one, it's all about the supremacy of Jesus.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.620]   Chapter two, it's all about the sufficiency of Jesus.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.060]   And yet, as you come to chapter three,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.760]   like a hinge on a door,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.900]   we transition from a doctrinal set of teaching
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.340]   to a practical set of teaching.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.540]   Now that you have clarity,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.860]   let's move into maturity.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.020]   That's Paul's point.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.760]   That's where he's going this evening.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.000]   That's what he wants to help us understand.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.100]   And so this is what he says.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.580]   He begins to unpack what it looks like
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.680]   to be a mature follower of Jesus.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.580]   He says in verse one,
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.520]   "If then you've been raised with Christ,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.500]   seek the things that are above.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.480]   Where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.320]   set your minds on things that are above
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.900]   and not on things that are on the earth.
[00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.920]   For you have died and your life is hidden
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.800]   with Christ in God.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.520]   When Christ who is your life appears,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.400]   then you also will appear with him in glory."
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.560]   Paul starts with what seems like such a simple statement,
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.160]   and yet it is loaded with so much truth.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.480]   It's so very profound.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.760]   He says, "If then you've been raised with Christ,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.880]   then set your mind."
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.280]   He gives us a conditional statement.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   It's if this has happened, then do this instead.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.440]   You see, what he knows is the implications
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.080]   that if we are now raised with Christ,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.560]   we must have died with Christ.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.960]   That's the only way that you can rise.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.120]   You have to die before you can rise.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.200]   That's what he unpacked in Colossians 2, verse 20.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.800]   He said, "If with Christ,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.040]   you die to the elemental spirits of the world."
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.880]   Why?
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.000]   "As if you were still alive in the world,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.720]   do you submit to regulations?"
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.480]   You're no longer alive in the world.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.080]   You're alive in Jesus.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.140]   And since it's the case, you should look like Jesus.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.360]   So what does that look like?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.640]   Well, the first thing he tells us
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.560]   is that we should set our minds on the meaningful
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.240]   and not the momentary.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.920]   Set your mind on the meaningful and not the momentary.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.960]   If you're doing a Christian fit check,
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.000]   if you're walking up to the mirror
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.840]   and you're trying to evaluate,
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.760]   "Do I look like Jesus?"
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.840]   This is the first thing,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.320]   because he set his mind on the meaningful
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.400]   and not the momentary, and we should do so similarly.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.880]   You see, we have been transitioned
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.560]   from one state of being to a new state of being.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.880]   It was a cause and effect statement.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.780]   If you've been raised, so then set your mind.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.040]   Like we said earlier,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.560]   there was a true transplantation of you
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   from a life in the dark to now a life in the light.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.960]   So it's kind of like this.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.260]   When you move into a brand new home,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.360]   that home has absolutely no power.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.560]   And so it's unlivable, right?
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.440]   That home has no power until you choose to turn it on.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.600]   And when you turn it on, that house is coursing with power.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.840]   Like now it's alive.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.600]   Now it is livable.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.440]   And yet, how do you know that the house is alive?
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.560]   Not just by turning the power on,
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.300]   but by turning a light on, by flipping the switch.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.280]   You see, in the same way, salvation is like,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.640]   God has stepped into your life
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.000]   and he has turned the power on.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.640]   And yet, as we now walk with Jesus,
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.000]   we flip one switch after the next.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.240]   And as we flip those switches,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.080]   what happens is we see evidence of that power in our life.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.280]   We see that we are becoming more like him.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.380]   We see proof of the power in us.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.080]   That's what Paul's talking about.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.520]   That's what he's getting at when he says,
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.920]   "Hey, you should increasingly set your mind
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.760]   "on things that are above.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.320]   "You should flip one switch and then the next switch
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.160]   "and then the next switch.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.380]   "And you should turn all the lights on
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.480]   "because you have a power within your midst,
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.200]   "within your life that is characteristic of Jesus."
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.240]   He uses a word in Greek called phreno.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.440]   Phreno is really interesting.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.780]   That's the word he uses to set your mind.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.080]   It's interesting because it incorporates
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.800]   both aspects of thinking.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.980]   It incorporates the cognitive aspect of thinking,
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.840]   as well as the instinctive aspect of thinking.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.040]   So what he's saying is that you should set your mind
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.960]   in a way where you consider the information
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.400]   you have about Jesus,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:55.120]   as well as the inspiration you have from his life.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.040]   You need facts to know and you need fuel to burn on.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.020]   That's what you should do.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.720]   You should set your mind in such a way
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.000]   that that is happening for you.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.720]   So how do you set your mind?
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.000]   What does that actually look like?
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.040]   You read his word.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.480]   Thank you, Kylan, for telling me something I already knew.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.740]   Now you read his word, not occasionally, but daily.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.520]   And you read his word, not casually, but intentionally.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.400]   And you pray to him, not just heaping up requests.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.800]   Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.200]   Help me, help me, help me.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.360]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.660]   No, you don't just pray to him your requests.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.520]   You pray to him in such a way
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.240]   that simply enjoys the pleasure of his company.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.560]   That just simply chooses to need nothing from him
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   other than he himself.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.340]   You ask hard questions.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.000]   Anybody in here ever had a hard question
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.920]   that the Bible raised?
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.960]   Ask it.
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.280]   But don't pawn the work of answering it off
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.720]   on someone else's interpretation.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.600]   You go do the work yourself.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.040]   You go spend time and you chase down the answers
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.320]   because what's gonna happen
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.600]   is you're going to acquire new information about Jesus
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.320]   and you're gonna acquire new inspiration about Jesus
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.440]   and you're gonna begin to set your mind
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.920]   in a way that leads you to consider him as better.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.600]   That's what he's pointing to.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.200]   You're gonna set your mind on the meaningful
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.900]   and not the momentary.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.320]   Why does this matter?
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.720]   Why does it matter what we pay attention to?
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.860]   Because what you behold impacts who you become.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.760]   What you behold impacts who you become,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.900]   which is why so many of us in here,
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.480]   we feel a deep sense of instability in our life.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.140]   Like Isaiah 26, three, it says,
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.440]   "You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.260]   "because he trusts in you."
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.540]   Man, trust sounds great.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.380]   That kind of stability sounds awesome
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.960]   because in my life, I don't have any sense of stability.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.840]   Things feel crazy.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.380]   They feel out of control.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.200]   What then are you focusing on?
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:12.600]   You see, often what we do is we focus on the momentary.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.800]   We think, man, if I get that job, if I advance in my career,
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.300]   then I'm gonna have the kind of life that I want.
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.160]   Or if I get that kind of relationship,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.440]   then I'm gonna get the kind of happiness
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.300]   that I've always wanted.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.560]   Or if I get involved into that kind of network
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.920]   within that social group,
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.860]   I'm gonna afford myself the sort of opportunities
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.680]   I've always wanted.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.120]   Or if I work on my appearance and I slave at the gym
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.120]   and I scrutinize my diet,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.200]   I can get the kind of acceptance that I've always wanted.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.480]   And yet what you find is you're just as unstable
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   and you're just as insecure as you were when you first began.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.080]   Friends, listen to me.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.880]   Like your life is not hidden in your job.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.700]   Your life is not hidden in your relationship.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.200]   It's not hidden in your popularity.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.680]   It's not hidden in the approval of other people.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.560]   It's not hidden in your hobbies
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.760]   and experiences and activities.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.840]   It's not hidden in any of those things.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.560]   Your life is meant to be hidden in Christ.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.520]   That's where it's supposed to be found.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.380]   And so if you feel unstable and tossed about
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.700]   by the winds and waves of this world,
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.560]   it's because you're not focusing on what matters.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.360]   It's because you're not thinking about what's meaningful.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.800]   God, you, you keep him in perfect peace
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.480]   whose mind is stayed on you.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.320]   If he trusts in you.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.760]   I remember when my dad taught me to drive a boat.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.560]   He's like, son, the best way for you to drive
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.080]   a straight line is to pick something out
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.440]   on the shoreline ahead.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.040]   Something that's immovable, that's constant, that's fixed.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.840]   Because if you point yourself at that,
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.340]   if you keep your eyes set there,
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.080]   you will drive a straight line.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.680]   You will have stability in your course.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.620]   What happens when you don't do that?
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.200]   When you look at the waves around
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.040]   or the boats that are passing by,
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.240]   you swerve all over the place.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.640]   And yet, if I keep my eyes fixed on what's immovable,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.340]   on what's constant, if I keep them fixed on Jesus,
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.100]   then I will have stability.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.860]   What you focus on matters.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.300]   So set your mind on what's meaningful.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   Now, some of you, you're in here and you're like, man,
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.180]   Kylan, I am.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:25.060]   I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.980]   like succumbing to the pressure of, of, of, of,
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.220]   of arriving in my career or, or, or falling prey
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.160]   to the opinions and approval of other people.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.560]   I know the dangers of all of those things.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.600]   And I'm not worried about that.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.440]   Like I'm, I'm trying to focus on what's meaningful.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.720]   I am doing everything you said.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.960]   I'm spending time in the word and I'm praying to the Lord.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.560]   And I'm trying to enjoy the sweetness of his company.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.520]   And I am asking hard questions
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.120]   and I'm doing the hard work of answering those myself
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.960]   and not just pawning the work off on someone else.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.840]   I'm trying to do all of it exactly as you're describing.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.520]   And yet I feel so unstable.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.180]   I feel so tossed about.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.860]   I feel so insecure.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.420]   I do not feel strong.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.860]   I do not feel safe.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.580]   This all feels like a hoax.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.080]   What am I doing wrong?
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.100]   Nothing.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.220]   You see, it's not that you've set your mind
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.300]   on the wrong thing.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.520]   It's that you've set your mind on the right thing.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.460]   And he wants you to seek him still more.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.660]   Some of the sweetest moments I've had with the Lord
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.320]   are in those moments where I'm like,
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.700]   God, it's burning up around me.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.500]   Like, help me, please pull me out.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.600]   And yet he won't just chop her on over,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:49.140]   drop back down, scoop me up and then lead me away.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:55.660]   You know, the gospel is that he sees me in my pain
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.140]   and he gets into it with me.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.100]   So if you're struggling,
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.420]   though you have set your mind on what is meaningful,
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.940]   take heart.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.020]   He wants to take you deeper.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.780]   He wants to lead you further.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.540]   He wants to show you something better.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.060]   He's looking at you and he's like, I know it's hard.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.700]   Come on, don't give up, don't quit.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.700]   I've not quit.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.740]   I'm still here.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.700]   I'm still chasing.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.700]   I'm still pursuing.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.700]   Come closer, keep pursuing.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.380]   Don't stop now.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.020]   I'm taking you someplace you never knew to ask
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.180]   in some place you never dared to dream.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.260]   It will be better.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.580]   Keep coming, keep going.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.580]   Don't give up.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.860]   And what we find is as we do,
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.820]   we begin to look more like Jesus,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.660]   which is where Paul continues to go.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.460]   And as we step into verse five,
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.140]   we see, he says this,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.220]   "Put to death therefore what is earthly in you,
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.460]   sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.220]   and covetousness," which is idolatry.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.180]   "On account of these things, the wrath of God is coming
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.940]   in these you too once walked when you were living in them.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.300]   But now, because you have been transferred,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.480]   you must put them all away.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:22.580]   Anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene talk from your mouth.
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.300]   Do not lie to one another,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.860]   seeing that you have put off the old self
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.140]   with its practices and have put on the new self,
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.660]   which is being renewed in the knowledge
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.100]   after the image of its creator.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.540]   Here, there is not Greek and Jews,
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.500]   circumcised and uncircumcised,
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.760]   barbarian, Scythian, slave, free,
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.620]   but Christ is all and he is in all."
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.460]   You see, Jesus, he came to unite
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.180]   a diversity of people together.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.600]   And he wants to bring that diversity into maturity.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.300]   Now, there's a lot that we could say about these verses,
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:52.580]   but as I said at the beginning,
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.380]   I just want us to catch the main movements
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.580]   of Paul's discourse.
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.540]   And so what we see here is that he moves
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.740]   from an indicative statement to an imperative statement.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.580]   Okay?
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.580]   He has helped us to understand our reality.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.380]   He indicated our reality.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.920]   You've been raised with Christ,
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.920]   and therefore he then articulates our activity.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.320]   This is so important and not in my notes.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.060]   I just, I want you to catch it,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.460]   'cause this was my fear.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.100]   We're gonna get into a lot of practicals tonight.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.280]   And all of them tell you how to become like Jesus.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.760]   But here's the thing.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.460]   We talked about it last week.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.940]   Your best effort, the good college try,
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.660]   all the grit you can muster,
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.220]   your own strength will never make you like Jesus.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:50.260]   No, you are already identified in him
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.500]   the minute you place your faith in him.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.180]   You're saved, you're secure, you are one with Christ.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.380]   Your life is hidden in him.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.940]   And it is from there, once the power's on,
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.060]   that then you can become like him.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.420]   That's what all this is.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.920]   You don't just employ a bunch of practical steps,
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.700]   strategic to-dos to arrive at greater Christlikeness.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.720]   That's not how it works.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.000]   You lean to the power of God and his spirit,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.500]   and he will sanctify you.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.020]   But here's what we know.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.980]   What we know is that he gives us two really strong commands.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.100]   He says, "Hey, I've indicated your reality.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.340]   "You're saved, you're in me, you've been raised with Christ.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.420]   "Now here's an articulated activity, two things.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.620]   "Put to death and put away,"
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.460]   which are really strong commands,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.900]   but they're totally appropriate.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.580]   They're absolutely appropriate, why?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.100]   Because if you're no longer dead,
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.940]   then you should put to death
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.340]   those things from your old way of life.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.340]   And if you're now alive in Christ, if you have a new life,
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.440]   then you should not continue observing
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.700]   your old way of living.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.060]   You should put it away.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.660]   That's what he's getting at.
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.620]   Paul's point is this.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.140]   You can't lead a godly life and follow deadly habits.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.100]   You cannot lead a godly life and follow deadly habits
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.340]   because it's contradictory, right?
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.700]   If you have a destination that you want to go to,
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.140]   and you prepare to set off towards that course,
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.780]   and yet your car is in reverse,
[00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.300]   you don't arrive at the finish line,
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.900]   you arrive in a wreck, you know?
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.160]   You find yourself in a massive heaping mess,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.740]   which is exactly what happens
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.880]   when we entertain the very sin
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.820]   that Jesus went to the cross to eradicate.
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.400]   We find ourselves in a wreck.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.940]   We find ourselves in a mess.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.780]   We find ourselves amidst a deathly circumstance.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.600]   In Paul's command here, he uses the Greek word nekro.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.820]   It's the root word for things like necrotic or necrosis,
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:57.680]   which means simply to render weak or to mortify something.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.760]   It's interesting.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.040]   When I read this initially,
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.000]   "Put to death therefore what is earthly within you,"
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.760]   it like kind of motivated me, you know?
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.720]   I was like, "Where's the dragon and how do I slay it?"
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.920]   You know, I was like, "Gonna ride off into battle
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.680]   "and conquer that great foe."
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.360]   I was ready to catch the scent and hunt it down,
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.000]   and yet that's not what he's describing.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.440]   That's not at all what he's articulating.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.640]   You see, this is less a battle royale against your sin,
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.640]   and it is instead a daily denial of self through discipline.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.400]   That's what it means to mortify.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   It means to suffocate something, to smother something,
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.140]   to squash it out.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.600]   That's how you mortify.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.180]   That's the description he gives here
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.920]   when he says, "Put to death."
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.380]   John Owen, in "The Mortification of Sin,"
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.440]   he talks about it like this.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.800]   He says, "Do you mortify?
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.480]   "Do you make it your daily work?
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.360]   "Be always at it whilst you live.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.200]   "Cease not a day from this work."
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.400]   And here's the line,
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.240]   "Be killing sin or it will be killing you."
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.400]   Which means that if you're not fighting your sin,
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.580]   you're losing to it.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.120]   Because sin never turns a blind eye to you.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.600]   It is always watching, it's always waiting.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.600]   The way the Bible describes it,
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.980]   it's like a lion roaming about
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.800]   looking for someone to devour.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.420]   Sin is the ultimate apex predator.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.140]   Like if you go and you study apex predators,
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.000]   which you don't need to 'cause I've done it a little bit,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.100]   what you find is that apex predators
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.160]   have a variety of characteristics and behaviors
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.240]   that help them to snatch their prey,
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.040]   to seize the weak, to harm the defenseless.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.480]   So great white sharks, they blend into their surroundings.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.880]   They're blue from above and they're white from underneath.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.320]   Crocs, they can virtually submerge their entire self.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.600]   That way they can lie and wait for unsuspecting prey.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.920]   Lions, they strategically, skillfully
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.800]   separate the weak from the rest of the herd.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.480]   This is the way in which apex predators work
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.360]   and your sin is doing it to you.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.220]   That's why we don't cozy up to it.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.640]   That's why we don't make friends with it,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.380]   entertain it, belittle it.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:13.480]   We address it for what it is, because it's deadly.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.860]   And it wants to kill you.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.400]   And if you do not kill it first, it may in fact succeed.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.440]   And while we don't have time to get into the detail
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.840]   of each of the vices that Paul gives here,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.180]   I'll say this, he gives two different lists
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.280]   of five vices each.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.240]   The first list are all sexual in nature.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.080]   Sexual immorality, impurity, passion,
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.680]   evil desire, and covetousness.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.240]   The second list he gives, they're all vengeful in nature.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.760]   Anger, wrath, malice, slander,
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.920]   and obscene talk from your mouth.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.120]   Which is fascinating, because neither the idea of sex
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.280]   nor the idea of vengeance is inherently immoral.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.080]   God actually invented both.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.500]   If you think about it, procreation was his idea.
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.640]   We didn't come up with that one.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.840]   Sex was a gift.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.060]   It's a part of his created order.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.560]   And then if you think about vengeance,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.360]   God will avenge any and every wrong at the end of time.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.000]   This is characteristic of him.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.760]   And what's fascinating is because we've been made
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.600]   into his image, it's characteristic of us.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.280]   It's not surprising that sparks fly
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.240]   whenever you're near that special someone.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.440]   You know, it's what you want.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.280]   It makes sense.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.600]   Sex is a good thing.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   And it's not abnormal that you do feel a deep sense
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.200]   of injustice when you see someone wrong
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.320]   that did nothing to deserve it.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.920]   These things, they are intrinsically true of us.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.680]   They're a part of the human psyche.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.020]   So if they're not objectively immoral,
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.320]   how then do they get off the tracks?
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.120]   Like when do they become sinful
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:51.160]   when we're willing to hurt other people to help ourselves?
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.380]   That's what every single one of these vices,
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.360]   all 10 of them describe.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.960]   They are perpetuated upon other people.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.660]   Think about it.
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:05.080]   Lust is using someone else for my personal gratification
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.040]   and revenge is abusing someone else
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.820]   for my personal justification.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:18.680]   And both the source of the sin is selfishness.
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.080]   It's self-seeking, which is what Paul unpacks
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.480]   when he writes a letter to the Romans.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.600]   He says this in Romans 2, six and eight, he says,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.720]   he, talking about God,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.920]   will render to each one according to his works,
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.800]   to those who by patience and well-doing seek for glory
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.480]   and honor and immortality, he will give them eternal life.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.320]   It's great.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.700]   But for those who are self-seeking
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.440]   and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness,
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.980]   there will be wrath and fury,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.460]   which is what Paul means when he gets into verse six.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.620]   He says, it's because of our sin
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.380]   that the wrath of God is coming.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.340]   Why?
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.740]   Why is that the case?
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.740]   Because it is not God's heart to advance himself
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.380]   at the expense of other people.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.880]   It is God's heart to advance people
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.340]   at the expense of himself.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.300]   Let me say it again.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:17.040]   Because there was the gospel,
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.760]   and it is deserving of rejoicing.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.200]   It is not consistent with God's heart
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.140]   to advance himself at the expense of people.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.480]   It is his heart to advance people,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.960]   you and me, at the expense of himself.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.920]   That is what he has done in Christ.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   Jesus, worthy of all glory and honor and praise.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.440]   He gave up his own life.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.680]   He laid himself down.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.240]   He rendered himself as nothing
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.480]   that we might be considered something.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.080]   This is what it's pointing towards.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.680]   This is what Paul is saying.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.520]   So if this is the case, we should do the same.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.660]   Yet, why don't we?
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:12.780]   Because I think that we see sin as dreadful
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:17.680]   only when it's detectable.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.920]   We find sin is dreadful only when it's detectable.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.100]   If nobody knows, no big deal, right?
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.300]   No harm, no foul.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.520]   That's why you delete your search history
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.840]   after you look at things you shouldn't,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.320]   'cause you don't want it to be detected.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.920]   That's why you're nice to their face
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.260]   despite the fact that you did
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.160]   or said some things behind their back,
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.680]   'cause you don't want it to be detectable.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.940]   This is why we tell the half truth
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.000]   instead of the full truth,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.980]   because we don't want our sin to be detectable.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.480]   And yet, here's the fact of the matter.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.700]   Just because nobody knows
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.360]   does not mean that God doesn't.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.280]   God does know.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.880]   He sees it all.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.720]   But Kylan, what if I'm not harming anyone?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.200]   What if I'm not hurting anyone?
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.440]   What if it's just me in my apartment, in my house,
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.520]   and I'm just looking at porn by myself?
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.220]   That's not hurting anybody.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.360]   What if I'm just having one too many on my own?
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.360]   What if I'm just coping to get through the day?
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.680]   Like, what if I'm just...
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.220]   Listen, you may not be hurting someone else,
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.240]   but you are in fact hurting someone,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.640]   and that would be yourself.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.560]   That's why God cares.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.660]   You see, the wrath of God, it's an often mistaken idea,
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.140]   because what we think of when we hear the wrath of God,
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.440]   we think of a big, judgmental, angry God.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.540]   And yet, he is a loving father.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.880]   The degree to which God loves you
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.720]   directly correlates to the degree
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.380]   of the hate he has for your sin.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.520]   Think about it like this.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.080]   What father that is good
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:07.400]   would see their son, their daughter stolen away from them,
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.320]   and not with great ferocity,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.560]   chase down the one that took them from them?
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.200]   This is what God has done.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.740]   God's wrath is poured out on sin,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.320]   because it took you away from him.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.400]   That's why we have to level with the fact
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.240]   that whether we're doing it against someone else,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.000]   or we're doing it to ourself, all of it is against him.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.960]   And yet, the beauty of the gospel
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.960]   is that God has poured out his wrath on your sin
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.360]   in the person of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.840]   that it's no longer stored up for you
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.480]   if you place your faith in him,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.600]   which is why it's such good news
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.560]   that you go free and he takes the hit.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.540]   You cannot lead a godly life and follow deadly habits.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.800]   So what does it look like?
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.940]   Like, how do we actually do this?
[00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.640]   How do we actually address the sin that's in our life?
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:14.820]   You confess it, not part of it, but all of it.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.660]   You fight it.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.820]   You fight it in the context of community,
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.880]   not in isolation nor by yourself.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.580]   And then once these things are done, you move on.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.920]   That's the good news.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.960]   You move on.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.040]   There's grace.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.240]   There's forgiveness.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.560]   You gotta address it.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.120]   You gotta put it to death.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.080]   You must mortify it, smother it, suffocate it,
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.480]   eradicate it from your life,
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.820]   and then when you do, move forward.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.080]   And to the things that Paul describes here at the end,
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.400]   in verse 12, he says this.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.880]   He says, "Put on then, as God's chosen ones,
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.480]   "holy and beloved, compassionate hearts,
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.500]   "kindness, humility, meekness, patience.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.680]   "Bear with one another.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.600]   "And if one has a complaint against another,
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.840]   "forgive each other.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.080]   "As the Lord has forgiven you, so you must also forgive.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.880]   "And above all else, and above all these, put on love,
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.320]   "which binds everything together in perfect harmony,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.480]   "and let the peace of Christ rule in your heart
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.640]   "to which you indeed were called in one body,
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.760]   "and be thankful."
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.600]   You have good reason to be.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.280]   Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly,
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.400]   teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.520]   singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.280]   with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.840]   And whatever you do, in word or in deed,
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.740]   do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.440]   giving thanks to God the Father through him.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.280]   It says in verse 12 that we put on
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.800]   five different virtues of love.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.160]   He gave us 10 vices that we are to put off,
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.260]   and now he gives us five virtues that we're to put on.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.540]   The Greek for put on is literally descriptive of clothing.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.720]   You take off the old and you put on the new.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.440]   You've outgrown that way of life,
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.660]   now it's time to put on the new way of life.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.540]   What's it look like?
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.320]   It looks like Jesus, that's what it looks like.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.080]   You're supposed to look like he looks.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   What does he look like?
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.960]   In one word, as this text tells us in verse 14,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.400]   it looks like love.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.500]   That's what it looks like,
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.760]   because he lived a life clothed with love for other people.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.780]   And so we should do the exact same thing.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.320]   When Brooke and I first started dating,
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.680]   I wore a lot of flannel.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.160]   In contrast, Brooke did not.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.460]   She did not wear any flannel.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.240]   She had no flannel whatsoever.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.160]   And because I loved her,
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.140]   what I decided is I was going to buy her
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.160]   her very first flannel.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.200]   So I decided to make the purchase,
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.240]   which guys, you can commiserate with me
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.580]   in the fact that buying clothes for your girl
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.080]   is really difficult to do.
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.520]   But I made the purchase,
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.840]   the bigger the flannel, the better, you know?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.320]   And so it was an easy purchase.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.480]   Went, bought the flannel, gave it to Brooke.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.500]   And what do you think happened when she got it?
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.000]   Think she just like shoved it in the closet?
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.360]   Like refused to let it ever see the light of day?
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.800]   No.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.640]   She wore it the very next date that we went on.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.880]   Why?
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.840]   I know.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.880]   Why did she do it?
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.880]   Is it because she loved the flannel?
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.520]   No.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.960]   I haven't seen it since.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.940]   She wore it because she loved me.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:23.920]   She wanted to look like the one who loved her.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.120]   And in the same way,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.720]   we should desire to look like the one who loves us.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.520]   Jesus Christ has loved us with a love
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.640]   that is genuinely inexpressible.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.400]   We do our best here every Tuesday to tell you about it.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.360]   But the best manner with which you can see his love
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.060]   is by looking at our lives.
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.440]   I pray the same would be true for you.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.560]   You see, Paul, to help us get an idea
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.760]   of what this love looks like,
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.040]   he gives us three verbs over the course
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.640]   of this section of scripture.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.320]   And those verbs are to bear with one another,
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.760]   forgive one another, and admonish one another.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.200]   All of which are extremely inconveniencing, right?
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.280]   They're all inconveniencing.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.680]   Like just think about it.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.320]   No one chooses to bear with someone else because it's easy.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.840]   No, bearing with someone,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.800]   that's a conscious choice to enter into suffering
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.160]   alongside someone you care about.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:23.080]   Like no one chooses to forgive someone because it's easy.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.440]   No, it's a conscious choice to overlook the wrong
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.420]   and trespass of someone that has done you dirty.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:34.000]   No one chooses to admonish people because it's easy.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.880]   But instead it's a conscious choice to brave the awkward
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:42.640]   and confront someone because you actually do care about them
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   and you wanna see them better.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.800]   This is what it looks like to love.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.780]   You see, Paul, and our final point tells us,
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.920]   if you wanna look like Christ,
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.500]   then this is the kind of love you should have.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.960]   And yet what you need to know is,
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.780]   although love is rarely easy, it's always worth it.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.700]   Although love is rarely easy, it's often inconveniencing.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.640]   It's always worth it.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.240]   Paul begins a section by reminding us
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.160]   that we're God's chosen ones, holy, beloved,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.240]   which is interesting because those three words,
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.680]   adjectives that he uses there, chosen, holy, beloved,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.460]   those are all very descriptive of Jesus Christ himself.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.140]   As you read about Jesus's life in the scriptures.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.340]   Why is that interesting?
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.800]   Because if you read about us in the scriptures,
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.720]   we were not always identified as holy, chosen, and beloved.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.480]   Instead, we were identified as the enemies of God.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.840]   And yet here's what's wild.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.080]   He has made you like his son
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.160]   because despite the fact that you're his enemy,
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.120]   he loved you anyways.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.920]   That's what he says in Romans 5, 8.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.000]   But God shows his love for us
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.680]   in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   You see, God, he did the undeniable.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.600]   He did something the likes of which
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.640]   we will spend the rest of our lives
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.680]   and all eternity trying to understand.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   He chose to love us when we were so very unlovable.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   I officiate weddings a lot.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.880]   That's part of the gig.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   This is kind of what you do.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.980]   You're a bunch of young singles,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.120]   maybe some marrieds in the room, mostly young singles.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.040]   And so I get the joy of watching two people find each other
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.680]   and wrap their arms up and make their way into the future.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.600]   And so I stand at the altar with people.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.320]   And what I hear every time I see two people
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.840]   come to the altar and they covenant together in marriage
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.800]   is I hear them make vows.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.720]   They look at each other and they say things like,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.480]   "For better or worse, for richer or poorer,
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.020]   sickness and in health, when you look like this
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.080]   and when you don't, I'm in."
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   Doesn't matter.
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.680]   Here at the beginning of our marriage,
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.220]   before we've ever seen a day out in front of us,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.400]   before we know any of the troubles or the trials that await,
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.800]   whether it's bright in the future or it's extremely bleak,
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   right now, here in this moment, at this altar, I choose you.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.940]   I want you.
[00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.400]   It doesn't matter what you do.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.200]   I'm in, I choose you regardless
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   of what you will or will not do to me, for me, or with me.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   That's a love that is so uncharacteristic of our world.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.560]   You see, our world, we look at love
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.600]   and what it does is the world would say,
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.840]   "Love is all about compatibility."
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.660]   You know?
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.160]   Hey man, like so long as this is working for you
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.960]   and it's working for me and we're moving on
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.460]   and gaining ground, I'm in.
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.480]   But the minute you let me down,
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.360]   the minute this thing doesn't work out, I'm out.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.880]   The good news of the way in which Jesus has loved us
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.520]   is he has not chosen to love us because we're compatible.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.480]   There's no more incompatible couple in all of history
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.140]   than Christ and his church.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:13.160]   No, he loves us because he chooses to,
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.480]   because he's committed to us.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.720]   Love is rarely easy.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:25.320]   And so is it equally difficult to love an enemy.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.880]   And yet he wanted you, he wanted me.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.560]   So he chose us in a difficult moment,
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.720]   in a moment that stretched his arms out
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.900]   upon Calvary's cross, because it was worth it to him.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.440]   And so we should love each other like this.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.440]   This is characteristic for those that live in Christ.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.680]   They choose to love one another.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.480]   How do I know that?
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.600]   Because it's characteristic of Christ himself.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.000]   He has chosen to love us.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   You see, before we ever thought to set our minds
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   on things above, Christ Jesus set his mind on us here below.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.080]   And he made his way close to us.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.600]   Before you and I could ever take off our shame,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   Christ took off his glory by hanging himself up
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.840]   for all to see, bearing the full consequence
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.780]   of what we in our sinfulness rightly deserved.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:46.740]   And before we could ever put on his righteousness,
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:50.880]   he voluntarily put on our sin.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.140]   (gentle music)
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.840]   What are you setting your mind on?
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.680]   Whatever it is, it does not compare to him.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:09.020]   What clothes or garments, old way of life
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.120]   are you still wearing tonight that he's looking at you
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.280]   and he's saying, "Lay it down, take it off."
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:20.000]   What would love look like in your life to put it on?
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.640]   This is the call before us here tonight, porch,
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   because this is the call to all that would claim Christ.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   Let me pray for us.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.060]   (gentle music)
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.900]   (water trickling)
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.480]   (gentle music)
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.320]   (water trickling)
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.940]   Father, when I think about your son
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:25.880]   and all God that he would give to get us,
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.620]   I cannot think of anything, God,
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:35.180]   that I would not give to get him in return.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.260]   It is so mind-blowing, wild to consider
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:51.140]   that you, God, a God that is real,
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:56.140]   a God that is alive, a God that is incomprehensible,
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:05.660]   a greater God than we could dare to dream,
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:10.660]   that a God like that would look upon a people like us,
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.860]   like us, riddled in our sin, covered in our shame,
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:21.580]   walking around with a stain the likes
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.980]   of which we can never clean,
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.980]   and you, God, would say, "I want you."
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.820]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.540]   I don't understand it, God.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.980]   And yet that is what you have declared
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.100]   across the corridors of time in your son,
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.020]   is you have seen us when we were a long way off,
[00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.300]   lost in our sin, and you said, "I'm coming for you.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.940]   I'll chase you down.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.460]   I'll move heaven and earth
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.220]   and across whatever barrier there is just to get to you."
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:45:00.500]   What God would we not give up to get that?
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.380]   What God would we not lay down to have that?
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.820]   (gentle music)
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.540]   And God, I know like here tonight,
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:12.060]   there are people in this room that you're looking upon
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.420]   with a full knowledge, God, of their sin.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.100]   And your response isn't anger.
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.260]   It's not disappointment.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.820]   It's not frustration.
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:27.500]   It's, "Little girl, my precious boy,
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.260]   what are you doing here?
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.620]   How did you arrive at this place?
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:39.340]   This deserves to be dealt with,
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.020]   and I will deal with it.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:46.820]   But you come with me,
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.060]   and we will see the end of it together."
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.660]   Friends, some of you here tonight,
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.220]   we sing this at the beginning of the evening.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.380]   This is a moment of surrender.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.460]   This is a fresh start.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:08.420]   It's a chance to break the script of your regular life
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.860]   and say, "God, I don't wanna go this way anymore.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.180]   I don't wanna set my mind on the things of this world.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.420]   I wanna set it on you.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.820]   I don't wanna entertain these sins, God,
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.340]   which you went to the cross to condemn.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.860]   Instead, I wanna trust in you."
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.260]   Others of us, we're here,
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.460]   and we're not ready to be forgiven.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.380]   And man, we've set our mind on the meaningful,
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:34.860]   and we're actively putting to death
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:35.980]   these things in our life
[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.980]   which are not characteristic of Christ.
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.900]   Who then is it that God is calling you,
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.620]   compelling you to love,
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:48.660]   to admonish, to forgive, to bear with alongside?
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.740]   What does that look like in your life?
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.820]   God is working here in this space.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.900]   He has brought you here this evening
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:01.460]   individually for you to take a step with.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.780]   What's that step look like?
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.260]   God, we trust you,
[00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.940]   and we step towards you that we might go further,
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:15.300]   we might ascend higher,
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.420]   we might delve deeper than we've ever gone on our own.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.620]   It's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:30.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
