1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,540
 - Well, all right, welcome friends in the room,

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,920
 friends in Fort Worth and in Houston and El Paso

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,500
 and Austin and Corsicana, Tulsa, wherever,

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,920
 and this guy back here in the front row.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,500
 Hey, really quick announcement before we jump

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,660
 into what we're gonna do tonight.

8
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,400
 We wanted to make sure everybody's joining us.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,480
 This is the last kind of corporate gathering

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,080
 we're gonna have in 2018, say it ain't so,

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,080
 but because of that, we wanted to make sure

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,000
 that we gave one more just opportunity for you guys

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
 to find out about this thing we're doing called Awaken,

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
 which is a conference over Memorial Day weekend

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,520
 where thousands of young adults are gonna come together

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,800
 and gather and we hope it is a launching pad

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,160
 for what God is gonna start in our nation,

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,740
 a revival of sorts.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,740
 We believe that this generation is the group

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,680
 that God is gonna use to do something transformative

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,200
 to the society that we live in

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,980
 and we believe that when we lock arms

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,240
 underneath the name of Christ, we can be a part of it

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,600
 and candidly, we wanna see what God is doing here

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,960
 in spite of us really take place all over the country

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,160
 and all over our world for his name

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,640
 and for people to not come to the porch,

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,880
 but people to come to Jesus and come to meet him.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,360
 So because of that, I wanted to have my friend Garrett,

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,520
 who's gonna join us and let you guys know

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,440
 about an opportunity in light of the fact

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,080
 that we believe it's gonna sell out.

33
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,160
 We want everyone who God wants to be there to be there

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,720
 and we know that the people inside of this room

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,120
 are connected to and are some of the people

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,920
 that we wanna partner with and gather with

37
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
 and he wants to let you guys know,

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,440
 we want you guys to know about an opportunity

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,180
 before this year is out and so Garrett, take it from there.

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,120
 - Hey, if you wanna an idea of what the moment of Awaken

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,800
 is gonna be like, you can imagine three days,

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,920
 Memorial Day weekend, 2019, downtown Dallas,

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
 really close to some of you here in the room,

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,480
 might be a plane flight or a long road trip

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,000
 for some of you that are listening from elsewhere,

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,980
 but you can imagine Porch on Steroids, three days,

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,200
 some of the best communicators and leaders that you know

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,460
 and love, JP, Todd, David, the Shanes,

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,400
 and the best lineup we have ever put together

50
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,320
 that we are not going to announce just yet.

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,400
 I'm sorry about that, we're holding you in suspense,

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
 but it is gonna be what we believe

53
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,120
 is gonna be the most definitive moment in Porch history.

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,100
 I don't know if you know the narrative of the Porch,

55
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,640
 but it began over a decade ago with dozens of people

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,040
 and now you look around or you listen in

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,020
 and you pay attention and you can kinda notice

58
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,960
 what God has done here, which by the way,

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,000
 is nothing but an extension of the church

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,840
 Jesus created 2,000 years ago.

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
 We get to play one little small part

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,640
 and Awakened Conference is us opening our arms wide

63
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,160
 to get more people together.

64
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,640
 We used to do a three day holiday weekend retreat

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,920
 and we shut that one down because there wasn't enough room,

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,080
 not only for the people elsewhere,

67
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,200
 but even for right here in Dallas.

68
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,440
 So that's what's gonna happen

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
 and you just gotta know one thing,

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,160
 for us it's not just about the moment,

71
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
 it's about the movement.

72
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,260
 It's not just about coming together as a big church

73
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,760
 for a big meeting, this is about a big cause

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,520
 that a big God is inviting us into his purpose for our lives.

75
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,060
 The greatest cause, the greatest claim

76
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,760
 that anyone would ever have on our lives

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
 is the purpose and the fame of Jesus Christ.

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
 So I'm sorry, I'm not gonna preach this,

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
 it's your turn tonight.

80
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,180
 But so here's what you can do

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,480
 between now and the end of the year,

82
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,300
 here's what we're gonna do,

83
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,760
 we've had people ask a little bit about gear,

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,480
 if you want some free gear, here's all you gotta do.

85
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,320
 When you sign up any time between now

86
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
 and the end of the year, as soon as you complete

87
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,760
 your ticket purchase, you're gonna get a unique link.

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,280
 It's gonna be a pop-up and a follow-up email.

89
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,880
 This is not that pop-up you X out of,

90
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,400
 this is the one you wanna click on.

91
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,760
 You get your link, you share that with friends,

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,420
 and if just one friend signs up through your link,

93
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,000
 then we are gonna mail you this swag box

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,120
 in the mail, T-shirt, the one David is rocking right here,

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,240
 and some of these other guys are gonna be wearing,

96
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
 we're gonna mail that to you, that's how you get it.

97
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
 - Not this one, not this exact one.

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,560
 - Not that exact one, yeah.

99
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,520
 You're wearing it well, though.

100
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,360
 - Thank you. - I'm sure some people

101
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,400
 would want that.

102
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,840
 But anyway, not I.

103
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,240
 So here's the deal.

104
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,600
 Don't make me tell these people you modeled,

105
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,200
 I felt too late, too late.

106
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
 - Hey, we gotta land this plane.

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,240
 - So here's the deal, between now and the end of the year,

108
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,320
 you'll get the link, that's how you do it.

109
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,260
 Couple things, if you've already signed up,

110
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
 don't worry, we emailed you so you can get in on this,

111
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,760
 so there's an email waiting for you there.

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,560
 So Merry Christmas from AwakendConference.

113
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,400
 We'll see you guys in May.

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,220
 - I love it.

115
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,920
 Hey, well tonight we're gonna have a fun chance

116
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,560
 to talk about how to survive the holidays.

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,080
 We're coming fresh off Thanksgiving break.

118
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,560
 We're headed in towards Christmas,

119
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,460
 and how to avoid some of the pitfalls

120
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,840
 of just the Christmas break,

121
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,720
 and make sure that your faith doesn't take a holiday

122
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,560
 over the holidays.

123
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,380
 And so that's where we're gonna dive in

124
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,840
 for the next 30, 35 minutes or so.

125
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,640
 And look who it is.

126
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,440
 You guys, give it up for Jonathan McKernan.

127
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,600
 (audience cheering)

128
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
 - How we doing, porch?

129
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,360
 (audience cheering)

130
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,400
 Hey, I'm just gonna follow that up and say,

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
 listen, you don't wanna miss that.

132
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,960
 I've sat on this stage dozens of times,

133
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
 and I've talked to people, and I've said,

134
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,720
 hey, you don't wanna miss this,

135
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,360
 you don't wanna miss this, you don't wanna miss this.

136
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
 Then they come crying to me and say,

137
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,680
 hey, I'm sorry that I didn't listen to you.

138
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,720
 Awaken.live.

139
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,100
 It's gonna be the things that people are talking about

140
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,400
 for generations to come, all right?

141
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,400
 Hey, I'm pumped to start these little messages this evening.

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
 There's gonna be three of 'em,

143
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,100
 but this first one is sometimes,

144
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,760
 we have all of these expectations around Christmas,

145
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,440
 and things don't quite go as planned.

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,480
 And so this happened to me last year, all right?

147
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,800
 I'm a dad, I've got three kids,

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,520
 and I was wrestling with what to get them for Christmas.

149
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,180
 And I said I was gonna go big.

150
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,960
 I saw the Lexus commercials, the Hallmark commercials,

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,280
 and not the Lexus, but the puppy in the commercials.

152
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,760
 And I thought, I'm gonna get them a puppy.

153
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,720
 Now, this was a big deal, because my wife and I,

154
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 we have argued about this topic of pets for 14 years, okay?

155
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 Because we just disagree, we view them differently, right?

156
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,860
 Like, I view them as pets, and she views them as people.

157
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,320
 And so we just, we don't see eye to eye on that.

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,640
 But you know what, I said, I'm gonna do it.

159
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,760
 My little girl wants a puppy.

160
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,160
 Well, like, I'm just gonna make it happen.

161
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
 And I had this huge plan of the grand reveal

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,480
 being here at Watermark at the Christmas party.

163
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,720
 And we went and we picked out this

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,840
 fluffy little Labradoodle thing,

165
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,680
 and got the box, and it had the big bow on it

166
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,000
 and everything, and we kept the puppy in here

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 for just the right moment at the Christmas party

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
 with kids out there.

169
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,480
 It was gonna be the grand unveil.

170
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,560
 And I had friends with video cameras and taking pictures,

171
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,200
 because it was gonna go mega viral on Instagram.

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
 And so I actually, I'm gonna show you the video, all right?

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
 I want you, here's the video.

174
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,200
 (crowd chattering)

175
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,160
 All right, we got two, all right,

176
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,920
 hold on, let's pause the game really quick.

177
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
 - Presents!

178
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,720
 - We gotta get the order in.

179
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,280
 You ready? - Yeah.

180
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
 - Ready to open it?

181
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,720
 Okay.

182
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,080
 I didn't stop it right there.

183
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,360
 Here's what happened.

184
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,440
 The person who was filming stopped filming

185
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,320
 because when they opened the box

186
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,920
 and they saw what was inside, they completely panicked,

187
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,840
 as did everyone else.

188
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
 Somehow, from moving that puppy from there

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,000
 to the fireplace in that box,

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 it managed to get the bow completely wrapped around its neck

191
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,200
 so tight that when they opened the box,

192
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,760
 it was strangling the puppy nearly to death, okay?

193
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,320
 And so we started Christmas with an almost dead puppy,

194
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,960
 all right?

195
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,040
 And so there were lots of tears that followed that moment,

196
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
 lots of trauma, I've got two children

197
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,680
 in counseling because of it, okay?

198
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,340
 This did not go as planned.

199
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,080
 And in the same way that that bow,

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,040
 in the same way that that bow nearly choked out that puppy,

201
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,720
 your expectations around the holidays

202
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
 may choke out Christmas.

203
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,240
 And so I wanna talk about that for just a moment.

204
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
 Three things that will bound you up over the holidays.

205
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,240
 And you can think about what these are, right?

206
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
 Some of you expect or hope to be snuggled up

207
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,880
 with someone near a fire,

208
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,840
 but you found yourself in a season of loneliness,

209
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,360
 or some of you are hoping for a particular gift,

210
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,280
 but all of your friends and your family

211
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
 aren't getting the hints

212
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,920
 that you're not so subtly dropping.

213
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,180
 Some of you are thinking about running into your ex

214
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,320
 in Walmart and reminding them how successful you are

215
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,620
 or that you're a pastor or that you've written a book.

216
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,460
 No, nevermind.

217
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,520
 [congregation laughing]

218
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,560
 You know that your mom and dad this holiday,

219
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,400
 when you go home,

220
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,480
 you know they're gonna be boozing it up, right?

221
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,600
 And you're thinking about that already,

222
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,520
 how you're gonna navigate that,

223
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,780
 or you know you're gonna run into your old friends

224
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,200
 and they're gonna get throwed on New Year's.

225
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,360
 And you're already thinking about that.

226
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,260
 Those are where your expectations are going.

227
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,700
 And so let's talk about three things,

228
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,040
 three expectations that will have you bound this holiday.

229
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,900
 The first one is busyness.

230
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,720
 Number one, busyness.

231
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,080
 We expect to be busy 'tis the season,

232
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,520
 to panic and stress and travel

233
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,600
 and the parties and the Christmas parties,

234
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,960
 the New Year's parties, the families in town,

235
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,480
 and you're trying to balance it all

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,960
 or the stress of thinking about being alone,

237
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,840
 not missing out, wanting to be everywhere at once

238
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,880
 and staying by yourself is just a traumatic thought.

239
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,700
 And I would say, what if you adjusted your expectations

240
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,700
 that right now you are going to find some quiet space

241
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,520
 this holiday, this Christmas,

242
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
 that you actually were gonna plan on it,

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,080
 that when it happens you don't have to panic,

244
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,660
 but you've planned for it

245
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,800
 because you believe this could honor God.

246
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,720
 See, busy, I've heard, is an acronym,

247
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 being under Satan's yoke, being under Satan's yoke.

248
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
 Yoke is a strange word.

249
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,520
 Yoke is something that you put around an animal

250
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,240
 so that you have an ability to control it.

251
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,740
 It's something you bound an animal with.

252
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,040
 But let me read to you what Jesus says

253
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
 in Matthew 11, verses 28 and 30.

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,

255
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,240
 and I will give you rest, for my yoke is easy

256
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,300
 and my burden is light.

257
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,520
 Another thing that's gonna have you bound this holiday

258
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,740
 are your old friends.

259
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,080
 You're gonna go back to some of the same places

260
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,760
 and the same spaces that you've been to

261
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,220
 and you're gonna bump into some of the same people.

262
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,560
 And what I know is true of everyone listening

263
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,920
 here in Dallas and wherever you're at through the stream

264
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,120
 is that everyone here has a past.

265
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,960
 And when you go home for the holidays,

266
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,920
 a lot of times that past is waiting on you.

267
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,280
 And you drive by those familiar places

268
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,600
 and you know, like, I got in a fight right there

269
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
 and oh, I remember we got high right there

270
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,480
 and that one time we stole those bottles of wine

271
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
 from that store and then went over there

272
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,640
 and got drunk, I actually got arrested over there.

273
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
 And when you're driving through those familiar places,

274
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
 we made out behind that, right,

275
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,220
 those memories are gonna be flooding back at you, right?

276
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,520
 You know where the porn stash is.

277
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,380
 You know where the sin is waiting for you.

278
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,960
 And those old friends, they wanna pick right back up

279
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
 where you left off.

280
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,120
 You know those old friends,

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,520
 they're telling the same stories over and over.

282
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,400
 Remember when we, and it's followed by a lot of laughter,

283
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,080
 you're laughing, you know what you're doing, you're laughing.

284
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,360
 It's all like, oh yeah, I remember, we can't believe.

285
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,000
 And all the while you're laughing

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 at the very things that Christ died for.

287
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,080
 Reliving those stories that have caused scars

288
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,960
 that you still have today.

289
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,480
 And I will just tell you that if you cannot influence

290
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,800
 those friends for Christ,

291
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,400
 then they will influence you for Satan.

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,480
 I know that feels heavy handed,

293
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,720
 and I'm gonna say it again.

294
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,360
 If you don't influence them for Christ,

295
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,160
 they're going to influence you for Satan.

296
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,600
 And so you need to think about what it looks like

297
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,620
 to be intentional with those friends

298
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,860
 or to not have any contact with them at all,

299
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,080
 which may be exactly what you need to do.

300
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,600
 And so what you can expect is expect to tell them

301
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,900
 how you've changed, that it's no longer you who live,

302
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,880
 but Christ that lives in you.

303
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,200
 There's a story about St. Augustine

304
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,800
 that when he had this radical conversion,

305
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,560
 he lived in the world and Jesus grabbed ahold of his heart.

306
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
 And one day when he was walking

307
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,400
 and he bumped into an old mistress of his.

308
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,680
 And when he saw her, he began to walk quickly

309
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,800
 the other direction, but she tried to stop him.

310
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,680
 Augustine, Augustine, it is I.

311
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,100
 Augustine, it is I.

312
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,140
 And he stopped and he turned back to her

313
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,160
 and he said, yes, madam, but it is no longer I.

314
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,080
 And he kept going.

315
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,480
 And some of you, that's the message

316
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,520
 that you need to give your friends.

317
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,500
 Hey, I've changed.

318
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,600
 I'm not the same old person.

319
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,480
 I don't delight in those stories anymore.

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,400
 I remember them, but they're no longer,

321
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,920
 that's no longer how I have fun,

322
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,440
 that's no longer what I do.

323
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
 I'm a new creation.

324
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,280
 The third thing that will have you bound this holiday

325
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,220
 is wine.

326
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,920
 Wine is what it's called in the Scriptures, alcohol, right?

327
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,560
 We expect to party this holiday.

328
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,500
 We expect to party at New Year's,

329
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,080
 but Ephesians 5:18 says, do not get drunk on wine,

330
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,060
 which leads to debauchery, amen.

331
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,680
 We all know that.

332
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,880
 It leads to debauchery when you get drunk on wine.

333
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,000
 It leads to, it only leads to one,

334
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
 the Scripture doesn't give you a lot of options.

335
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,040
 There's wine, you get drunk, it leads to debauchery.

336
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,300
 That's what it does.

337
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,160
 Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit.

338
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 You also have instruction in Proverbs 20,

339
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,240
 in chapter 23, in chapter 31.

340
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
 Over and over, the Scriptures warn us about this.

341
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,000
 And for so many Christians,

342
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,080
 Christmas and New Year's means party.

343
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,060
 It's almost like the purge or Fat Tuesday.

344
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,880
 It's like that season where, you know,

345
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,560
 we know we're not supposed to,

346
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,740
 but we're just gonna do it anyway.

347
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,740
 We're just gonna give our flesh permission to indulge.

348
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,480
 And it's crazy because it's like the thing,

349
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,080
 when it's the time when Jesus came to the earth

350
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,760
 and the way that we celebrate the birth of our Savior

351
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,300
 is by getting wasted.

352
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,340
 And some of you, you're walking into extreme temptation

353
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,780
 and you know it.

354
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,120
 And I want you to know because I just want this

355
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,760
 to be really clear,

356
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,200
 so that you don't have to wrestle with it.

357
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,940
 For the rest of your life, from this moment forward,

358
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,320
 for the rest of your life, until you are with Jesus,

359
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,300
 you getting drunk will be a sin.

360
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,380
 You don't have to wonder.

361
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,420
 Like you getting drunk, it's a sin.

362
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,340
 Let's just call it what it is.

363
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,380
 It's a sin.

364
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,900
 It grieves the heart of God.

365
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,340
 And so I'm not a pastor that's like,

366
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,780
 hey, you can't drink any alcohol, that that's wrong.

367
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,860
 You having a glass of wine, it may not be a sin for you.

368
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,780
 You having two glasses of wine, it may be a sin for you.

369
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,980
 You having a beer, it may not be a sin for you.

370
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,420
 If that's not your struggle,

371
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,940
 you're not tempted to have two or three or four,

372
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,860
 but you having two or three or four,

373
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,820
 let's call it what it is.

374
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,180
 Let's just look at that and say, oh yeah, that's a sin.

375
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,980
 I just willfully chose to go the opposite way

376
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,300
 of what the scripture said.

377
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,160
 That's what I did.

378
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,580
 Let's call it what it is.

379
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,060
 And it's always going to bring bondage.

380
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,220
 No good story in your life starts,

381
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,860
 remember when we got so drunk?

382
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,640
 Whatever comes next is not gonna,

383
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,860
 remember when we got so drunk

384
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,540
 and we experienced that deep intimacy with Jesus?

385
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,740
 No, it's never gonna be that.

386
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,580
 Remember when we got wasted

387
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,980
 and we grew so much spiritually?

388
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,820
 No, no, no.

389
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,900
 Remember when we were so wasted

390
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,580
 that we gave all our money to the orphans?

391
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,220
 No, that's not the way that that works out.

392
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,740
 Maybe to the bartender, but not the orphans, right?

393
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,000
 And so this Christmas, expect to stay sober.

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
 I know that literally some of you

395
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,420
 have literally been enslaved by this.

396
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,120
 Like several of you, dozens of you have been through rehab.

397
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,420
 All while the enemy just delights

398
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,860
 in the way that we celebrate Christmas.

399
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,140
 And so things that will entangle you over this holiday

400
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,860
 is things that will have you tied up.

401
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,860
 Busyness, old friends, and wine.

402
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,900
 It spells bow, like the very one that strangled my puppy.

403
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,720
 All right.

404
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
 Hebrews 12, one and two says this.

405
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,960
 Let us throw off everything that hinders

406
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,400
 and the sin that so easily entangles

407
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
 and let us run with perseverance

408
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
 the race marked out for us,

409
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,400
 fixing our eyes on Jesus,

410
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.

411
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,640
 Let us throw off everything that entangles us

412
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,120
 and the sin that hinders us

413
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,160
 and let us fix our eyes on the one

414
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,240
 who came to the earth to save us.

415
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,760
 What's interesting about the word bow

416
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,640
 is it's a homograph.

417
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,660
 It is a word that can be pronounced two different ways

418
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,640
 with two very different meanings.

419
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,280
 It's also how you spell bow.

420
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,800
 And bow is what you want to do this holiday, this Christmas.

421
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,940
 Bow is what you want to do with your life.

422
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,440
 If you want to avoid the sin that so easily entangles you,

423
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,480
 you maintain a posturing of the very ones

424
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,480
 who first walked up upon the baby in a manger

425
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,000
 that their knees broke, their back bent,

426
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,040
 their face to the ground, and they worshiped him.

427
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,400
 You live a life of worship.

428
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,080
 Do not conform any longer to the patterns of this world,

429
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,740
 but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

430
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,180
 Then you will be able to test and approve

431
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,980
 what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will.

432
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,260
 He says, therefore, I urge you in view of God's mercy

433
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,260
 to present your bodies as living sacrifices.

434
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,140
 So you bow before the Savior.

435
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,780
 I know for some of you, you hear that

436
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,340
 and you feel like it's too late.

437
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,820
 And you're like, what do I do if it's too late?

438
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,320
 That's why my friend Daniel Crawford

439
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,880
 is gonna come up and share with you

440
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,760
 exactly what you need to do if it's too late.

441
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,860
 And so please welcome Daniel to the stage.

442
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,280
 [audience applauding]

443
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
 - Lower this down a little bit.

444
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,980
 I remember it clearly.

445
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,920
 I was driving home.

446
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,120
 It was a holiday break.

447
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,040
 I was cruising down I-45, going to Houston,

448
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,840
 and I heard that sound.

449
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,520
 And if you know that sound,

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,240
 I realized, darn it, something has gone wrong

451
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,160
 with my automobile.

452
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
 I must check, I must pull over.

453
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,320
 And I looked, and sure enough, I had blown a tire,

454
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,480
 and I had a flat tire.

455
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,680
 And so in the grand scheme of malfunctions,

456
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,360
 not the biggest deal in the world.

457
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,460
 I can overcome this so long as I know

458
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,480
 how to properly change a tire.

459
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,760
 I don't know how to properly change a tire.

460
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,540
 And so I was by myself.

461
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,600
 And so frankly, I was kind of out of luck,

462
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,560
 and I was kind of figuring out what do I do next.

463
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,760
 I was feeling rather deflated, literally and metaphorically.

464
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,480
 And so I start with that for exactly what JP just said,

465
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,600
 which is, man, I'm just rolling off of Thanksgiving,

466
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,760
 which kind of kickstarts the holiday season,

467
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,400
 and I'm not feeling like I'm firing on all cylinders.

468
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,440
 Like if that's any indicator

469
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,400
 of what I'm gonna be looking at in December,

470
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,760
 I'm not encouraged.

471
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,600
 I'm discouraged.

472
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,320
 And so this second little mini message

473
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,500
 is gonna be about what do I do when I've blown it?

474
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,880
 What do I do when I've blown it?

475
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,600
 So I admitted to you freely

476
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,340
 that I don't necessarily have a man card,

477
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,720
 at least not in that situation.

478
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
 I'm not handy.

479
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,280
 But I do have something that in that situation

480
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,000
 is of equal value.

481
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,880
 And so that's what I like to call a AAA card.

482
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,280
 Praise God, yes.

483
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
 And so I can call AAA when I don't know

484
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
 how to change my own tire,

485
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,640
 even though I'm a grown man, and they will come,

486
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,600
 and they will help me.

487
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,800
 And so I wanna give you guys three A's, that's right,

488
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 your very own AAA plan to call upon when you've blown it

489
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,400
 and when you're feeling flat.

490
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,040
 And so I'm actually gonna unpack very practically

491
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,120
 the exact passage that JP just closed with,

492
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,720
 which is in Hebrews 12.

493
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,360
 And so starting at the top in verse one,

494
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,200
 the first A is going to be accountability, accountability.

495
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
 And very simply, I would say, confess to community.

496
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,240
 When you've blown it, keep short accounts

497
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,360
 and confess to your community.

498
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,640
 That verse started by saying,

499
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,760
 "Therefore, since we are surrounded

500
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,200
 "by such a great cloud of witnesses,"

501
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,520
 that's what it's talking about.

502
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,960
 Who are, it assumes that there is a great cloud of witnesses

503
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,400
 that there are people surrounding you to love you,

504
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 to support you, to point you back to the truth

505
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,800
 that's found in God's words

506
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,400
 so that ultimately they can point you back to Jesus.

507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,560
 I would also say that I would encourage you guys

508
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,480
 to get to a point where you're confessing

509
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,360
 even at a thought level,

510
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,000
 even in the moments of temptation

511
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 where maybe you haven't blown it, I would get on the phone,

512
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,760
 I would loop in your crew, your guys, your girls,

513
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,720
 "Hey, this is what I'm struggling with.

514
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,840
 "I'm feeling very tempted right now, will you pray for me?"

515
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,640
 James 5:16 says, "Confess your sins to one another

516
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,940
 "and pray for one another so that you may be healed."

517
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,120
 And if you're like me, when I'm feeling in those moments,

518
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,520
 when I've blown it, I want healing.

519
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,400
 And so that starts with confession,

520
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,560
 it starts with prayer, it starts with community,

521
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,640
 it starts with accountability.

522
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,240
 And so that verse continued, verse one,

523
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,160
 "Surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,

524
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,280
 "let us throw off everything that hinders

525
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,440
 "and the sin that so easily entangles."

526
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
 So JP hit that hard.

527
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,520
 What are the things that we need to avoid,

528
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,560
 that we need to remove access from?

529
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,200
 The second A is access.

530
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,120
 "Repent and remove access for whatever those things are

531
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,820
 "that are hindering you, that are causing you to blow it

532
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,640
 "and to feel deflated."

533
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
 And so he talked about alcohol.

534
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 I would include drugs in there.

535
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,080
 Yes, I would consider weed a drug.

536
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,960
 Okay, and so the question comes along,

537
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,000
 can I not go anywhere where there's alcohol?

538
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,840
 And I would just say, maybe.

539
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,760
 I would say you would probably know better than me.

540
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,620
 I would say I wouldn't rule it out.

541
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,000
 And I would also say that personally,

542
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,680
 if I'm like on a diet,

543
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,120
 like I'm trying to keep my boyish figure here,

544
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,160
 and I'm throwing some, I'm going keto on you.

545
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,480
 I don't even fully know what that is yet,

546
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,400
 but I've heard it's a thing.

547
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,680
 If I hypothetically wanted to go keto, which I don't,

548
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,520
 I'm probably not gonna go hang out at Cain's

549
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,720
 and watch people eat fried chicken all day

550
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,560
 'cause it's delicious.

551
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,120
 And I've been there so many times.

552
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,000
 And as soon as I see the sauce, I start salivating.

553
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,160
 I don't wanna talk about it even right now.

554
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,880
 And so I would rather just avoid the temptation.

555
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,960
 I would just dodge.

556
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,280
 I would endure the night with a little bit of FOMO

557
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,160
 instead of the morning with a whole lot of uh-oh,

558
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,520
 if you know what I'm talking about.

559
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,900
 And there is that strong correlation

560
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,800
 between when I'm under the influence,

561
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,760
 I'm gonna do things that I'm gonna regret.

562
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,800
 I'm going to make mistakes.

563
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,680
 And so JP also talked about old friends,

564
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,180
 and I might just add old flames.

565
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,520
 You know what I'm talking about, okay?

566
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,100
 Being mindful, not just of the party atmosphere,

567
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,820
 but also of the guest list.

568
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,320
 And I think he said that really well,

569
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,960
 which is, man, what is that balance

570
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,680
 between loving my friends and also just being wise?

571
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,020
 And I would say, I would encourage you

572
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,080
 to just set the tone with that

573
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,040
 and to stay in the driver's seat.

574
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,020
 I would literally drive wherever you're going

575
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,720
 so that you have that ability to control.

576
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,600
 I would also say, I think breakfast and lunch

577
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,640
 is your friend way more than dinner and drinks.

578
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,320
 And I would say, I think he hit on something that's huge,

579
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,500
 that is, if the main bond you share with these old friends

580
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,180
 is stories from the past,

581
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,800
 and it's a past that you're not particularly proud of

582
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,000
 and that you've been redeemed out of,

583
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,480
 you can take a walk down memory lane

584
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,500
 as you connect with people,

585
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,880
 but I would not stop and I would not celebrate sin.

586
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,120
 And I wouldn't relive that over and over again.

587
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,720
 I don't think that's helpful.

588
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,000
 So just a couple of facts.

589
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,720
 I am responsible for every bad decision that I make, period.

590
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,040
 And I seem to make a lot more bad decisions

591
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,200
 around certain people or certain groups of people.

592
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,560
 And so do without what you will.

593
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,240
 I would just be thoughtful before you commit to things,

594
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,960
 and I would be willing to say no.

595
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
 I'd be willing to say no.

596
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
 So there's dozens of other things

597
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,960
 you could remove access from.

598
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,960
 The one other one that I'll hit quickly is social media.

599
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,240
 And I would just say this,

600
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,760
 man, maybe you need to remove access entirely,

601
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,840
 or at least maybe you need to significantly reduce

602
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,480
 the amount of screen time.

603
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,640
 'Cause you know how it is.

604
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,340
 If I don't have a ton else to do,

605
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,400
 I can very easily get to scrolling, right?

606
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,240
 For countless periods of time, right?

607
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,080
 Do I find myself comparing or envying

608
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,080
 or judging other people's social media accounts?

609
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,680
 Am I kind of sort of monitoring whether a certain someone

610
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,600
 may or may not be here,

611
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,720
 may or may not be going there tonight?

612
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,560
 I don't know.

613
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,720
 Do you use social media to project things,

614
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,660
 especially over the holidays,

615
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,700
 that maybe if you're totally honest with yourself,

616
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,160
 masks some insecurities and communicates something

617
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,840
 that you know at best is an exaggeration

618
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
 and at worst is just blatantly untrue?

619
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,280
 Are you playing the game, the comparison trap?

620
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,840
 Are you getting caught in it?

621
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,280
 And ultimately, do my accounts,

622
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,160
 do they help or do they hinder my thought life?

623
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,920
 I would ask yourself that question.

624
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,600
 I would ask your community that question.

625
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,120
 And bottom line, as you throw off the sin

626
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,600
 that entangles you, just ask yourself,

627
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,360
 what are the things I need to remove access from?

628
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,880
 So lastly, and most importantly,

629
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,820
 the third A in our little triple A plan is to abide,

630
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,800
 to pursue and to protect your personal connection

631
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,120
 with Jesus Christ.

632
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
 It says, "Surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses,

633
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,460
 "throw off the sin that entangles

634
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,880
 "and then let us run with perseverance.

635
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,380
 "The race marks out for us,

636
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,600
 "fixing our eyes on Jesus,

637
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,540
 "the pioneer and the perfecter of our faith."

638
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,480
 Jesus said it like this.

639
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,840
 He said, "I am the vine, you are the branches,

640
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,700
 "whoever abides in me and I in him,

641
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,740
 "he it is who will bear much fruit.

642
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,680
 "For apart from me, you can do nothing.

643
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,720
 "Apart from me, you're going to blow it."

644
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,640
 That's what he's saying.

645
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,360
 And so what does abiding look like?

646
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,800
 You can get to a point where there's just a life

647
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,560
 of abiding with Christ on an ongoing basis.

648
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,760
 I would say, I would have a plan in place.

649
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,540
 I think structure can be helpful.

650
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,760
 And so a little strategy that I've picked up

651
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,820
 that I would pass along and commend to you

652
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,240
 is I would think through three things.

653
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,620
 I would have a time, I would have a place,

654
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,760
 and I would have a plan.

655
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,560
 A time, a place, and a plan.

656
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,240
 A time, any time, really, but what time of the day

657
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,120
 are you going to have the most control over

658
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,200
 and the most say over?

659
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,800
 Most of the time that's gonna be in the mornings.

660
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,200
 And so before I even leave my room,

661
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,420
 do I wanna set aside and devote some time

662
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,240
 to connecting with Jesus before I charge

663
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,000
 into all of the day's festivities or whatever?

664
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,960
 Okay, so time.

665
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,820
 I would be as specific as you can be,

666
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,400
 and I would also be realistic.

667
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,480
 And so it's the breaks, and maybe it's 9 a.m.

668
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,560
 instead of 7 a.m., I don't know.

669
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,920
 Be flexible, but have a plan and have a time.

670
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,000
 A place, where is the place where I can minimize

671
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,160
 distractions and therefore maximize devotion?

672
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,280
 And so that may not be in your bedroom

673
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,840
 if Uncle Eddie's riding top bunk right above you, right?

674
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,580
 You may need to go get some personal space.

675
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,580
 I would communicate, I would love your family

676
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,140
 won't communicate on that, but it's like,

677
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,780
 hey, I'm gonna be at Starbucks for an hour,

678
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,900
 and then I'm gonna be back, and I'm excited

679
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,560
 to spend the day with you guys digging in and catching up.

680
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,020
 And then finally, a plan.

681
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,220
 I would figure out now, or at least start to think about,

682
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,060
 what do you want to read through?

683
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,780
 What do you want to meditate on?

684
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,740
 What in God's word do you wanna work through

685
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,980
 over the break?

686
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,220
 Again, be specific as you can be,

687
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,520
 and also be realistic.

688
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,600
 For most of us, I think reading a chapter a day

689
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,220
 is very realistic.

690
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,040
 So I wouldn't just do Bible roulette

691
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,420
 and pick a verse and start reading, right?

692
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,800
 I would say, okay, there's 31 days in December,

693
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,860
 there's 31 Proverbs, what if I just read the Proverb

694
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,940
 that corresponded with whatever day that is

695
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,780
 and meditated on that?

696
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,680
 There's 24 chapters in Luke,

697
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,860
 there's 24 days leading up to Christmas.

698
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,820
 What if I walked through a gospel

699
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,060
 leading up to celebrating Christmas?

700
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,740
 January, we're not gonna be back in here till the 22nd,

701
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,060
 what if I read, what if I do January and John?

702
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,700
 21 chapters, days one through 21,

703
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,740
 and then we hit it hard in here on the 22nd.

704
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,140
 What if I did that?

705
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,420
 There's no wrong approach, but I would have a time,

706
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,540
 a place, and a plan.

707
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,820
 And the last thing I would say on this

708
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,420
 is this particularly can be hard

709
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,120
 when we're in the situation we're talking about,

710
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,720
 which is, man, I just blew it.

711
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,740
 Like, I am not proud of the decisions

712
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,700
 that I made last night.

713
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,740
 And frankly, I feel guilt, I feel shame,

714
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,420
 I don't feel like I can approach the creator

715
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,140
 of the heavens and the earth based on what I've just done.

716
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,000
 And I would just say, be free of that.

717
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,980
 I would say that Scripture is very clear

718
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,100
 that there is a difference

719
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,260
 between conviction and condemnation.

720
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,540
 Conviction is of the Spirit.

721
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,980
 If you are a believer and you have the Spirit of God,

722
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,420
 He's gonna convict you, that's a good thing.

723
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,700
 It's not fun, but it's a reminder,

724
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,820
 man, I can't just go back and indulge my flesh

725
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,260
 in the same ways I used to.

726
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,380
 So I'm gonna use that conviction to follow the Lord

727
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,100
 and to repent, as we've been saying.

728
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,700
 But condemnation, Romans 8, one just lays it out.

729
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,500
 It says, there is there now for no condemnation

730
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
 for those who are in Christ.

731
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,300
 If you're in Christ, if you are a believer

732
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,240
 and a follower of Christ, there is no condemnation.

733
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,140
 So you can pick your head up

734
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,780
 and you can pursue the one who has pursued you.

735
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,860
 And so grace to you, abide with Christ.

736
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,220
 Don't let your time off from work

737
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,460
 become time off from God's word.

738
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,140
 When you've blown it, pick yourself back up,

739
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,260
 fix your eyes on Jesus and keep running the race

740
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,100
 that He's marked out for you.

741
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,340
 And so in summary, our AAA plan,

742
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,860
 utilize accountability, remove access

743
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
 from the things that are harming you

744
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,080
 and abide with Christ every day.

745
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,260
 On the side of that road, I had to humbly admit

746
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,880
 that I was in an entirely helpless situation.

747
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,420
 I couldn't do anything to fix and to remedy the situation

748
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,660
 that I found myself in.

749
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,180
 And so when I blew it, I needed to call on somebody else.

750
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,860
 I needed somebody to come to me

751
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,660
 and to meet me in the midst of my mess.

752
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,460
 And guys, that is the Christmas story.

753
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,060
 That is exactly what we celebrate this time of years,

754
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,980
 the fact that we all have blown it.

755
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,220
 We all are helpless to fix and remedy our own situation.

756
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,220
 So God sent His very own Son to the earth.

757
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,740
 He put on flesh and He dwelt among us

758
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,780
 and His name is Jesus Christ.

759
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,180
 We get to celebrate His coming here in the next month.

760
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,620
 And so may we call upon Him whenever we've blown it

761
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,860
 in this season and in every season.

762
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,380
 And so to close out the night,

763
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,720
 y'all help me give a warm welcome to my buddy, David Marvin.

764
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,940
 (congregation applauding)

765
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,820
 - All right, hey, anyone dating in this room?

766
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,420
 Show of hands.

767
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,940
 Good, there's three of you.

768
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,160
 Hopefully you know.

769
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,940
 And let's do another meet and greet

770
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,180
 to give you guys a chance to meet each other.

771
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,140
 Good grief, people.

772
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,060
 Guys, ask some of these girls out.

773
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,940
 Hey, when I was dating, 10 years ago,

774
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,920
 I was dating my wife and one of the decisions

775
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,900
 that the three of you, oh my gosh.

776
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,660
 (congregation laughing)

777
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,880
 For real, this has gotta change.

778
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,060
 That if you are dating, you are gonna have to go through

779
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,940
 over the holiday season is the evaluation of,

780
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,060
 hey, is this person someone

781
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,560
 that I would like to introduce to my family?

782
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,720
 Am I ready to expose them to the dysfunction

783
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,720
 that I have known so well and for so long?

784
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
 And really, it's almost one of those moments,

785
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,600
 at least for me, I remember 10 years ago

786
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,480
 was when my wife came and met my family.

787
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,700
 And if your family's anything like mine,

788
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,740
 where it's kind of like, oh, buckle up.

789
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,280
 It's like, can this relationship

790
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,480
 endure what they're about to experience here?

791
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,700
 Let's make sure we've formed strong enough bonds

792
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,400
 to where we can be in it together.

793
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,840
 And if you're dating, you're gonna experience that

794
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,040
 to whatever degree you may have dysfunction in your family,

795
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,080
 which let's be honest, everyone has dysfunction

796
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,920
 inside of their family.

797
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,180
 One of the biggest pitfalls that a lot of us can fall into

798
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,520
 over the holiday breaks is how to not grow discouraged,

799
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,720
 frustrated by just the dysfunction

800
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,480
 that you're gonna be around in your family.

801
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,320
 And not just that, but how to be everything

802
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,500
 that God wants you to be during the time,

803
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,920
 during the meals that you're gonna share,

804
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,160
 during just the time that you'll have over Christmas break,

805
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,160
 or maybe you just had over Thanksgiving with family members

806
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,880
 and all the dysfunction that they represent.

807
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,840
 So I don't know where your story is.

808
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,040
 I don't know if when you go home,

809
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,880
 there's your stepbrother who never moved out of the house,

810
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,060
 still playing video games up there,

811
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,600
 or your stepmom who's like taking smoke breaks outside

812
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,600
 every 30 minutes, or your grandma who's like,

813
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,560
 do you wanna get married someday?

814
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,240
 Are you, do you know any girls?

815
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,560
 Or your passive aggressive parents who are like,

816
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,320
 so are you thinking about getting a real job soon?

817
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,200
 Or just anything and everything in between,

818
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,720
 or maybe you've got like the, I feel like there's always,

819
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,840
 one of these in every family,

820
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,720
 there's the super politically passionate sibling

821
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,040
 that's either like, build the wall,

822
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,720
 or like, tear all the walls down,

823
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,700
 and there's just all the craziness that comes with them.

824
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,840
 Or, this is actually true, or you have like an aunt,

825
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,440
 this is just me getting stuff off my chest,

826
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,440
 who is like, they make art out of recyclables,

827
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,040
 and they make their own Christmas gifts

828
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,320
 to give out to people, you're like,

829
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,080
 I know what I'm getting this year for Christmas.

830
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,760
 I don't know what your family dysfunction is

831
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,840
 all across the board, or just sibling rivalry

832
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,880
 and conflict that you have, where you get back there,

833
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,240
 and they bring up that one time you cut off their hair,

834
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,280
 or part of it in sixth grade, and you snap back into like,

835
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,800
 I'm the 16 year old middle child,

836
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,920
 and you always do this kind of thing,

837
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,800
 and just the dysfunction that can be a part of our family.

838
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,240
 Often what usually happens is that same dysfunction,

839
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,920
 and even more serious levels of dysfunction

840
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,000
 cause us to keep our distance,

841
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
 or wanna keep our distance from family.

842
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,720
 And yet, when you look at the story of the Bible,

843
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,080
 and you look at the call on us as Christians,

844
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,320
 the command that God gives us is that

845
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,220
 that is not to be the case.

846
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,240
 So what I wanna talk about is look at the story,

847
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,660
 really, of the initial words of the book of Matthew,

848
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,440
 where Matthew lays out Jesus's introduction

849
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,480
 to his Jewish audience.

850
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,000
 And he begins to talk about Jesus's dysfunctional family.

851
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,600
 Because inside of that, we're gonna learn just

852
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
 a couple truths about how you and I

853
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,000
 can learn about the way that Jesus

854
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,780
 not just had a dysfunctional family,

855
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,280
 but responded and moved towards that dysfunction

856
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,760
 that was represented inside of his family.

857
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,640
 So in Matthew chapter one, it'll be up on the screens,

858
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,240
 this will be really the last thing we'll talk about tonight,

859
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,280
 but here's what you need to know.

860
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,600
 In Matthew chapter one, Matthew writes this book,

861
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,000
 Matthew, to a Jewish audience.

862
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,880
 And he begins to write out why Jesus is the Messiah.

863
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,520
 That's what the book of Matthew, Jewish audience,

864
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,680
 and he writes out, and he begins to write the lineage,

865
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,120
 which was very important at that time,

866
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,040
 really, to the Jewish people, but in general, at that time.

867
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,920
 Here's what normally, when people wrote a lineage,

868
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,800
 they would do.

869
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,960
 They would include kind of the best of the best,

870
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,840
 the who's who, and here he was related to Caesar,

871
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,560
 and all the different famous people

872
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,680
 that were part of their family.

873
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,480
 And they would often, if you study history,

874
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,120
 they would omit some of the, and that guy never existed,

875
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,800
 and they would skip different people.

876
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,560
 And they almost every single time, without exception,

877
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,880
 just 'cause it was a different day and age,

878
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,180
 they didn't include women.

879
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,920
 It was almost strictly men, 'cause the family line

880
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,080
 and family name kind of just passed through.

881
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,360
 But Matthew does something very, very different

882
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,280
 when you read his lineage, that he says,

883
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,380
 hey, this is the lineage of Jesus.

884
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,080
 This is the family that Jesus came from.

885
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,000
 And he not only includes people that you would think,

886
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,120
 why would you include this person inside of you?

887
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,720
 He goes out of his way to include some of the worst

888
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,980
 members of Jesus' lineage.

889
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,540
 He goes out of his way to include women inside of the story,

890
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,680
 which was really unheard of in that day,

891
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,600
 and not just any women.

892
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,760
 Out of these four women, three of them weren't even Jewish.

893
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,520
 And two of them had stories that you just like,

894
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,620
 hey, if you're gonna mention anybody,

895
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,080
 you don't mention her.

896
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,200
 And Matthew goes out of his way to show that Jesus

897
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,720
 and the dysfunction that his family's from.

898
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,280
 So let me read just from these verses in Matthew chapter one

899
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,640
 and we'll see what I'm talking about, which is this.

900
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,640
 This is the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah,

901
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,880
 the son of David, the son of Abraham.

902
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,720
 Abraham was the father of Isaac.

903
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,960
 Isaac was the father of Jacob,

904
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,860
 but Jacob, the father of Judah and his brothers.

905
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,400
 Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah,

906
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,720
 whose mother was Tamar.

907
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,260
 Okay, so everyone that's reading this,

908
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,040
 if you're Matthew's audience at that time,

909
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,160
 you just read about the story of Judah and Tamar.

910
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,600
 You probably haven't read the story

911
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,240
 of Judah and Tamar recently,

912
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
 but it's a story that honestly would be

913
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,280
 like an explicit message if we devoted it to it,

914
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,420
 a sermon on a Tuesday night at the porch.

915
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,600
 Judah ended up sleeping with, accidentally,

916
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,520
 his daughter-in-law, Tamar.

917
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,420
 And they have two twin little baby boys, Perez and Zerah.

918
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,840
 And if you're like, oh man,

919
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,200
 that could have been an innocent mistake,

920
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
 here's why he accidentally slept with her,

921
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,500
 because she was posing as a prostitute.

922
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,960
 So it's not exactly the most exonerating defense.

923
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,280
 Ah, she was acting like a prostitute, that makes sense.

924
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,920
 That's the person that God says is going to be

925
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,880
 one of the great, great, great, great,

926
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,400
 great, great grandparents of Jesus.

927
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,920
 Why would you go out of your way,

928
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,960
 even if this person's in the ancestry, to include them?

929
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,380
 He didn't have to.

930
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,920
 And he includes this woman with a story,

931
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,800
 because as we're about to see,

932
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,440
 that's the point of the story Matthew's about to write.

933
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,040
 He continues, and he goes on from there,

934
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,120
 where he says that Perez was the father of Hezron.

935
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,160
 Hezron, the father of Ram.

936
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
 What a great name is Ram.

937
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,200
 Ram was the father of Aminadab, Aminadabab.

938
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,480
 (congregation laughing)

939
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,440
 Dab, the father of Nashon.

940
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,880
 Nashon was the father of Salmon.

941
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,240
 Salmon was the father of Boaz, whose mother,

942
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,920
 look at this, was Rahab.

943
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,880
 If you were raised in church, you know who Rahab was,

944
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,600
 because Rahab had a nickname that came

945
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,100
 at the end of her name, Rahab the prostitute.

946
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 That he doesn't just include another woman in the story,

947
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,560
 he includes a woman who had an occupation

948
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,880
 that isn't the most glorious occupation that you could have.

949
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,300
 And Matthew goes out of his way.

950
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,160
 If you're gonna include it, why would you include this?

951
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,280
 Like I could make a case, you could see a case where like,

952
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,840
 hey, you're writing lineage, and Mother Teresa's in there,

953
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,400
 and she's, oh, of course, go out of your way

954
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,920
 to include that, or Susan B. Anthony.

955
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,940
 Just wanna make sure you know that's part of the family.

956
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,140
 The prostitute?

957
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,520
 Yeah, hey, this is great-great-grandma.

958
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,960
 She sells sex for money.

959
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,480
 And so here she, I mean, think about that with you

960
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,560
 and your grandma, would you be quick to introduce that

961
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,100
 to your boyfriend or girlfriend?

962
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,560
 Oh yeah, this is my grandma, she was a prostitute for a while

963
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,960
 and that's exactly what he's doing.

964
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,880
 What are you doing, Matthew?

965
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,120
 And it doesn't get any better from there, listen to this.

966
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,140
 And Jesse, verse six, was the father of King David.

967
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,160
 David was the father of Solomon,

968
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,360
 whose mother had been Uriah's wife.

969
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,580
 Uriah's wife was Bathsheba.

970
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,300
 He doesn't even mention Bathsheba.

971
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,060
 He says it in a different way, almost to make sure you know

972
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,060
 the story of David and Bathsheba, and you may not remember

973
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,600
 it, but the story of David and Bathsheba was,

974
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,260
 David was married to several other different women.

975
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,480
 One day, he's out on his palace, he sees this beautiful

976
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,240
 woman taking a bath on the roof of her house,

977
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,820
 not a great idea, ladies, but the story goes on from there,

978
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,500
 and he says, get that woman, bring her to me.

979
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,420
 They say, that's Uriah, one of your best friend's wife.

980
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,020
 He takes her, he sleeps with her, and she gets pregnant,

981
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,420
 and in order to cover it up, he has Uriah killed.

982
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,700
 And this was the story, or this was one of the men

983
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:57,120
 that, and women, that when Matthew's writing the story

984
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,860
 and the lineage of Jesus, he goes out of his way to say,

985
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,380
 Uriah's wife.

986
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,280
 When you look inside of the ancestry of the Messiah

987
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,700
 who's here, you see a very different story than maybe

988
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,680
 the one you would have imagined.

989
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,460
 You see that Jesus came from broken people.

990
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,180
 The story that Jesus did not just come for sinners,

991
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,180
 he came from sinners, and Matthew goes out of his way.

992
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,500
 Think about even that language, and Solomon,

993
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,260
 David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been

994
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,900
 Uriah's wife, oh yeah, whose mom was the wife of another man

995
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,700
 'til David killed him, and that's the little boy

996
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,140
 that God says, hey, I'm gonna continue the line through you.

997
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,780
 Solomon, he's making a very clear point.

998
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:46,800
 He starts there because these people are the point

999
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,620
 of the story Matthew's gonna write about

1000
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,620
 for the next 28 chapters, that Jesus came from sinners

1001
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,940
 and for sinners, like you, like me, like Rahab,

1002
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,980
 and like every dysfunctional person in Jesus's family

1003
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,140
 and in your family.

1004
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,740
 If you come from a dysfunctional home, which we all do,

1005
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,020
 take heart because so did Jesus, but also know

1006
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,200
 that you're gonna have a chance to love on those

1007
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,500
 dysfunctional people because the story of Christmas,

1008
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,140
 the story of Jesus, is that dysfunction doesn't have

1009
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,940
 to mean distance because of Christmas.

1010
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,420
 Just like Jesus looked at the dysfunction of our world,

1011
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,740
 of you and of me, and he didn't say I'm gonna keep

1012
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,140
 my distance because of that, he moved towards those people

1013
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,940
 so you and I will have a chance to demonstrate

1014
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,780
 that same type of moving towards dysfunctional people

1015
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,860
 and loving them that Jesus did, to demonstrate

1016
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,140
 what we celebrate at Christmas.

1017
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,540
 And one of the greatest opportunities you're gonna have

1018
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,680
 is gonna be to love your family.

1019
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,320
 Jesus loves your family.

1020
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,980
 He loves your family way more than you ever will,

1021
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,680
 and he has put you there to be a part of expressing

1022
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,520
 and showing that love.

1023
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,660
 And let me just say this really quickly,

1024
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,700
 and then I'm gonna close, 'cause I'm gonna give you

1025
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,560
 three things that I think as it relates to family

1026
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,460
 that you could do.

1027
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:06,460
 The first one is to see yourself as just having

1028
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,880
 a change in perspective about your time there,

1029
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,360
 a change in perspective, and here it is.

1030
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,300
 You were on a mission trip.

1031
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,440
 You were going on a mission trip.

1032
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,820
 If you're going to spend any time with your family

1033
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,220
 over the holidays, you are officially on a mission trip.

1034
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,300
 And so you have a chance to show the love of Jesus,

1035
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,060
 maybe share your faith, but you were going on a mission

1036
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,380
 trip, just like any mission trip if you've ever been on one,

1037
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,300
 only you don't have to travel to Haiti,

1038
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,700
 and you're gonna go to stay indoors most likely,

1039
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,860
 and speak English to people, and it's a mission trip

1040
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,300
 to people who are trying to give you presents.

1041
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,100
 It's the greatest mission trip ever.

1042
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,580
 (congregation laughing)

1043
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:39,100
 But be assured, it is a mission trip,

1044
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,820
 and you need to change the perspective about the time

1045
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,700
 that you're gonna have there, if you're a Christian.

1046
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,280
 The second thing is to love the family members

1047
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,980
 that are in your family where they are,

1048
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,900
 exactly where they are.

1049
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
 Like don't seek to change them, don't seek to come in,

1050
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,600
 'cause this is really just a big deal.

1051
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,260
 People will leave environments like this,

1052
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,140
 and they'll go home, and they will weaponize their faith,

1053
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,140
 and they will beat people over the head,

1054
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,340
 and tell them how they're sinning, and they're living wrong,

1055
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,460
 and how they need to stop, and God's angry about that.

1056
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,340
 Love your family members exactly where they're at.

1057
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,160
 If you're gonna err, you can err on the side of grace,

1058
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,200
 but seek not to change your family,

1059
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,300
 which you couldn't do anyways, but to love them

1060
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,380
 where they're at, take an interest in them.

1061
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,660
 Ask them questions.

1062
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,460
 Maybe they have a different sexual orientation

1063
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,520
 than the Bible instructs, love them.

1064
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,420
 Stand outside with them when they're taking their smoke break.

1065
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,860
 Be an example, love the family,

1066
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,860
 and move towards the dysfunction, embrace the dysfunction.

1067
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,380
 That's what Jesus did.

1068
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,580
 He wasn't like, hey, get your act together,

1069
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,460
 and then I'll come.

1070
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,060
 Embrace the dysfunction, and in doing so,

1071
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,700
 you demonstrate what all of us at Christmas are celebrating.

1072
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,180
 The God who moves towards those who are dysfunctional,

1073
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,040
 like me, and like you, and finally,

1074
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,340
 that you would seek a chance to share the gospel.

1075
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,340
 One of the easiest ways that you can do this

1076
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,940
 is to share how God is at work inside of your life.

1077
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,260
 Share how God has been at work,

1078
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,300
 and the way that he's growing you.

1079
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,000
 It's not offensive.

1080
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,260
 Seek to move the conversation in a direction that's there.

1081
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,700
 Maybe they are Christians already,

1082
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,580
 they're just not experiencing everything God wants.

1083
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,740
 Invite them to awaken.

1084
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,060
 And say, hey, I'd love for you to come with me.

1085
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,100
 We can be a part of it together,

1086
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,680
 and they can see, catch a glimpse,

1087
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,060
 maybe of what some of you have seen together.

1088
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,220
 But in conclusion, change your perspective.

1089
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,840
 Love your family as they are.

1090
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,940
 Seek to share the gospel.

1091
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,060
 Christmas is a celebration of the first mission trip.

1092
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,400
 That's what it is.

1093
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,140
 Where God of the universe decided,

1094
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,680
 I will lay aside all of my comfort,

1095
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,260
 the eternal heavenly realm,

1096
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,860
 and I will set those things aside,

1097
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,820
 and I will move towards the dysfunctional human race.

1098
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,460
 The first mission trip was initiated.

1099
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,060
 And he came down and was born in a manger

1100
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,300
 to die on a tree for dysfunctional people

1101
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,640
 like you and like me.

1102
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,440
 And he's invited us now to be a part

1103
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,700
 of living on mission and going on mission to our family.

1104
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,420
 Those who know him and those who don't

1105
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,700
 that we'll spend time with.

1106
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,860
 Let me pray.

1107
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,460
 Father, I pray for just the opportunities

1108
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,880
 that we're gonna have to share our faith.

1109
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,660
 Would you, Lord, stretch out your hand

1110
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,700
 and save family members like the ones in my family

1111
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,660
 who don't know you?

1112
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,780
 And would you open their eyes to the truth?

1113
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,780
 Would you use the conversations that I'm gonna get to have

1114
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,620
 to be a part of that?

1115
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,360
 I pray for friends in the room who have family members,

1116
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,980
 siblings who have fathers, mothers,

1117
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,460
 step-parents that don't know you.

1118
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,580
 Would you stretch out your hand and save them, God?

1119
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,540
 Would you help us to have our first reaction be love?

1120
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,360
 Would we love people just where they are, care for them,

1121
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,660
 get to know 'em, earn the right to speak

1122
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,760
 in greater ways into their life?

1123
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,180
 Thank you for just the men and women

1124
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,620
 who you've placed in different families

1125
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,860
 all over this country and other countries

1126
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,020
 that are just sitting right in front of me

1127
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,420
 and listening wherever they are gathered right now.

1128
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,940
 You've grabbed many of our hearts.

1129
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,500
 Would you use us to be a part of loving our family?

1130
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,780
 Would we not waste our break

1131
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,260
 and take a holiday from our faith over the holidays?

1132
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,900
 We worship you now in song, amen.

1133
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,740
 - Where David Ended reminds me of a story

1134
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,460
 that Philip Yancey tells.

1135
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,540
 Philip Yancey is a writer, was a journalist,

1136
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,340
 and he talks about having a fish aquarium.

1137
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:35,060
 And all of the work that goes into making this biosphere,

1138
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,300
 this place of life for these fish perfect,

1139
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,020
 that he would clean the tank and filter the water

1140
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,940
 and put this aerator in there,

1141
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,020
 and then he'd put these pebbles down

1142
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,100
 and these little statues and places for the fish to live,

1143
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,940
 and he would do everything within his power,

1144
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,080
 invest so much of his money and his time and his resources

1145
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,860
 in making this place the perfect place for the fish to live.

1146
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,660
 And then he remembers his disappointment.

1147
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,660
 He recalls his disappointment upon his first time

1148
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,020
 walking up to the tank and the fish swimming off

1149
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,660
 and hiding behind the statues

1150
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,420
 and the little things that he put in there.

1151
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,700
 They were afraid of him.

1152
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:26,660
 And all he wanted was a pet, like he wanted a relationship.

1153
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:32,620
 And he realized to connect with the fish,

1154
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,680
 he would have to become one.

1155
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,100
 And this is what happens at Christmas.

1156
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,500
 The Creator God makes this place,

1157
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,620
 and he fine-tunes it perfect so that you can live

1158
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,180
 and thrive and have life.

1159
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:53,900
 Made you to be in a relationship with him,

1160
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,640
 and you've spent your life running away.

1161
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:05,060
 And he says to rightfully have a relationship with them

1162
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,840
 so that they know that they can trust me,

1163
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,260
 I'd have to become a fish.

1164
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,460
 I'd have to become a human.

1165
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,940
 I'd have to enter into their world,

1166
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,780
 become like one of them.

1167
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,080
 And this is what happens at Christmas.

1168
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,700
 It's the greatest mission trip that ever happened.

1169
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,280
 God leaving his place of perfection,

1170
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,780
 putting on humanity, coming to the earth.

1171
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,740
 And you know what else he does?

1172
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,500
 Sometimes because he loves you,

1173
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,940
 he removes those things you're hiding behind.

1174
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,780
 He takes them out.

1175
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,140
 He pulls them away.

1176
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,000
 He's doing some of that for you tonight.

1177
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,060
 If we can help you, if we can come alongside you,

1178
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,220
 if you want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ,

1179
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,580
 the one who came here 2018 years ago,

1180
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,420
 we'd love to talk to you.

1181
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,400
 There'll be a bunch of people up here in some port shirts.

1182
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,060
 They'd love to pray with you, hear your story,

1183
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,380
 and talk more, and you just come right up here.

1184
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,460
 We also have open community group tonight,

1185
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,300
 and so if you know that you don't have relationships

1186
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,380
 with other Christians, guys, you walk down this hallway,

1187
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,820
 and girls, you walk down this hallway,

1188
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,940
 and right outside those hallways,

1189
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,800
 there's rooms full of other people

1190
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,620
 that are just looking to hear more

1191
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,860
 about this idea of community.

1192
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,460
 I'd encourage you to do that next.

1193
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,940
 Just go right in there, and they would love to chat with you.

1194
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,300
 And then lastly, I'll just end how we started.

1195
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,380
 Please, every one of you, I'm talking to you.

1196
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,460
 If you're like, I wonder if he's talking to me,

1197
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,380
 I'm talking to you.

1198
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,380
 Would you check out awaken.live?

1199
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,820
 We're not trying to sell tickets.

1200
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,660
 We're trying to change the world for the cause of Jesus.

1201
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,340
 We think he's letting us.

1202
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,180
 How about that?

1203
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,160
 We think he's allowing us to,

1204
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,560
 and we want you to be a part of it.

1205
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,960
 Just go to awaken.live.

1206
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,840
 You can see more information there,

1207
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,440
 but it's gonna be the thing

1208
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,480
 that I don't want you to miss out on.

1209
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,740
 Okay?

1210
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:11,620
 I love you guys.

1211
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,000
 Go in peace, to love, and serve the Lord.

1212
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,160
 Have a Merry Christmas.
