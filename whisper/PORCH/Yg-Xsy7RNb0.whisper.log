[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.000]   >> Hey guys.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.660]   Okay, now all the guys in the room are like, she's going to talk about emotions.
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.040]   There's a girl teaching and we're going to talk about our emotions.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.540]   And I'm going to tell you right now, this is going to be the best marriage advice you will ever get.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.880]   The best friendship advice.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.640]   I know you all are like, we're not married.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.260]   You might be one day.
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.520]   And I'm just going to save you thousands of dollars on counseling
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.580]   because this subject is everything.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:00.020]   And whether you are someone that expresses your emotions easily and you're all over the place emotionally
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.840]   or you're someone who holds them all in, you are an emotional being.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.800]   You were built by God to be an emotional being.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   Now let me start with a question.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.320]   How many of you would say emotions are bad?
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.340]   Any of you?
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.540]   How many of you would say emotions are neutral?
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000]   How many of you would say emotions are good?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420]   Good, good, okay.
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.760]   You're healthy.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.160]   You've done some counseling, many of you.
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.780]   I will say this.
[00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.660]   Largely, believers in the church has been confused on that question.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.680]   Are emotions good?
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.620]   Are emotions bad?
[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.140]   Because it sure feels like we're all pretty jacked up with them.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.440]   This is the picture I drew when I started this project because this is what I felt.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.060]   And the reason the book is called this is because this is the way that my emotions felt to me.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.200]   And I think it's the way a lot of people's emotions feel to them.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.780]   I remember being in the backseat.
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.740]   I was seven years old and I was leaving the funeral of my great grandmother, Muncie.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.460]   And I didn't know Muncie very well.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.260]   But I was seven years old and I'm sitting in the backseat with my parents in the front seat.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.620]   And I'm crying as quietly as I can.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.740]   Not because I loved Muncie.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.900]   I mean, she was my great grandmother.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.140]   I remember she had a cuckoo clock.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.380]   Like there's just very little context I had for this woman.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.940]   But I remember, I remember driving and I remember looking out the window.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.980]   I remember being seven years old and crying because I was scared to die.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.260]   And I remember another thought.
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.660]   There was part of my brain at seven years old that was scared to die and was crying,
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.780]   looking at the stars and thinking about God and thinking that I don't want to die.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.860]   And there was part of my brain that was saying, cry really quietly so that your parents don't hear you
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.300]   because they'll think it's weird that you're crying about your great grandmother that you didn't know very well.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.980]   There was part of my brain that was crying for a really good reason.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.620]   Like I look back at that seven year old Jenny and I, I tear up now thinking about her because I'm thinking,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.300]   I get why you're crying about death like that.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.980]   I don't know whether you lost a fish first or a dog or a grandparent or a parent.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.340]   I don't know when your first encounter was with death, but likely it overwhelmed you.
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.900]   Of course, seven year old Jenny was a little overwhelmed.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.980]   That's what I want to say to her.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.100]   I want to pick her up and go, baby girl, of course you are scared to death.
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.740]   Let me process it with you.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.420]   Sometimes I am scared to death too.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.260]   But yet there was another part of my brain.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.900]   And I think it's why we're all mixed up.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:02.980]   I think it's that tornado we feel about it that was telling me the whole time, don't cry too loud because you don't want your parents to hear.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.620]   I was judging that I was sad at seven years old.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.620]   Our emotions good, our emotions bad, our emotions neutral.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:24.340]   Now we all know that they are causing a whole lot of trouble everywhere we look.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.860]   We know that emotions are causing trouble everywhere we look.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.700]   And so because of that, what we see is the world has said, okay, this is, this is the way it works.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:48.540]   Life is a little bit chaotic and it feels like I don't know if I believe in God, so I don't know what's coming.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.780]   So this life is all there is.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.340]   And then the way that I feel and what I feel inside becomes everything.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.500]   So emotions become everything.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.860]   And whatever we feel, we chase.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.420]   And that is the way that the world largely has lived.
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.140]   And let me just say, I don't think it's a bad plan if there is no God.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.620]   In fact, Paul said, let us eat and drink because tomorrow we die.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:17.140]   Right. It's like if this is all there is, then let's go have the best, let's meet every desire we have, every feeling we have.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.300]   If there is nothing after this and it's meaningless, go have fun.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.540]   Follow your feelings, follow your heart.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.900]   But we know it leads to destruction.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.220]   Right. And so the world is following our feelings and sometimes we are following our feelings and it is leading to destruction.
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.980]   And so therefore, the church has responded and the church has said emotions are dangerous.
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.860]   Emotions aren't reliable.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.140]   Emotions aren't trustworthy.
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.900]   And all of a sudden we have demonized emotions.
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.780]   And just like that seven year old little girl in the backseat, we're sitting there not only feeling sad and angry and confused.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.380]   But now we're also judging it.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.420]   And there's a big part of our soul that's judging it.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.460]   We're going to look at two words in scripture tonight, two words.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.140]   Jesus wept.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.180]   We're going to unpack those two words tonight.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:24.540]   But before we do, I want to pray and I want to ask God to transform our mind because like Grace said, I've been working on this for a year.
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.140]   It kind of feels like I'm coming out from disheveled papers and a mess.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.420]   And I'm nervous to bring this to you all today because I've worked on it for so long.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.540]   But what I know to be true is it has transformed my life and my relationships.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.180]   It has transformed it.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.260]   It's changed the way I view one of these most important things in life.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:53.580]   And so God transform the way we view this, redeem our view of emotions, redeem emotions in us.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.660]   Help us to see it how you see it.
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.260]   Help us to feel how you feel and then help us to live out of those feelings in a healthy way.
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.140]   Help us in Jesus name.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.580]   I want to show you a picture of my family.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.780]   So there's, I've got four kids and now I have a new son in law.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:26.140]   And I remember when my daughter was 10 years old, my oldest daughter, it was my turn to have the talk with my daughter.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.740]   Y'all got me?
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.180]   So I have the talk with her at Sonic.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.780]   I take her to Sonic and I just dropped it like a bomb.
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.180]   I said, this is what happens.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.500]   This is where babies are made.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.620]   This is how it goes.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.460]   The end.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.460]   And she started weeping.
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.900]   I was like, that did not go how I thought.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.740]   So let's go to the mall.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.540]   So we go to the mall.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.860]   I'm like, let's change the subject.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.380]   I'm going to go read some more books about this and how to do this better.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.580]   And I'll come back to this.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.540]   And so I'm thinking she'll forget it.
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.260]   And so we go to the mall.
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.140]   We're gone for two hours and we drive back into our driveway.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.060]   And right before we go in, I think she's moved on and forgotten it.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:13.820]   Right before we go in, she grabs my arm and she says, mom, I need to thank you for what you did for us three times.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:22.900]   And I totally understand why we adopted Cooper.
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:34.380]   Now, sex is one of those things God made.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.340]   It's one of those crazy, great things that God made that's so confusing.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.540]   It's so confusing.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.780]   And I'll tell you today, my daughter is married and she's sitting over here right now.
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.620]   And I'm sure she loves me telling you all this story.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.060]   But she's married today.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.660]   And guess what?
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.860]   Her view of sex today is very different than her view at 10 years old.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:03.020]   And her view of sex at 40 something is going to be very different than her view of it at 20 something.
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.420]   And her view of it at 80 something is going to be very different than her view of it at 40 something.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:17.580]   Because sex is a mysterious, awesome gift that God gave us that is really hard to get our head around while we're on earth.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.460]   And it gets twisted and it gets messed up.
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.900]   And y'all, sex and emotions aren't so different.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.220]   God built our emotions.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.180]   He built them.
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.540]   He gifted them to us.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.180]   And he has a plan for them.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:40.620]   And I want to start just with in case you don't know theologically, in case you were like, I don't know if it's good or bad or neutral.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.580]   Let me just start with how God feels.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.860]   We know that emotions are good because we have a God that feels.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.740]   So in Genesis, you see that that emotions cannot be a sin because God is feeling like crazy.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.020]   He creates and he loves what he created.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.620]   He delights over what he's created.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:07.700]   And then creation rebels and he's disappointed and he's hurt that that creation has rebelled.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:14.140]   And then he feels delight when Abraham and David and others follow him and and submit to him.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.620]   And then he feels anger.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:22.260]   Numbers 32 says that the Lord burned with anger at Israel because they wouldn't believe him.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   So there's a war going on in God.
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.180]   There is anger, delight, disappointment.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.940]   You see all of that just in Genesis, the beginning of the scriptures.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:37.980]   And time and time again, we see God express his compassion toward humanity.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:42.020]   He is regularly, in fact, the word compassion is used so often in the Bible.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.940]   He is moved with compassion to his people.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.060]   It says that the Lord is not slow to fulfill his promises.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:54.460]   Some count slowness, but is patient towards you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:04.500]   And then Jesus comes and it says even before Jesus comes in Isaiah, it says that Jesus is a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:14.260]   And then we see Jesus face the cross and at the Garden of Gethsemane, we get this glimpse into this intimate moment with with the Trinity.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.020]   Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.500]   And Jesus is troubled and he's afraid and he's sweating as if it's drops of blood.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.780]   And it says that he is in agony.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:33.460]   And that word agony in the Greek is it actually is translated almost every time into anxiety or fear.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.420]   So you see a God that even struggles with fear.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.820]   He experiences fear.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.780]   Why on earth would these emotions be in God?
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.940]   He knows what's going to happen.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.300]   He knows everything.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.380]   He can fix anything.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.220]   Why would these emotions exist?
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.420]   Jesus wept.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.700]   It's a story.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.940]   If you haven't read it, those verses are found around the death of one of his good friends.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:22.940]   And in this moment where he knows that his friend is dead and he's not yet with his friend, he stops his people from going back.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:31.260]   And it says in John 11 that before we go to Lazarus, he's going to fall asleep, but I'm going to wake him up.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.660]   So he announces to his disciples, we're going to go see Lazarus and he's going to be asleep.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.460]   But I'm going to wake him up.
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:44.340]   And then he arrives on the scene and Martha greets him and she's mad.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.860]   In John 11, she's mad.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.140]   She's angry.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.780]   And she lets him know it because if you would have been here, he wouldn't have died.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.380]   And it is her faith that makes her angry.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.340]   She's ticked.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.220]   Why weren't you here?
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.660]   If you were here, this wouldn't have happened.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.060]   And he comforts her and he doesn't scold her and he doesn't judge her.
[00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.460]   And he says, listen, I am the resurrection.
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.140]   He gives her hope.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.220]   I'm the resurrection and the life and the one who believes in me will live even though they die.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.460]   And whoever lives by believing in me will never die.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.700]   He gives her hope.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.740]   He gives her comfort.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.780]   Have you ever been angry at God?
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:33.260]   I actually want to pause for a minute and I want you to think about the strongest emotion you've felt recently.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.500]   What is it?
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.500]   Anger, fear, sadness.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.500]   I want you to think of what we consider a negative emotion.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.300]   When have you felt a negative emotion recently and what was it?
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.140]   You have it?
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.580]   Oh, yeah. Talk to me.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.100]   Fear.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.140]   What else?
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.420]   Grief.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.620]   Anger.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.500]   Sadness.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.380]   Loneliness.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.380]   Okay.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.700]   This is what I want you to do.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.500]   I want you to tell your neighbor.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.020]   What that feeling made you feel.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:20.620]   I want you to say when I got angry, when I got sad, I felt.
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.740]   Uncomfortable. I felt.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.020]   Happy to be sad.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.100]   What do you feel?
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.540]   What do you feel about what you felt?
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.100]   Got it.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.420]   I know some of you guys are like, this is way over my head.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.660]   Try it. Go.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.660]   (Laughter)
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.660]   (Laughter)

[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.660]   (Laughter)
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.660]   (Laughter)
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.660]   (Laughter)

[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.660]   All right.
[00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.660]   Now talk to me.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.660]   What do you feel about what you feel?
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.660]   Stupid.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.660]   Overwhelmed.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.660]   Frustrated.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.660]   Say it again.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   Hopeless.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.660]   Purposeless.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   Anxious.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.660]   Afraid of what you feel.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   Okay.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.660]   I want you to picture your brain and I want you to picture little parts of it, okay?
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.660]   Have you all seen Inside Out?
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:50.660]   I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:15.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:39.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:17:08.660]   And I want you to imagine that there's a part of it that gets mad.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.960]   could navigate a mixed-up world. It feels like it's all crazy because part of your
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.640]   brain is telling you stop feeling that way. I don't know how you're wired many
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.600]   of the guys will actually relate to the way I am but I am actually not that
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.320]   emotional. I am passionate, I am zealous, but I don't cry a lot. I don't like to
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.240]   cry. I think crying feels silly because it's in my mind I theologize it and I'm
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.560]   like you know what it's all gonna be fine in the end so let's just deal with
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.120]   it right now and let's just do the best we can and let's get through it. That
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.480]   just makes sense to me. And I was at a little group therapy thing which I
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.680]   highly recommend. It's very uncomfortable and I don't enjoy it every time. I
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.800]   literally go and I know that I need to go and I don't want to go but I showed
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.100]   up at our first gathering together and I'm sitting there and I know that when
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.880]   we get to this we are supposed to share our guts out. We are supposed to show up
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.760]   and share our sadness and share our fear and share our anger and I was like this
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.200]   is just stupid but I'm gonna do it and so I literally rolled up my sleeves and
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:25.180]   I went about first and I sat down and I wept. This is about two years ago. I wept
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.080]   and I said I and I'm just hitting the table and I'm saying all the things that
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.480]   I thought they wanted to hear which was why I was sad, why I was tired, why I was
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.280]   angry, how it felt like there were times that God had called me out on the ocean
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:44.680]   where feet may fail and they failed. That's what happened and I I felt like
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:51.600]   God was wasn't fair and God was asking too much and and I was I wasn't sure
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.280]   that I trusted him and I mean I just I I was as candid as you could possibly be
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.480]   and I felt really proud because I did the thing that they'd asked me to do and
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:09.200]   I I stopped and they all looked at me and they started saying things like I
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:19.640]   don't think God's that way Jenny. I think God loves you. God wouldn't do that and
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:30.200]   something inside of me completely shut down because I had just braved thoughts
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:38.440]   that I had never said out loud and I had shared with them like my guts and all
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.840]   of a sudden I felt like they were trying to fix me and they were judging me for
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   feeling that way and we had a counselor in the room and he stopped the room and
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.480]   he said Jenny how do you feel right now? How does that make you feel? See we are
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.680]   really good at answering the question what does that make you think but we are
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:09.280]   not so comfortable or good at saying how does that make you feel and so I said
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.480]   well let me tell you how I feel. I feel ticked and I really don't want to be
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.600]   here anymore and I don't want to share anything with y'all because I feel judged
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.280]   and I just I kept playing the game. I did really well. I said all the feelings and
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:26.520]   they their faces changed and they're like oh my gosh I'm so sorry. I'm so
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:35.440]   sorry. We love you. We're proud of you. Like we I hear you. I can imagine that
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.280]   you would feel that way and all of a sudden there was this safety in the room
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.000]   that makes me feel sad that you feel hurt. Now you got to realize we're at
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.920]   three layers of feelings okay. So I have felt, they have felt about what I felt
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.360]   and now I have felt about what they have felt about what I felt and now they are
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   telling me how they feel about what I felt. You got it. But something shifted in
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.720]   me that day because I am usually them. I am the one that is usually trying to fix
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:08.120]   them with truth. I am the one that is usually trying to answer the problem and
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:14.480]   fix it. Y'all my son recently he shows up and asks his first girl out to a dance
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.720]   and he is so nervous about it and the girl said no.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:30.960]   So he comes home and he's really sad about it and let me tell you what I
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:39.000]   wanted to do. I was like oh buddy we're gonna ask the finest other girl in this
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.120]   school. We are gonna get you, you are gonna look so good on that night. Shoot
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.960]   you're 15 we're gonna get you a hardship license. You're gonna be the only
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:51.200]   freshman to pick up their date on homecoming night. Like we are gonna win.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   Like we are gonna fix this problem.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.520]   But that was not what he needed in that moment. You know what he needed? Me to be
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.120]   sad with him. He needed me to just be with him be like you know man that
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   stinks with stronger language. Because in those moments something in our heart was
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:31.360]   built, built by God to mourn with those who mourn. There was something about
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:38.200]   mourning with those who mourn that would heal our souls and Jesus knew it before
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.280]   scientists figured it out and counselors figured it out recently. He knew it which
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.960]   is why in the scripture is so clear that we are to mourn with those who mourn and
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.600]   so now let's go back to the story of Lazarus. Now Jesus is past Martha. He's
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.520]   loved her, he's comforted her in her anger toward him and now he walks up to
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:05.080]   Mary and Mary falls apart when she sees her friend. It says when Jesus saw her
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:10.680]   weeping and the Jews who had come with her also weeping he was deeply moved in
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:16.240]   his spirit and greatly troubled. He was and I want you to see what made him cry.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:23.440]   What made it, let's see the verse up here, what made him cry when Jesus saw her
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:32.480]   crying. That is what moved him deeply in his spirit. He was greatly troubled and
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.560]   he said where have you laid him and they said to him Lord come and see Jesus
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:43.400]   wept. This is one of the most profound scriptures and it will completely change
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:49.360]   the way you interact with humans for the rest of your life because we already saw
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:55.480]   earlier in John 11 that he knew that Lazarus was going to be dead and he knew
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:24:00.220]   that he was going to raise him from the dead. He already announced it so this is
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.760]   already in the plans. It's not something that he thought about after he was bummed
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.880]   that his friend was dead. It wasn't like Jesus wept okay I think I should raise
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:13.240]   him from the dead because I can. No he knew he was gonna do it. Let me tell you
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:21.160]   as a fixer how I would have handled this situation. Mary quit crying it's all good
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.440]   I got you watch this and I would raise him from the dead. I would not sit there
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.680]   and cry with her because why? He's going to fix the problem but it isn't about
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:40.040]   the circumstances. It isn't about fixing the problem. It's not about fixing the
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:46.240]   problem. It's about not being afraid to stop and be present in the pain with
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:57.320]   Mary. What made Jesus weep was seeing her weep and so he weeps with her. He stops
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:07.920]   himself from fixing the problem and he weeps with her. It's a completely
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.840]   different way of living and I will tell you if you are not used to doing this
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.600]   with people if you're not used to doing this with yourself it is so scary
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.080]   because it doesn't feel like it actually helps. It doesn't feel like it actually
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.680]   changes anything. This truth beating it over someone's head crying maybe that
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:38.800]   would change something but does it? I'm not saying truth doesn't help but there
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:45.260]   is something before truth is received that happens inside of us when we
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:54.520]   actually connect with another person and feel what they're feeling. So as I was
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.680]   doing this work I also did the scientific work and it was so cool
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:04.200]   because what scientists realized that is that one of the only ways to heal from
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.880]   trauma is to connect with another person in their pain so that we were never
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.480]   meant to be alone in our pain and that one of the only things that actually
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.320]   heals neuropathways that break because of trauma is being in the pain with
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.560]   someone else and I just thought that was so cool like to think or to picture
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.640]   little neuropathways like fighting their way back to each other that have been
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.760]   broken because of difficulty or death or trauma they're fighting their way back
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.680]   to each other and and they're trying to get back to each other and that the way
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.600]   those little neuropathways heal and come back together is that someone mourns with
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:52.000]   you in your pain. I think about little seven-year-old Jenny and what she needed
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.880]   was for her parents to hear her crying. You know what she needed? She needed for
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:04.960]   them to pull over and to explain death and to help her not feel so afraid of it.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:12.640]   She needed in that moment connection. See emotions are gifts from God given to us
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.720]   to navigate a crazy world but they're given to us for a bigger reason than
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:22.200]   that. They are given to us to connect us deeply to God and to connect us deeply
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.240]   to other people. All those things when they untangle and when you get connected
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   to God I mean I want you to think of I want you to think of a time when somebody
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.480]   cried with you. When somebody sat across from you and they started to cry and
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.160]   they didn't mean to maybe they said I'm sorry but I want you to think how you
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:45.720]   felt inside when someone vulnerably shared with you and cried with you. How
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:56.760]   did you feel? How did you feel? Heard. Known. Understood. Loved. Honored. That somebody
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:03.440]   would cry with you and yet why are we apologizing? Why are we judging it like
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:10.640]   this is the good stuff. This is the best stuff. This is the stuff that actually
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.840]   forges relationships. Walking through difficulty together this is where for
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.920]   the rest of your life you never want to lose that person that walked through
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.840]   your parents divorce with you. You never want to lose the person that showed up
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.140]   at your house after your parent died night after night after night or after
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:35.200]   the breakup. Anything little or big that feels traumatic our brain breaks unless
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.880]   someone is with us in the pain and the beautiful thing is God knew it and he
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.560]   knew that it wasn't just about bringing Lazarus back from the dead it was about
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:50.640]   helping Mary in her pain to know that it's okay to be angry for Martha and
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:57.920]   that it's okay to be sad for Mary. It's not just okay it's the right response to
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:05.400]   a freaking broken world. Have you ever seen a documentary that had no emotion
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:15.840]   in it? It's so boring. It's the worst and some of us are living that way. Some of us
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:24.240]   are living a numb boring dead life because we are scared of pain because we
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.040]   are scared of anger because we are scared of feeling sadness because we are
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:36.600]   scared of looking at our past because we are afraid and I get it and I get it and
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.400]   I get it because on this side when you think about the damage that emotions
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:47.280]   have caused I get it but guys it doesn't say don't be angry. Scripture says don't
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.000]   sin in your anger. The problem is not our emotions the problem is what do we do on
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.120]   the other side of them. So we feel the feeling we don't fix the feeling we feel
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.480]   the feeling and we let that feeling connect us to God and connect us to
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.960]   other people and as we live that way and as we do that over and over again it is
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:16.680]   embarrassing some days. It can be humiliating to do but it is transformative.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:23.600]   It changes everything. Me crying with my kid he was fine. He asked another girl
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:30.200]   she said yes it's fine it's fine but you know what he knows it's okay to be sad
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:41.600]   with me and that lets me be with him in his sadness and that lets his little
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:55.280]   brain heal and that is what God wants for you and I know for some of you it
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.800]   feels like I'm pushing you up to an abyss and you are standing over the edge
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:08.920]   and you're like if I go down here I am terrified of what I'm gonna feel and I
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:15.240]   don't know what's down here. Let me tell you what's down here.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:25.040]   Jesus he's down there and he wanted us to know it. He stopped to cry with Mary
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:35.720]   so that you knew when you wept that he was weeping with you. He's down there and
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.080]   he also has built like some handles on the side of the rock and he's like
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.240]   listen I know it looks dark but if you take the first step and you feel the
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   sadness or you feel the anger I will help you with it. I will help you
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.000]   navigate it and people are down there. People that love you that are sitting
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.880]   beside you or people that you don't even know yet that want to live this way are
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:03.000]   there and they want to come around you. All of that's down there. It's not easy
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.600]   but we're gonna practice right now. Everybody's like oh it's doing so good
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:13.760]   till that. It sounded like a great idea in theory and we're gonna try it right now
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.080]   and I just want you to get comfortable and I want you to close your eyes and I
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.960]   want you to think back to that that feeling that you mentioned that last
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:27.680]   feeling that you felt. The sadness or the anger or the fear.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:36.760]   [silence]
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.480]   And I want you just to feel it. I know that sounds kind of crazy talk but I
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:47.840]   want you to just feel it. The sadness, the fear, the anger. I want you to sit with it
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.760]   for just a second.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:33:11.040]   [silence]
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:17.960]   Keep your eyes closed and I want you to imagine
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:25.240]   that you're sitting somewhere awesome, beautiful and I want you to imagine
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.280]   Jesus walks up.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:35.000]   And I want you to imagine that he's sitting right across from you and he is
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.960]   watching you cry or he is watching you at the table or he is watching you be
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:47.040]   afraid. In fact I want you just to tell him about it right now just in your
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.720]   heart. I want you to say this is what I'm mad about, this is what I'm scared of, this
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:58.320]   is what I am angry about, this is what I'm sad about. Just tell him.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:28.240]   [silence]
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:38.880]   [silence]
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.200]   And now I want you to imagine how he's looking at you.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.080]   [silence]
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.840]   What's his expression? What does he feel?
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:35:19.760]   [silence]
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:28.640]   [silence]
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:36.320]   Hebrews tells us, Jesus, that you are acquainted with our weaknesses, that you
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.160]   have felt our infirmities.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.960]   [silence]
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.160]   Thank you for that.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   [silence]
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   Thank you that none of us ever fall asleep crying alone.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:03.920]   Because you are with us.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:10.160]   And you cry with us.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.160]   And I thank you that our feelings don't overwhelm you and that they don't
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:23.040]   scare you, that they actually, it is your delight to be in them with us.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.960]   It's like this honing beacon that is drawing us back to you, like
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.160]   yeah it's broken, I need God, I need hope.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.840]   It's hard, I need Jesus, it's good, I want to worship, it's
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.960]   wrong, I want justice, and you're all those things,
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:49.520]   you're all the good parts and the hard parts, you're all of it.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:54.240]   And you are our comforter.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:02.400]   And God, I know that a life lived in the fullest is not lived numb.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.960]   It's lived with all of this as you lived it here and showed us on earth
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:14.080]   all the feelings.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:19.680]   And yet you promise us that one day every tear will be dried,
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:28.400]   and every sadness will be over and gone with you. A time is coming
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.760]   where tears will be no more and we believe it,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:38.560]   and yet we still thank you that in the brokenness today you have grace for us.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:46.000]   And you want us to come to you in it. So for the hope that we have, we thank
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.200]   you. For the joy that we have, we thank you. And
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:57.120]   for the sadness and the tears, we also thank you.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:04.000]   And just help us know how to live out of
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.560]   the way that you built us to live. Holy and loving and compassionate,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:19.040]   worshipful and thankful, and also sad at the brokenness and angry
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.880]   at the injustice and scared of what is rightfully scary.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.400]   And yet come into you again and again and again no matter what.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:43.200]   Thanks for always being there in that. We trust you. Amen.
