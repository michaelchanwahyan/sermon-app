[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.800]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   Sometimes in life you look at things and
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   you just kind of see a mess.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   And inside you're like, I think it's supposed to be beautiful.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   Maybe it's a dove. I don't know, man.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   Beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.800]   Maybe it's something, maybe I'm missing it.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   Maybe everybody sees it.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   Some are acting like it's good.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   But I just, I don't know, it's kind of ugly.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   I don't get it.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   And then it gets flipped.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   How many of you, by show of hands, saw that coming?
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   How many of you have seen that before
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   and you knew it was something?
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800]   Keep your hands up.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.800]   So some of you, you've seen that illustration
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.800]   or you've seen Lance's gifts before
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.800]   and you're like, okay, I know what's going to happen.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   I see Jesus' face there.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800]   I know how this is going to go down.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.800]   Let me tell you something.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   Those of you that knew it was coming,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   you had a very different attitude than the rest of us.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   Because there towards the end,
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800]   those of you that didn't see it coming,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   you started to feel embarrassed.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.800]   You started like, oh man, I think he messed up
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   or he's the big eraser, you know.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   Can we just start over?
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.800]   Shane, start singing again.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.800]   Let's give this guy another shot.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   You feel bad for him.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   And you're like, oh no, things just went awry.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800]   That's what you were feeling.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   But those of you that knew what was coming,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   you felt something completely different.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   You thought, okay, just wait for it.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   Just wait for it, man. It's coming.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.800]   Life is that way.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Life is that way for believers,
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800]   you know God is going to do something good.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.800]   You just need to wait.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.800]   You just need to hold on. Hold fast.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800]   Wait for it. Wait for it. He's not done yet.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   He's going to make this good.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.800]   He's going to make this right.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.800]   You hold on with that hope.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   While others are looking at it,
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.800]   all I see is something ugly, man.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   So if you're here for the first time,
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.800]   we want to welcome you.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   Fort Worth, we want to welcome you.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   Houston, I know that you're streaming from your homes
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.800]   because of the flooding situation there.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   We welcome you guys. We're praying for you guys.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.800]   If you're here with the Church Leaders Conference,
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   welcome. We are talking tonight.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   We're going through a series, Romans 8,
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.800]   walking by the Spirit.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   We're talking tonight
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   how God can flip
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   everything for good.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   The scripture we're going to be in tonight
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   is just where we're landing in this series.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   It just happens to be where we're at.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   It is overflowing with hope.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   It shows how God can flip the script
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   in any given situation.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   If you're not in troubles right now,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   and you're like, "Well, I don't really need that right now.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.800]   Life is good right now.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   I just got a raise,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   and I'm in a new relationship,
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   and everything's working out."
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   If that's where you're at right now, just wait.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   Jesus says, "In this world,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   you will have troubles."
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   It's one of the promises He makes us.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   Troubles are coming your way, unbearable, unthinkable,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.800]   unfathomable troubles.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   I'm not wishing that on you.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   That's not a prophecy or anything.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.800]   As a matter of fact, if God gives you long enough,
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800]   you are going to face sickness,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   death of loved ones,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.800]   hurts, deep, deep,
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   sorrowful hurts that you will need
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   help getting through.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   This verse offers you the help.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.800]   If that's where you're at right now,
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.800]   I hope you cling to every word in this verse.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.800]   We're in Romans 8, if you want to turn there.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   I'm going to be in verse 28 through 30 this evening.
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800]   Just as a reminder, Paul wrote this
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   in about 57 AD
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.800]   to the church in Rome
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   whom he had not met.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.800]   There's a very turbulent culture
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.800]   going on in Rome as Paul writes this
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   letter to them, offering them
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   hope. Last week,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   David talked about how creation
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   groans for the return of Christ
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   and how the resurrection offers us this
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.800]   hope. Tonight, we're going to elaborate on that
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   hope. I'll just read these verses.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   He says this in verse 28, "And we know
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   that in all things God works for the good
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   of those who love Him, who have been called
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   according to His purpose.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.800]   For those God foreknew, He also
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   predestined to be conformed to the image
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   of His Son, that He might be
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.800]   the firstborn among many brothers
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   and sisters. And those He
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   predestined, He also called. And those He called,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   He also justified. And those He justified,
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   He also glorified."
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.800]   From these three verses, we're going to look at three promises
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   from the text.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   How He makes good from our bad.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.800]   What that good
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   actually is.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   And how the best is yet to come.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   And so in
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   verse 28, he says, "And we know
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   in all things God works for the good
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800]   of those who love Him, who have been
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.800]   called according to His purpose."
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   My first point this evening is that God
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.800]   works the bad out for your good.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   God works the bad out for your good.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   Just hold on to that promise, okay?
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.800]   God works the bad out for
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   your good. That is what He does. That is a
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.800]   promise to you from the Scriptures. It says
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   this, we'll go section at a time, "We
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   know." This is a very matter
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   of fact for Christians. We know.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.800]   We have this knowledge. It is a
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   matter of fact to us. Like we know
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   that gravity pulls us down. That we
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   know the stars hang in the sky. That we know
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   the grass is green. We know that
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   God works all things
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   for the good of those who love Him, who have been called
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.800]   according to His purpose. If you are here, you
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800]   are a follower of Christ. This is a foundational
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.800]   truth to you. We know it.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   The Scripture says. Paul just talks about
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800]   it like it's a matter of fact.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.800]   What do we know? We know that God works in all
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   things.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.800]   Think about this. He hasn't just put
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   you here to flail
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   through life on your own. That you don't have help.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   But God, the Creator of the
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.800]   heavens and the earth. The one who spoke things
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.800]   into existence. The one who said
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   it was and it was good.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.800]   Is actively and intimately
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   involved
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   in your life right now. Involved in your
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.800]   relationships right now. Involved in your
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800]   work right now. He knows
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.800]   you. He knows everything about you.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   Where you've been and where you're going.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   He's at work.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   In all those things.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   Specifically
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   in your life.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.800]   And He's working it out
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   for your
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   good.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   So He's
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.800]   working it out for your good.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   This is an unbelievable
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   truth. And so here's what I'm telling you.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   If it doesn't seem
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   good, He's not done.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Because He's working it
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   out for your good.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   So if what you have is not good, God's not
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   finished.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   If it doesn't seem good, then He's not
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   done. Right? And so this is what
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   God is doing. And so I want to
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   differentiate this from everything
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   happens for a reason. That's the worldly version.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800]   Well, everything happens for a reason.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   That's also true.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   It's just not as hopeful. It's certainly
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   not as helpful.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.800]   Right? When my radio was stolen
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   out of my car, car broken
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   into, someone says, "Well, everything happens for a reason."
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   I'm like, "I know the reason.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.800]   They wanted my radio."
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   That's not helpful.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.800]   That gives me no hope. You're right.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   Everything happens for a reason. There's a dude who
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   wanted my radio. It's a nice radio. He took it.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   That was the reason. That's not helpful.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   This verse says, "No, Him
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.800]   taking your radio is working
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800]   out for your good."
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.800]   And you can believe that
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   as much as you can believe anything
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   in life.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   You can hold on to that truth. That's
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   unbelievable. And so,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   who's good? There's two conditions
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   on this statement.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Those who love God.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   And that's
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   the promise. It's for those who, it's not for
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   anybody. It's for those who love God and for those who
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   have been called according to His purpose.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   That God
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   didn't save you
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   so that you could kick up your feet and take life
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.800]   easy. He didn't save you so that
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   you can sulk in your sorrows. He didn't save
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   you so that you can sit in your home alone. God
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.800]   saved you for a purpose. It's why He didn't
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   save you and then call you home to glory
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   instantly. But He saved you and He left
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.800]   you there so that you would continue
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   to work out His purpose. Continue to walk
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   through the good works which He's prepared in advance
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   for you to walk in.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   That He's called you to a purpose. That your life
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   has purpose. And you've got to find that
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.800]   because, you know, where your city that you
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.800]   live in will tell you your purpose is this. Your work will
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   tell you that your purpose is this. Your mom and dad will tell you
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   that your purpose is this. And God says, "No, your purpose is this."
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   And you need to know, "I would trust God over
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   anybody else
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   what your purpose actually
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   is."
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.800]   And so this verse,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   it can come across as trite.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.800]   I'd be cautious to stick this
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800]   verse in front of someone who is
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.800]   suffering.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   It can feel like you're writing off their
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.800]   suffering. It can feel like you're not suffering
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.800]   with them. But I would not
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.800]   lose sight of the promise. And I would
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.800]   continue to offer this promise to
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   someone who is suffering. The promise behind
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   this verse that God is at work
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   in their suffering. Not to be
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   insensitive, but to help them.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   To remind them. To help them carry that
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   burden. To sit in the suffering
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.800]   with them and wait. Tell them to wait
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   so that we can see God's promise
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   come to fruition.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.800]   But I want to show you
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   what this verse does if we believe it. Because it
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   has unbelievable power
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   behind it.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   It really unlocks a lot
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   of other verses in the scripture. There's all
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   of these verses in the scripture that say that
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   we can have joy in suffering. Now the
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   world will never tell you that you can have
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   joy in suffering. That doesn't make sense to science.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   That doesn't make sense to the way that
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   the world is wired. That you can experience joy
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   in suffering. But Romans 8.28 unlocks
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   these verses. Verses
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   like Romans 5 verse 3.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   "Not only so, but we also glory
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   in our sufferings because we know that
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   suffering produces perseverance."
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   We can glory in our suffering. James 1 verse
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   2 and 3. "Consider it pure joy
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   my brothers and sisters whenever you face trials."
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   Who considers trials joy? James.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   Romans 8.28
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   will help you do that. 1 Peter
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   4 verse 13 says, "But rejoice
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   in as much as you participate in the
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.800]   sufferings of Christ
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   so that you may be overjoyed
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   when his glory is revealed."
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   Colossians 1 verse 24.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   "Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you."
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.800]   Hebrews 10 verse 34.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   "You suffered along with those
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   in prison and joyfully accepted
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.800]   the confiscation of your property."
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   My radio. "Because you knew
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   that you yourselves had better
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   and lasting possessions."
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   Do you see that
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   what it's saying is that your emotions,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   listen, that your emotions do not
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   have to be tied to your experiences.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   Life says that your emotions have to be tied
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.800]   to your experiences. Romans 8.28 says that
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   your emotions do not have to be tied to your experiences.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   Are you following me? That you can
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   experience a trial
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   and still
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   experience joy. So let me just
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   show you, okay, this is a picture of
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   two knobs. Picture like oven knobs
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   if you will. You see the little red arrow.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.800]   And so you can see there that
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   knob is pointed to trial
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   and that knob is pointed to sadness, right?
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   And so if I turn that knob, because it's connected
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   by a belt, this is just an imaginary
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   illustration, because it's connected to a belt
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   if I turn that knob slowly, the other
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   one's going to turn slowly. So that when I
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800]   experience fun, I'm also going
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   to experience joy. But when I
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   experience trials, then I'm going to
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   experience sadness. What Romans
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.800]   8.28 does guys is it
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.800]   takes that belt off.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   And it says that in trials
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.800]   there is a joy that believers
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   can have that comes from a future
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.800]   hope that you can experience
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   joy in trials because of what
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.800]   God promises you.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   Because you know something
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   better is coming. That's the promise
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.800]   of this verse. That whenever
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   you are in trials, you can experience
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.800]   joy because you know that God is
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   working that trial out for your good.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   You know it. As a matter of fact,
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   you know it. For certainty
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   you know it.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   I've seen this demonstrated through the years.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.800]   Lots of examples.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   I'll give you one. In my own
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   personal life, when I
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   I guess
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   I was just about to get married
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   to Monica. It was one month
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800]   before our wedding.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.800]   I was sitting at my desk at AT&T
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.800]   and my phone
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   rang and it was my mom.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.800]   She said, "Jonathan?"
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   I said, "Yes." And then she said three
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   words you never want to hear someone you love
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   say. See I thought she was just calling to catch up.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   How's the wedding planning going? What's going on?
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800]   How's work? But you know we were just talking
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   like normal. She says, "Jonathan,
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   I have cancer.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   I need
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   to start chemotherapy right away."
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.800]   Now cancer was like this
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   thing to me that other people had
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   and people died from and no one
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   close to me had ever had cancer. Now my mom
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   is on the other end of this phone saying that
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   she has cancer and my whole
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   world has fallen apart but hers isn't.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   She says, "Don't
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   worry. My hair will
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   grow back before the wedding.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   And besides,
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   I think wig shopping would be kind of fun."
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   I'm like, "Mom, what are you?"
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   I'm like angry at her. I'm like, "What are you talking about?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   You've got cancer."
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   She says, "Hey, God's at work in this."
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   She held fast to the
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   truth of this verse.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   My dad says about her that she has more
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   faith than sense.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   But she clung, she
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   clung to the promises of
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   God here, right? She knows
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.800]   that God has a plan in this and so
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   she's showing me this,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   right? I want to be really
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   careful here. I don't know where you're at. If you're
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   in a trial, I'm not even talking to you right now.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   I'm talking to those of you
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   who just want to look
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   at the theology behind this passage. This is a theological
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   statement, not a pastoral statement.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   Let me just say this.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   I think
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   you can say things one
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   to many that you wouldn't say one on
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   one.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   It's this. In certain
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   circumstances, I should say. Because
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   I would be kind and compassionate and
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.800]   shepherd those people.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   Is your
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   cancer the result
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   of your lack of faith?
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   No.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   That would be a heresy.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.800]   But your discouragement
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   might be.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   But your
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   discouragement, your despair
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   in your experience
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   may be the result
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   of a lack of faith. Now I'm not saying you can't
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   experience sadness. I'm not saying
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   that you can't be upset at the trial.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   I'm not saying that you can't be angry
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   that the world that we live in has fallen
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   because sin has come into the world. We know that
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   Jesus looked at the grave of his friend Lazarus
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   and he wept.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.800]   We find hope that Jesus experienced
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   and displayed those emotions.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   So we can be compassionate. We can weep
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   with our friends. We can mourn with
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   those who mourn and rejoice with those
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   who rejoice. Suffer with those who
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   suffer.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   But
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   you cannot
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   doubt God's goodness.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   And I would encourage you
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   not to stop believing
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   that God is at work in your circumstance
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   for your good.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   And this is the hope that Paul held
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.800]   onto and why he had
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   the power to say
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.800]   things like these light
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   and momentary troubles.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   So that's kind of
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   the punchline. Now how do we get there?
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   That's the solution to the problem
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   but we don't really know how we got
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   to that solution. So what is the good
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   that God is at work in? Because it's a
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   very specific good. It's not a general good.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   Let me show you now from the scriptures.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.800]   Verse 29 it says, "For those God
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.800]   foreknew." That "for" there means "because."
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   Think "because." Because
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   I'm telling you God is working this out
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   for your good, for those who love him,
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   those who have been called according to his purpose.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   "Because those God foreknew,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.800]   he also predestined to be conformed
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.800]   to the image of his Son." Ding, ding, ding,
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   ding, ding. Here's the good.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   "That he might be the firstborn
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   from among many brothers and
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.800]   sisters."
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   And so God has started something
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   since the beginning
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   that he's going to carry out in you. And so my second
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   point is this. It's this good,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   the good that we're talking about in Romans
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   8-28. This good is
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   God's end goal for you.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   This good is something very specific
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   and the very specific good thing
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   that God is working out in your life
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   is his end goal for you
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   that you would be conformed to the image
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   and the character of his Son
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   Jesus Christ for all eternity.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   You're being made into something
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   that you were being made into
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   since the beginning of time.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   So this is not a
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   "I lost my job." That's okay.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   "God has a better job for me."
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   #Romans8-28
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   That's not what's going on here.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   That's not what this verse teaches.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.800]   This is a
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.800]   "I lost my job." It's okay.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   God is conforming
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   me to the image of Christ through this
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   circumstance and he has set up for me
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   an eternal glory. And a hundred
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   years from now, it won't matter
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   that I lost my job. A billion
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   years from now, it won't matter that I lost
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   my job. I will not be in heaven
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   10,000 years from now
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   sulking because I lost my job.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   I know it's going to be okay because
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   God has set up for me an eternal glory,
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   eternal riches with him in his
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   presence forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   and ever and ever and ever.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800]   And that's the hope I cling to as I sit here
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   frustrated
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   that this didn't
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   go as I wanted, but hopeful
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   and even joyful.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   And even joyful.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   And so let's define some terms.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   Those he foreknew.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   Now I want to confess to you that for a number
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.800]   of years when I came into the faith, I read
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   this foreknowledge as like God knowing
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   what was going to happen in the future. Maybe some of you
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   thought that's what this is.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.800]   This he foreknew, this means that God knows
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   what's going to happen. That's not what this foreknew means.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   This is a he foreknew you.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.800]   He
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   before creation looked
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   ahead and existed in relationship
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.800]   with you before you ever were.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   In his mind, you were his.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   He knew you like he
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   knew Israel in Amos 3 verse 2.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   Like he knew Israel before
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   or among all of the nations, he knew
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   Israel as his in the same way
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   before you were created, before your mama
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.800]   was created, before your parents ever
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   lived and your grandparents ever lived and before
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   he shaped the earth.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   He knew you like he knows
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.800]   you today.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   He foreknew
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   you.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   See, God doesn't
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   exist in a chronological timeline.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   We exist
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   in Monday, porch
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   day, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   God
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   stands outside of that chronology
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   and he just sees
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   the end result. He sees it like a
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   painting, candidly. Not
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   like a movie, but like a picture, somehow.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   I can't even get my head around that.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   It says those he
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   foreknew, he also predestined. Lots of debate
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   around this verse, so I really want to explain to you what it
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   means, predestined.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   What this word here, predestined
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   means, is it means
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   predestined.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   Destined ahead
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   of time, if you would rather that.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.800]   It means
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   determined beforehand.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   Don't be
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   so concerned
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   that God
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   is in control.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   Don't be so confused or concerned
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   that, "Well, wait a minute, but I can't understand that."
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.800]   Good. Do you want a fathomable God?
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800]   I want an unfathomable God.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   I think we would all say, "No, I want an unfathomable
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   God. God is unfathomable." But I hate that he's unfathomable.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   I wish he was fathomable.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   No, "But God is
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.800]   so big and sovereign and huge,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   but I wish he fit in my little box
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   nice and neat, so that I could completely
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   understand everything about him."
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   You don't want to worship a God you understand.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   Man,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   you don't even understand women, much less
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   God, right? I mean, you don't want to
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   worship a God that you don't understand.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   You don't want to worship a God that
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   you understand, right?
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.800]   God is God, right? He's
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   all-powerful. You don't know anything. There is
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   nothing else in this world
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   like him. And so here's
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   what I would tell you. If God is not sovereign, you are
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   not secure.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   Like, if you could do
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   anything to be saved, then you could
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.800]   certainly do something to lose your
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   salvation. If you are in control of your
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   salvation, you'll lose it. I
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   can't even keep up with my keys, much less
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   my salvation, right? And so I need God
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.800]   to be in complete control of that.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.800]   His sovereignty
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.800]   is the only force in this
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   universe strong enough to hold
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.800]   me secure
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   in heaven, in his kingdom, with him.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   It's the God who called you
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   at the beginning of time.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   That God you will not slip through
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   his fingers. That's meant to give you hope.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   And so what is the goal
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   that he's working towards? As I said, it's you
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800]   being conformed to the image of his
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   son. The good that he is
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   working out in your life is
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   you being made like Jesus, who is firstborn
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   over all creation. Firstborn means that
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   others are to come. His
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   brothers and sisters, that's you.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   That you have been adopted into his family.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   We said the other day that the entire Bible
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   is about God getting his children back,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   and I'll add to it tonight, and placing
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   Jesus as head over a new tribe
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   that belongs to God and was
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   always going to belong to God.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   That's
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   the story being written. God getting his kids
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.800]   back and putting Jesus over them
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   as the head, his siblings, the
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.800]   church, your
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   brothers and sisters.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   And so it raises the question,
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   "JP, what if I'm not predestined?"
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   I don't know.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   But, before
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   you lose hope, let me just offer you something.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   Consider where you're at tonight, on a Tuesday.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   When
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   your friends are having $2 margaritas
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   somewhere, and maybe you
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   stumbled into this place thinking it was a restaurant
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   and you hoped to get a good burger, and all of a sudden you find
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   yourself in church, and I just, "Hey, God's
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   in that. He's
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   after you."
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   And so, if you're here, and you're
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   Hindu, good luck.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   God's pursuing
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   you. If you're here, and you're atheist,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   I just got a feeling you're not going to
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   be atheist long.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   Because God is radically pursuing
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.800]   you. If you're here for all
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   the wrong reasons, you want to take
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   advantage of someone, you want to
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   pray on God's people, watch
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   out.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.800]   He's a huge God.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   And he's going to get you, and the way that
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   he's going to punish you is he's going to save you.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   And make you do his will for the
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   rest of your life. I mean, that's what he does, right?
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   It's amazing.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   That's how
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   he punished me. Praise God.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   And so,
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   you might be here,
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   "Well, what if my loved one is not predestined?
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   What if somebody I love very much is not predestined,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   JP, that keeps me up at night?"
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   But consider who's in their life.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   Consider who God
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   and his sovereignty placed
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   in their family tree, or next to them,
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.800]   or in a relationship with them,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   so that he might call
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   them into a relationship with him. He uses
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   those he's called.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   And it's beautiful.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   And so here's what this means, right?
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.800]   It means that when life
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   is hard, God is working towards
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   something, some end goal.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   You ever seen somebody that's like, really
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   out of shape, and they're like, "Man, 2016
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   is my year." And they go to the gym,
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   and they get a trainer, and they go all out, they get the
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   workout clothes, they go to Lululemon and spend
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   like $20,000, and then they go
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   to the gym, and they're just like, "I'm gonna go
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   big, I'm gonna do it right," you know, and they're there,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   and they're like, "Oh, it's so hard, I don't
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   wanna quit." They just constantly wanna quit, and they're out of
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   shape. And I've seen these people,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   I've been in a gym before, I know where it is.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800]   And so I've seen these people, right?
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.800]   And it's like, I've been
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   in those people, and so, and
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   they're just like, "Okay, I wanna give up, I wanna give up,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   I wanna give up." But something happens as they don't
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   give up, as they press through, they begin
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   to feel better. And they begin to
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   look better, and they begin to lose weight,
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   and begin to have more energy, they begin to reap the benefits.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   And all of a sudden, they're an addict, they're a gym rat,
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   "I'm not going anywhere, I'm in the gym," you know,
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   and they're just, they're loving it, they can't get enough
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   of the gym, because they, all of a sudden, they're like
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   the icon of health.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   And you're like, "How did this happen?" It's because
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.800]   they began to see the benefit.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   And the benefit
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   began to,
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   it became worth the cost.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   And that's what this verse is saying,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   it's saying, "Hey, here's the benefit."
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.800]   And so,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   in the trial, know that it's worth it.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   Press forward, because something
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   good is coming, something
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   good is coming for you, right?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   God, through every trial, He's sculpting
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   you, He's turning you to
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   something, so trust this truth in
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   trials, that God is
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   turning you into something.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   The best way I know how to illustrate this is the story
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   of Michael Angelo.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   He's a sculptor in the 1500s,
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.800]   and maybe his most famous work of all time
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   is the statue of David.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800]   Not David Marvin, but
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   David.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.800]   And,
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   he was asked
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   this question,
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   "How did you create such a beautiful monument?"
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   And listen to his amazing response.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   He said,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   "Just chip away the stone that doesn't
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   look like David. In every
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   block of marble I see a statue
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   as plain as though it stood before me,
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   shaped and perfect in attitude
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   and action. I have only to
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.800]   hew away the rough walls
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.800]   that imprison the lovely apparition
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   to reveal it to the other
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   eyes as mine see it."
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   And in your life,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   God is taking this statue
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.800]   called you, and chipping away
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   everything that does not look like Jesus,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   and it may not feel good
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.800]   as you get hit with a hammer,
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   and a chisel, and a spike, and
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   rocks are falling off, but
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   you are being mold and shaped into the
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   image of Jesus for eternity.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   And in a hundred years,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   two hundred years, two hundred
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   thousand years,
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   the pain won't even be a memory
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   that you carry.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   You will just be perfected
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.800]   like Christ in all your glory
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   for eternity,
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   and it will be worth it.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   See, God doesn't always
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800]   change your circumstance.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   His promise is to change you
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   in your circumstance.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   He doesn't always change
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800]   your circumstance. His promise is to change you
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   in your circumstance, and so if it's painful,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   hold on.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   If it doesn't feel good, hold fast
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   to the hope of glory.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Verse 30,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   "And those he predestined, he also
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   called, and those he called, he also
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   justified. Those he justified,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   he also glorified."
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   He glorified.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   The third and final point
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   is that the best is yet to come.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   The best is
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   yet to come. This progression
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   that Paul writes here to the church in Rome,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   it's very matter of fact.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   It is meant to offer you hope
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   and security that God doesn't miss anyone
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   that he's accounted for in the beginning.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   No one slips through the fingers
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   of God. Everyone
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   is accounted for. Everyone
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   that he predestined, he called,
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   and he called, he justified, he justified,
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   he glorified, that glorified
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   there. That's his end goal. That's
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   the good that he's working toward. That's you
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   in the character, or in the image rather,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   of Christ. And so let's just define
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   this. This word called, right, this
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   is not a...
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   Come here, Spot.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   Spot, come here.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   It's not that kind of called.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   It's like this. "Lazarus, come
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.800]   forth!"
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.800]   This call brings
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.800]   about the thing that it requests.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   This call,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   this word call, it brings
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   into reality the very request
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   that it makes. When Jesus says,
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   "Lazarus, come forth," Lazarus cannot
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   say no. He's
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   just coming. Against his will
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   he's coming. He's forth,
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   out of the grave, it's done. This is
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   the call here. It's not a
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   "Hey, come here and you might miss it." It's not
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   a phone ringing.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   It's something that your soul and your
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   body and your heart has to
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   obey. That sin
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   no longer has power
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   over you. And you walk
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   from that grave forward.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   This justified, this word
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   means declared righteous.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   It's a beautiful word.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   It happens in a moment that
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Jesus' righteousness is imputed
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   on you. That all of the
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   righteousness from his account is
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   accredited to your account.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   That you in a moment are
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   seen as righteous, even though you're an adulterer.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   Even though you had an abortion.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   Even though you're addicted to pornography.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.800]   Even though you're having sex with your significant
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   other. Even though you're getting drunk. Even though
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   you're legalistic. Even though you're self-righteous.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   You're justified.
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   You don't have to pay for that.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.800]   You don't
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   have to pay for that.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   You are no longer
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   under the penalty
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   of sin.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   And those who justified, he also
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   glorified. You know what's amazing about
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   this word? It's
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   past tense.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   But it hasn't happened yet.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   But it has. But it hasn't.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   But it has. God sits
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.800]   outside of time.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   He's not operating
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   in your chronological order.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   He sees you as glorified.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   Perfect.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   Like Jesus.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.800]   Pure and holy.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   Before himself.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.800]   Forever and ever and ever.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   That one day you would be somewhere
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   absent of the presence
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   of sin. This is the reality
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.800]   that Jesus on the cross, you remember what he said?
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   "To tell is died."
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   It is finished.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   What is finished, Jesus?
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   It's not finished. You haven't raised from the grave.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   What's finished? Your sin is
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   paid for. God in his wrath,
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   in his fullness, is satisfied
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.800]   on me. The bill is paid.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   Every image you've looked at. Everything
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.800]   you've done wrong. It's been paid
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   for to tell is died.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   But it ain't over.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.800]   The best is yet
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   to come. I'm going to
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   raise from the grave. This is the
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.800]   truth that we walk in. That it's finished.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.800]   My sins are paid for.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.800]   And the best is yet to come. This already
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   and not yet.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   Sins paid for and the reward
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   for those sins being paid
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   for in its fullness is
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   coming my way of glory.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800]   Praise God.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.800]   And so we're
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   free from the power of sin.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.800]   Free from the penalty of sin.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.800]   And one day
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   much sooner than we'll ever expect, we're
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   free from the presence of sin forever
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   and ever and ever. This perspective
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   is so powerful.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   Perspective is powerful.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   That eternity with God,
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   the perfect, awaits you
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   my friend. It awaits you my friend.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   You're here on a Tuesday. I know your whole life's in front
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   of you. Maybe you've got 20, 30 years. Maybe 40
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   years. And eternity
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.800]   in glory with the Father awaits
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   you. And so you can see your cancer.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   You can see your sickness.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   Your hurt. Your breakup. You can see it
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   through that lens.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   I mean as we look back, like let me
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   tell you something man. In the 6th grade,
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   oh man, in the 6th grade,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   I was dating Ann Marie. Let me
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   just start here. No one
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800]   should be dating anybody in the 6th grade.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   Okay?
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   It's stupid. But I
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   was. And
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   Ann Marie, I loved her.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   I wanted to marry Ann Marie
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   and she dropped
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   me like a bad habit in front of everybody
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   man. I mean I'm talking just like
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   looked at me in front of all my friends and just
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   said hey it's over. No reason, no
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.800]   excuse. I mean she liked somebody else. But I
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   was there and I was, I like
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   couldn't get myself together.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   I remember walking to the bathroom
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   and wishing it had a lock on the door because
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   I was like snot crying, like
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   ugly crying in the mirror. I remember like looking
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   at myself in the mirror at my
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   little school and said what is wrong
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   with you that Ann Marie doesn't like you anymore?
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   And I'm embarrassed to tell you this part.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   But I remember,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   I remember hitting my
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   head against the wall.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   Thinking that life as I knew it
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   was over. And that anybody
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   that would come after Ann Marie would just be
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   a significant step down.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   (Laughter)
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   And you laugh.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.800]   But the
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   pain to me was very real.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.800]   Now if I was talking about a miscarriage
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   my hunch
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.800]   is you wouldn't laugh.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   If I was talking about being laid
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   off yesterday you might not laugh. If I was talking
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   about man I just got diagnosed with cancer
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   you probably wouldn't laugh.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   But can I tell you something crazy?
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   The pain that I felt in the 6th grade
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   was just as real to me
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   than any of those things.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.800]   And the only thing that makes it silly
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   is perspective.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   Like I'm removed from it by time
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.800]   now I'm married to Monica.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   Upgrade!
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   (Laughter)
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   Just kidding Ann Marie you're great. Made in the image of God.
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   (Laughter)
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   But upgrade.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.800]   And
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.800]   so I'm removed from that situation. I look back
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   and it's silly now. We can laugh about it.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   It's funny and I'm not trying to be insensitive
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   but I'm just telling you 100 years
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   from now you're going to feel similar
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   about your trials.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   I really am. I'm just speaking
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   from a theological truth of a verse
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   and I'm not trying to upset you or frustrate
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.800]   you. I'm just telling you
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   that glory
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   is coming.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   And you can have hope
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.800]   in the midst of that.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   And so if it seems like an ugly
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   painting,
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   wait for it.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   Hold on.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   Because you are watching the most amazing
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   artist I know.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   He makes all things
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   beautiful.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   Wait for it. You can believe that.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.800]   Take it to the bank.
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   So in summary, God's work
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   God works the bad out for your good.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   God's good is his end goal for you.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   Christ's glory
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   and the best is yet to come for those who love Him
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   who have been called according to His purpose.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   Sunday night
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   sitting on
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   the bed, my little girl
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   and
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   Presley, the girl's
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   share room.
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   Presley says,
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   "Daddy, I want to become a Christian."
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   We've had these conversations
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   before. I've
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   asked her diagnostic questions before.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   I'm like, "Presley, between 1 and 10,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   how certain are you that if you die today that you go to
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   heaven?" She's like, "9.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   9.5."
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   Something was
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   different Sunday.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   She looked at me and
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   she said, "10."
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   I'm like, "Okay, she might have learned
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   the answer, so why?"
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   She just answered so differently. She said,
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   "Because..."
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   She said, "Daddy, not because of anything I've done."
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   She said, "But because of what Jesus
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   has done for me, that He died
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   for my sins and God raised
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   Him from the dead."
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   What a beautiful truth. I said, "Presley,
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   would you like
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   to pray?"
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   She said, "Yeah."
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   I said, "Let
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   God know that
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   you've done a lot of
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   things, that you've sinned against Him."
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   She said, "God, I've sinned against
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   You. I know I've sinned
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.800]   against You." She thanked
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   Him for Jesus and His payment for
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   her sins.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   She thanked Him. She thanked God
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   that He has the power to raise Jesus from the
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   grave.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   She asked God, "Would
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.800]   You come and live in my life? Would
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   You send Your Spirit
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   to guide me?" It was the most beautiful,
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   articulate, Gospel-centered prayer that a
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   nine-year-old could pray.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   She said, "Amen."
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   I said, "Presley,
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   you're a Christian."
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   I said, "Presley, we're going to spend
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   forever and ever
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   and ever together in Heaven.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.800]   We're going to be there in God's glory, together
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   forever and ever. We get to be there
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   forever."
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   She started crying.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   I said, "Why are you sad?"
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   She said, "No, Daddy. These are happy tears.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   These are happy
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   tears."
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   I said, "Presley, this is what this means.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   That now
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   that you've been called according to His
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   purpose. That whatever
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   circumstance life throws
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   at you, you know that you can
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   get through because God is working it
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   out for your good. You're going to be with
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   Him forever and ever and
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   ever. So just hold on because
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   much sooner than you think this world
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   won't matter as much as everyone's going
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   to try to convince you that it does,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   God is saying He's doing
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   something bigger than it.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   In your circumstance, Presley,
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   hold on. Let me tell you something.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   As a dad who loves her very much,
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   I know what's coming her way.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.800]   I know heartbreak is coming
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.800]   her way. I know that at some
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   time in the future when she's 30
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.800]   that some idiot is
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.800]   going to hurt her and I'm going to
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.800]   want to hurt him. I know that's
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   coming her way.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   Layoffs.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   God forbid, sickness,
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.800]   maybe cancer,
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   carriages.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.800]   She's going to face these types
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.800]   of things, maybe bigger. She's going
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   to lose loved ones. She's
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   going to lose her parents. She's going to put her
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   daddy in the grave one day.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:07.800]   And let me tell you something.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.800]   This daddy can't fix those
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   things.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   I can't make them good.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.800]   But that daddy can.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   And that daddy will.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   He promised.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   He promised
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   that he would.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   How incredible is that?
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   And friends, what I'm telling you is
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.800]   he made you the exact same promise.
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   And so when you wake up
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   tomorrow and you're
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   looking at an ugly painting,
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   friends, you hold on.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   God ain't done yet.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   The best is yet to come.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   And he's
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   going to turn it around. He's going to turn it for your
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   good. That's what he does.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   He's always done that.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   There was a painting one day of an ugly
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.800]   dead
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   man on a cross.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   And the enemy
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   was doing the happy dance.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.800]   He thought it was over.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   And God
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   flipped the script.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   And he made it
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.800]   an empty tomb.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   He made a salvation for all who
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.800]   believe.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.800]   He's really good at that.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   He's really,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.800]   really good at that. Let me praise him.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800]   Let me thank him now.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:33.800]   Father, you make
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   everything beautiful.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   Thank you
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   for the hope
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   that you've given us in this
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.800]   passage, for the
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   truth that you've placed
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   in here for us to cling to, to hold
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   on to,
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   for the realities of Romans
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   828,
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   the truths of Romans
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   829, and the promise of Romans
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   830,
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   that we will be in glory
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   with you forever and ever and
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.800]   ever and ever and ever and ever.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   Oh, God.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   You're
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   a great dad.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   And I know
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   that we're going to be tempted to lose
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   sight of this very soon. And so,
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   would you and your sovereignty, by the power
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   of your spirit at work in our lives, would you just
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.800]   remind us, please?
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.800]   And would you help us to
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   believe it? Would you help
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.800]   us to live it?
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   I know that some of you are here
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.800]   tonight, and
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.800]   that promise is not for you,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   at least not yet.
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.800]   You
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   don't love God. You haven't yet
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   been called according to His purpose
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   in the chronological timeline
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   that we live in.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   And I'm
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.800]   confident,
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   if I may say, that
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   He's calling you.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   And I hope that
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   you would consider giving
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   your life to Him, that you would be
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.800]   a new creation, that you would change
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   the way that you live, really,
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.800]   that He would come in your life and begin to change
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.800]   the way that you live, making
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   you, chipping away
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   in your life that which does not look
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.800]   like Jesus. And you know if that's you.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   You know if that's where you're at. There's going to be
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   a team of folks up here that would love
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.800]   to talk to you. And if you're here and you're
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.800]   asking the question, "Well, how do I know? How can I
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.800]   trust God? How do I know that He's going
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   to make it good?" He's
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   showed us.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   He's shown us that the
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   worst day in history
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   we would call Good
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   Friday.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   Because He paid for our sins there.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   Because He set us free there
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.800]   2,000 years
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.800]   ago. Set us
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   free.
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.800]   And so we would love to talk with you about that
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.800]   if that's where you're at. We would love
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   to wrestle with you. This is
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.800]   a great, safe place
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   for you to ask any questions that you have.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.800]   And if you're sitting in your
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   life staring at an ugly
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.800]   painting, hold on.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   Wait for it.
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.800]   The best is yet to come.
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   It ain't over yet.
