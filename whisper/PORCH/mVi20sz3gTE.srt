00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
 Good evening and welcome to the porch.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,500
 I'm here to guide you on your journey through the complex world of relationships.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 Can we cue some music please?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 From our friendships to our romantic endeavors,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
 we'll explore our family bonds, estranged relationships,

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
 work dynamics, and perhaps even the relationship with oneself.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
 So how do we relate?

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,000
 To answer this, we'll look to scripture and find exactly what God has to say about our relationships.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 This is, after all, the Relationship Series.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Porch, how we doing? We doing okay?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Great to see you.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Man, you know, if I could express the same sentiment in return,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 with that sort of enthusiasm, I would.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's so good to see you.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm so glad that y'all would join us here this evening.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Not just those of you here in the room, of course we're glad to see you,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 but also all of you that are tuning in with us online.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Porch Live Nation, everywhere you are, we're so glad that you're here with us this evening.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,500
 I've said it before, I'll say it again, and you'll hear it at some point in the future.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 We believe that God can meet with any person at any time and in any place, and that includes you.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,000
 So thanks so much for being a part of it.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Special shout out to Porch Live, Tulsa, Boise, and Indy.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So grateful for what God is doing there.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Well, it was eighth grade when I experienced my first official year of basketball tryouts.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Anybody play basketball in here?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Grade school, high school?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 All right.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 For the first time in mine and my peers' lives, not everyone would make a team and be slotted to play,

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 but only those that were talented enough to make the roster.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And listen, okay, those of you that cheered, I'm not delusional.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 You know, at the time, I knew that I wasn't the best guy on the court.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Like, I wasn't the star-studded playmaker.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I wasn't the bona fide starter to the team.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Just to be frank, like, I genuinely deserved to ride the pine.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Like, that's just kind of the level of my ability at the time.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 But what I wanted was to make the team.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Like, I loved the sport.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 I desperately wanted to make my way on, and I decided to game the system.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And so I asked a good friend of mine who was a year older than I was,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 "Hey, when you tried out for the team a year ago, what did y'all do?

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Like, what did tryouts look like?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And that way I can learn what to do, so that way I can make sure to get on the team."

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 He told me they did three things.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 They did something called the "mic and drill,"

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 which is where you're standing underneath a hoop,

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 and you work your right hand and left hand.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 You just put the ball into the basket.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Left-handed and right-handed layups, which I had no experience with left-handed layups,

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 so I had to learn how to use my left hand very quickly.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And then lastly were shots from the elbow.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And so I learned the three things that I was supposed to do.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 He told me what I needed to know, and I'll just cut to the chase.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Like, I became a master at all three of these things.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And so the day of tryouts come, and I crushed it.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Like, I don't think I missed a single shot.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I made every single layup.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I looked like a savant with my left hand.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And because I did, to my coach's surprise and my own, I made the A-team.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Yeah, man.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 [applause]

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Everything was going incredible.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 That is until the season began, and we started playing real games.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 You see, it didn't take long for my coaches to realize that I wasn't all that I appeared the day that I showed up to tryouts.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 That although I knew what to do in tryouts,

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I didn't know how to actually play the game in the heat of real competition.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I was exposed.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And I suffered the consequences of that exposure.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I was unceremoniously demoted from the A-team to the B-team.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And then I was demoted from the B-team to the C-team.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Now, why do I tell you that?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Because in life, we often want someone to just tell us what to do.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And we minimize the importance of learning how to play the game.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 In no area of life is this truer than in the area of work.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 You see, just like me asking for the secrets to crack the code on tryouts,

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 we often want someone to help us crack the code on what we need to do so we can be successful

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 and actuate our potential and achieve our dreams and make some kind of difference and leave a mark on the world.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And if you look at the data, it actually backs this up.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Like, Deloitte recently did a report in 2024 that said millennials in Gen Z in the workplace

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 are mostly driven by a purpose-driven mentality, that we want purpose-driven work.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And this is, by and large, for every one of us in here, this is what we desire.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Just under 90% of young adults agreed, "I want purpose in my job.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I don't want to just be performance-oriented. I want to be purpose-oriented,"

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 which isn't a bad thing.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Like, I actually think that that's a good thing.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 If you read the Bible, it's actually even more so. It's a God thing.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Because if you're a follower of Jesus, what you often consider when you think about your work

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 is that God does have purpose for you wherever it is you spend your time, 9 to 5, Monday to Friday.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And what you probably think if you're a follower of Jesus is that your purpose on the job is to fulfill the Great Commission.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 It's to make disciples of every cubicle.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 You know, like, that's kind of your mentality, which is spot on and correct.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And yet, I would say, though it is correct, it's actually not complete.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Because we not only have one mandate for our work, we have two.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 You see, God, He does care about the people that you work around.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 But He also cares about the work you do.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Because in the very first chapter of the Bible, He tells us that we should rule over all the earth.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 That as His viceroy, His image bearers, those made in the image of God, we should go and subdue the earth.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 That we should cultivate culture, and we should build structure, and we should produce beauty.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Like, it's good that you want a job that's filled with purpose.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 But God's looking at you and He's saying, "Hey, I've already filled your job with purpose. You need look no further."

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 That's why, whether you're a teacher, or an IT guy, or an attorney, or an accountant, or a plumber, or a carpenter, or a construction worker,

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 you can be convinced that in God's eyes, it matters far less what you do, and much more how you do it.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 So then, how are we supposed to work?

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Well, that's what I want to talk to you about tonight.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And to do so, we're going to be in the book of Ephesians.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 If you have a Bible, you can grab it. Turn to Ephesians chapter 6.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 If you don't have a scripture, that's okay. We'll have all the text up on the screens for you.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 But here's what I want to do. I just want to walk us through a passage of scripture

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 where the apostle Paul is going to help some subordinates learn how to honor their masters.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 By this point in the book of Ephesians, what you need to know is that he has already unpacked this idea of a divine and radical grace of God.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 That any person, Jew and Gentile, can place their faith in Jesus, and they can be forgiven of their sins in a moment.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 That you can have salvation by simply professing him as Lord.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 That it was dark for you. You were facing a difficult day.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 You had no hope on your own, and yet Jesus stepped into your story.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And he saved you, but he didn't just save you by yourself.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 He saved you into his family.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Because as you keep reading, you see that Paul talks about not just the purpose you live for, but also the unity of the body.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Which is what we find as we come through chapters 5 and 6.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 He talks about parents and children and husbands and wives.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And as we come to the section we're in tonight, he's going to talk about masters and bond servants.

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It says this, Ephesians 6 verse 5.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Okay, let's park this for a second.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Anybody in here have a different translation that doesn't say bond servant?

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Yeah, what's it say?

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Slavery.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Which for some of us, if we read that, immediately we get hung up on.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And there's good reason for that, because that word is loaded with so much historical context.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Even personal context for many of us.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So it's important for us to clarify.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Is Paul condoning slavery?

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 No. Far from it.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 In fact, if you study through chapters 5 and 6, you will see these other relational constructs that God has ordained.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And what you see is you look at the way husbands relate to wives and parents relate to children.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 As you see that Paul references in each a creational order to things.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 He takes it back to God's original design as he unpacks those two different relationship structures.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 He does not reference a creational order when he is talking about bond servitude.

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 What does that all mean?

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 This was never a part of God's design.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 Slavery was never a part of God's plan.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It was not something he schemed up and then unleashed on the world.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 It's far from within his realm of reason.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Now, I don't have time to unpack what slavery looked like in the first century.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Nor give you a dissertation of the differences between it and what we see in the 1800s, 1900s, and then in human trafficking today.

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 But what I will say very briefly, just to give us some handles to hold, is that this looked very different than what we understand as modern slavery.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 You see, in the Roman Empire, many slaves, not all, but many of them, they would enter into bond servitude voluntarily.

145
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Whether through debt bondage, where I had money I owed and so I would choose to enter into an agreement where I could work my way out of debt.

146
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Or through a process they called self-selling, where I would sell myself into your servitude.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 That way I could ascend up the social ladder.

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I could find my way into Roman citizenship.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I could avail myself to new opportunity.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I could eventually get free of the Roman tax system.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 What you see is that many people would enter into bond servitude by way of their own self-selection.

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 They would choose to do so.

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Now, this isn't a comprehensive explanation of what you see bond servitude is in the Roman Empire.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 But it is important for us to understand because it is contextually relevant to why we're talking about work from this passage in specific.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'm not defending bond servitude.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Again, we can talk about it through a podcast or something different at another time.

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 If you have questions, you can come and visit with me about it.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 This is not a raving endorsement for it.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Are you all clear on that?

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But what we do need to know is it has some similarities to an employer-employee relationship.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 It's, when agreed upon, mutually beneficial for both parties, according to what we see in this text.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 There is a definitive end date.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It's not something that perpetually goes on and on and on.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 It will eventually end.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 What you see is that both report to an authority and they're contractual.

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So Paul's instruction for them is a useful instruction for us.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Because he talks to them, he knows that many of these people, they serve in jobs of medicine or accounting or business or philosophy or civil service, even the emperor's own household.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 They're in positions that would look really similar to some of the positions that we're working in here tonight.

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And so he's going to instruct them on what it looks like for them to interact in their relationship.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And it's helpful for us because we need to know how to interact with other people in our working relationship.

171
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So what does he say?

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 What's the way to work?

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Well, it tells us, starting in verse 5, we'll read it again.

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 It says, "Bond servants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ."

175
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He gives them the command to obey, which if you study in the Greek just means to come under the authority of someone else.

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 That I am positionally subordinate to someone.

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And the way that I'm supposed to engage with them is fear and trembling.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 What does that mean?

179
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Does it mean that you should be nervous and anxious at the fact that your boss is reigning and ruling over the top of you?

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 No, that's not what you should feel.

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 When you see those words combined throughout the scripture, it always is pointing to a mentality of reverence or respect.

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Which brings us to our first point, that we respect those we work with, even if they don't deserve it.

183
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 We respect those we work with, even if they don't deserve it.

184
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 You see, you shouldn't be afraid, nor should you tremble at the sight of your boss.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 You should respect them though.

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 So think about it like this.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 If Michael Jordan walked on to the court of your local LA Fitness,

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 there's not a soul in here that would be like, "Mike! What's up, dude?"

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And then casually go about their business.

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 No one would do that.

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 No. It would demand some kind of response.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 You would start to feel your heart beating really fast in your chest, and your palms begin to get really sweaty,

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 and your voice starts to get really high-pitched because you've never talked to someone of this sort of caliber.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 You see, because he is an authority in that domain, you don't just recognize him.

195
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 You respond to him.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 You put some respect on his name, because he's earned it.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Because he is the greatest, whether you disagree or not.

198
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 It's important to point out here that Paul doesn't say anything about your boss, or manager, or supervisor deserving your respect.

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 It can be a really hard pill for some of us to swallow.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Like some of you, you're sitting under the supervision of someone that--

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Man, they belittle the people that work for them.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 They speak demeaning to those that report up.

203
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 They take credit when they actually didn't do the work.

204
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 You have people that you report to, that you look at, and you're like, "Man, they don't deserve my respect whatsoever."

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And yet Paul's saying, "No, that's not the problem."

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Because according to Paul, we know that they're still deserving our respect.

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Peter says this in 1 Peter 2:18, he says, "Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and to the gentle, but also to the unjust."

208
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 I remember one of my really good friends reported to a boss that was the epitome of evil.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And to top it off, they claimed to be a believer.

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But this was the type of boss that would bang tables and throw papers and get crazy eyes whenever something would go wrong.

211
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And yet what I saw my friend do as they engaged with their boss is I saw they did not indulge the temptation of their coworkers.

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Where everybody was standing around the water cooler and plotting a coup, how to overthrow this evil dictator, they wouldn't do so.

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 They decided instead to show respect, even when respect wasn't deserved.

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And the thing that was crazy for me is this friend of mine, they were the subject of this person's greatest animosity.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And yet they chose to consistently and persistently honor them.

216
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 You see, this friend of mine, she respected the Lord's lead in her life.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And so she respected the leader over her life.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 She knew that God was the one calling the shots.

219
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Daniel chapter 2, it says this, "Blessed be the name of God forever and ever to whom belong wisdom and might."

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Catch this, he changes times and seasons.

221
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 He removes kings and he sets up kings.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.

223
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 What is Daniel saying? God is the only one in control.

224
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 So let me ask you, are you working like you believe that is true?

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Like, are you working like you actually believe God is in control?

226
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Or better yet, are you working in such a way that other people might believe that he's in control?

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 That he's the one calling the shots? That you're so willing to walk with a kind of humility and servant heartedness?

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That as things do go haywire and decisions do go sideways and you become the subject of someone's scrutiny,

229
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 you continue to find that man, you're unshaken, you're immovable, you're a constant fixture of faithfulness.

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Is that true of you and your story?

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Because that's going to lead people to believe something about the authority over your life.

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Not just the visible authority, but the invisible authority in your life.

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You see, if you don't respect the visible authority, they're not going to respect the invisible authority in your world.

234
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 They're not going to believe in him.

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Your witness depends on this. It's critical.

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 You see, people won't want to believe in Jesus if you don't work like you believe in Jesus.

237
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 That's why when everyone else is gossiping in the break room, you don't hop in there,

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 throw in your two cents, make sure that they hear that you agree,

239
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 that you deserve to be sympathized with because of the hardships you faced.

240
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 No, you choose to walk the other direction.

241
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 That's why whenever you find a man, your boss comes down hard on you,

242
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 like they're delivering harsh criticism, you don't get defensive, you don't bow up.

243
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 How dare you? You don't just respond and retaliate.

244
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Instead, you choose to listen to the things they say, respond with great grace, and then seek to be better.

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Or when your boss makes a really bad call or a decision becomes disastrous,

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 you don't choose to relish in their failure.

247
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Serves you right.

248
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 You don't celebrate their defeat.

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 You offer to help.

250
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 You seek to support even when others may not be willing to themselves.

251
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Now listen, does that mean that if you're in a tough work environment, you should just stay there?

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 I don't know.

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Maybe.

254
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Maybe not.

255
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 But what I do know is that God is the one in control of your story.

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 You can rely on him.

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Like you continue where you are until he makes clear you should go somewhere else.

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 You be steadfast in your work.

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 You be respectful to your boss.

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 You continue to pray and ask God for his guidance.

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 He will lead you where he wants you.

262
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 And here's the thing, Porch, many of us want desperately to be out of where we are.

263
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 When God has put you there on purpose and he's waiting for you to fulfill that purpose before he moves you elsewhere.

264
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Have you considered it?

265
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Or are you just so unsettled?

266
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 This is horrible.

267
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I can't believe this is my reality.

268
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 My circumstances could not get worse.

269
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Or have you registered to the fact that, man, God, you probably have me here for a reason.

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I should probably stand where my feet are set.

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 I should probably be ambitious about today and leave you entrusted with tomorrow.

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 What is it, God, that you want from me right now?

273
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Let me be diligent to accomplish whatever that is.

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 This is the first way that we work.

275
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The way we work matters and our work should be marked with respect for others even when they don't deserve it.

276
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 The second way we work is seen in verse 5.

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Again, it says bond servants obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling.

278
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And then it says with a sincere heart.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 That's the second thing as you would Christ.

280
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You see, the second thing that Paul tells us is that we give our best at work even when we don't feel like it.

281
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 We give our best at work even when we don't feel like it.

282
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 That word sincere means single.

283
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Which means that you work with a singleness of heart.

284
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That you don't have a job over here, but you really want a job over there.

285
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Because that would be a divided affection.

286
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 That would be a divided heart.

287
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 That's not how we work.

288
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 We work with a singularity of affection.

289
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 All of our being is pointed and all of our feeling is pointed at what God has given.

290
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 We work where we are.

291
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 We work wherever God wills.

292
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Why is that?

293
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Because we can trust him.

294
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Romans 8 tells us that God works all things together for the good of those that are called according to his purposes.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Which can be a really tough pill to swallow.

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Can we just level with each other?

297
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Like some of you are in here and you hear that.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Like man, God works for my good.

299
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And he's purposed it.

300
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Yet despite the fact that it's so miserable.

301
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Like that doesn't make any sense, Kyle.

302
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And like my job couldn't be any worse.

303
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 How is it that God could put me in such a horrible situation and yet he could stand on the promise that this is actually for my good.

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 That this is according to his plan and purpose.

305
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 How is that true?

306
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Well, I will just tell you this.

307
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 If that's you in the room, you're in really good company.

308
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Because the Bible is filled with people who could agree to that set of circumstances.

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 That was their reality.

310
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Just think about it.

311
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Daniel had a horrible boss in King Nebuchadnezzar.

312
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Joseph was abused repeatedly by people in power over him.

313
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And David was hunted down by the guy he was supposed to succeed.

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And yet what you find is that as these brothers continued to trust the Lord and do the best they could with where they were.

315
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 God provided for them.

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He even promoted them.

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Like Daniel, he becomes the ruler over the entire province of Babylon.

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 He even becomes the chief over Nebuchadnezzar's wise men.

319
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Joseph, who we talked about last week, you see he becomes the CFO over Egypt.

320
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And David is the king over all Israel.

321
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Now, that does not necessarily mean that if I trust God and I work hard, I'm going to be promoted into sea level status.

322
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 No, that's not what this is saying.

323
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 That's not what these examples are pointing towards.

324
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 But what it is saying is that he will take care of you.

325
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He'll provide for you.

326
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Which some of you need to hear because you're so desperately trying to provide for yourself.

327
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And yet you just need to know in the face of your hardship, in the face of your difficulty, as people use you and abuse you.

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And they wring you for all your worth, but they never give you anything in return.

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 You need to know God sees you.

330
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And he's at work in the waiting.

331
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 He has a plan.

332
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 He will bring it to pass because he works for your good.

333
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Proverbs 16.3 says, commit your work to the Lord and your plans will be established.

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Do you hear the promise in that?

335
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 You commit your work to the Lord and your plans will be established.

336
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 God will take care of you.

337
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 He loves to use those that work hard.

338
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 That give their best effort.

339
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 They try when other people wouldn't.

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 So that's why we as the people of God, we're not one foot in and one foot out.

341
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 We're best foot forward.

342
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Like we're giving everything we have to wherever God has us.

343
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 We don't just pass the time until 5 o'clock hits and praise God, happy hour somewhere and now I can finally go to the gym.

344
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 That's not our mentality.

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 No, we're making the most of the time we have.

346
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Like we don't grumble and complain when we're asked to do something meaningless.

347
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 This is the worst.

348
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 They always ask me to do this.

349
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I wish I didn't have to do these things that they perpetually and consistently ask.

350
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 No, that's not our response.

351
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 We find meaning in the mundane.

352
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 That's the people of God's response.

353
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Why?

354
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Why do we do this?

355
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 How is it that we can have such a radically reoriented perspective from the rest of the world?

356
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 The world doesn't do this.

357
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 They don't respond like this.

358
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 How can we do it?

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 That's not our reality because we're not bond servants to any man.

360
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 We're bond servants to Christ.

361
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 We're bond servants of Christ.

362
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 That's what Paul says in verse 6.

363
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 He says we don't do these things by way of eye service as people pleases but as bond servants of Christ Jesus doing the will of God from the heart.

364
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 That word for eye service is really funny.

365
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Paul probably made it up.

366
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 He's trying to communicate to us that we don't just work hard when other people are watching.

367
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Like you don't give your best effort whenever your boss is around.

368
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 That's not the mentality.

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 No, we work when no one is watching.

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 We give our best even when we're in solitude.

371
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 We find ourselves in isolation when no one is around.

372
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 So here's the thing.

373
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 If you've ever opened a spreadsheet at your computer just to make it look like you're really busy so that way your boss doesn't realize that you're actually checking Instagram on the side, you might be guilty of eye service.

374
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 If you're the person that has opened up a dozen different tabs on your browser to hide the fact that you're online shopping but they'll never know because you can't actually read what's in the tab.

375
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 It's so shrunken and small you laugh because you've done this.

376
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I remember watching March Madness and there was this feature called the boss button.

377
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 If you're watching the 2 o'clock tip off you can hit the boss button and a spreadsheet will pop up.

378
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Your boss will have no idea that you were actually watching basketball instead of working diligently and doing the best you can for the good of the rest of the company.

379
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 If you've done any of these things, you're guilty of eye service.

380
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 You're guilty of people pleasing.

381
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Here's the thing, Porch.

382
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 That's really dishonest.

383
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Recently, Brooke and I were picking up a rental car in Colorado.

384
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 We made our way to the rental car agency and the attendant is so nice.

385
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He's engaged with us.

386
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He's interested in what brings you to town.

387
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 He's laughing at all my jokes.

388
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 I love this guy.

389
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 That is until he tries to sell us on rental car insurance.

390
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I say, "Man, we're okay."

391
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 I refuse to opt in to the toll tag service that they use and I don't really want to prepay for gas.

392
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I saw his attitude immediately shift.

393
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 He went from being my best friend to just being a cold, hard salesman.

394
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Someone that just was running me through the queue and trying to get me out the door so that way he could pull the next person forward.

395
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And I realized in that moment, "Man, you don't care about me.

396
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Like I'm just a path to your paycheck.

397
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Like I'm just a figure for your commission."

398
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And listen, I have no disrespect for the fact that the guy's doing his job.

399
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 But where I take issue is that he's doing his job not out of concern or care for the customer.

400
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 He's doing it out of concern and care for himself.

401
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 So much so that he was adamant about me leaving him a review.

402
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 He like wrote his name down.

403
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Like, "Hey man, don't forget my name's Dan.

404
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 It's spelled D-A-N.

405
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I know how to spell Dan, you know, or Bob or Jim, whatever it was.

406
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I know.

407
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I've got it, brother."

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 He was that adamant about getting something out of this exchange.

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And too often we do the same thing.

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 But that shouldn't be the case because if you're a follower of Jesus, you don't angle your way into some kind of role or finesse yourself into some sort of new opportunity or maneuver your way to be a part of that conversation in that room, a part of that board meeting.

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 That's not what we do.

412
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 That's duplicitous.

413
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 It's not singular at heart.

414
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You see, we don't just work hard whenever other people can see us because here's the thing, and you better hear me on this.

415
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 The one that assigned you the work never loses sight of you.

416
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Like you think you're taking job orders from some boss?

417
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 No.

418
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Your life is carefully orchestrated by a sovereign God.

419
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And he has put you where you are.

420
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And I promise there is good in it.

421
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 There is redemptive purpose behind it, even if it is difficult.

422
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 But if you think no one's watching, you are grievously mistaken.

423
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Because he's always watching.

424
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 He sees everything.

425
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Which I know can feel really intense.

426
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Dude, it's not that big of a deal.

427
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Like doesn't everybody do this?

428
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 But here's the thing.

429
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 We don't follow everybody.

430
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 We follow Jesus.

431
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Like we don't live like the crowds.

432
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 We live like Christ in that his pursuit of you and me, it was not motivated to impress the opinions of other people.

433
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It was motivated to express the love of God.

434
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 That's how we live.

435
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 We live in light of the way he has cared for us.

436
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 How did he express the love of God?

437
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He lavished it upon a people that were unworthy.

438
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 He gave his very best effort.

439
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 He was perfect.

440
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And he gave so much that he would lay down his own life for you and me.

441
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 A people that were unlovely, unwelcoming, undesirable, underwhelming.

442
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 If he cared that much, if he's willing to go that far, go that hard, we should do the same.

443
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 We should do the same.

444
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 But that's not the only way we work.

445
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Yes, we give respect to those that we work alongside.

446
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And yes, we give our best effort when we are at work.

447
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 But also we care about our work.

448
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Even if we don't love it.

449
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 We care about our work even if we don't love it.

450
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 That's what Paul points to when he gets to verse 7.

451
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 It says...

452
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 We render service with a goodwill asked of the Lord and not to man.

453
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Render service with a goodwill asked of the Lord and not to man.

454
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 I remember when my dad first taught me to cut the yard.

455
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 He was adamant about us doing it a very specific way.

456
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 We would cut it in straight lines.

457
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Edge it very carefully.

458
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And then we would go to blow and make sure everything was picked up at the end.

459
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Which was always the most frustrating part for me.

460
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 I get it.

461
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 The grass is tall.

462
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 We have to cut this thing down.

463
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 It's hanging over the edge of the line.

464
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 We have to edge this thing up.

465
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 But why do we have to blow all of the grass into piles and pick it up?

466
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 No one does that.

467
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Let's just blow it out into the street like everybody else does and let the traffic take care of our problem.

468
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Why do you care so much, Pop, about blowing this stuff into piles, sweeping it into a dustpan and throwing it into a trash bin?

469
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Because where I was just focused on getting the job done, he was focused on getting the job done right.

470
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 You see, he cared.

471
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 He cared about our house.

472
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 He wanted it to look nice for my mom.

473
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He cared about our neighbors and that he didn't just want to blow grass and make it a problem for someone else to deal with.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And he cared about me.

475
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And that he wanted to show me the way that I should work.

476
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 That if I'm going to apply myself even to something I don't love, like cutting the yard, it doesn't mean that I can't do it well.

477
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 It doesn't mean I don't do it well.

478
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Why do I tell you that?

479
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Because that's what Paul is talking about here in this verse specifically.

480
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 That we should render service with a good will.

481
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Which can be confusing.

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 If ever you're struggling to understand something in the scripture, here's a good strategy.

483
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Go grab another translation of the Bible and read it instead.

484
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 See what another translation says about a passage of scripture you find difficult.

485
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I didn't know what a good will was.

486
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And so I pulled up a different translation.

487
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And I saw that it's a good attitude.

488
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And if you go and study the Greek, that's exactly what it means.

489
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 It's to be enthusiastic or wholehearted in what you're doing.

490
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Which means that we don't just give our best effort when we work.

491
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 We mean our best effort when we work.

492
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 We mean it.

493
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 But here's the thing.

494
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 When I say that, I know that the reaction to some of you in the room is like, but Kylan, I don't love my job.

495
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 I really don't.

496
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 I'm in for more.

497
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 This isn't what I signed up to do.

498
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 This doesn't meet my passions.

499
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 It doesn't actualize my potential.

500
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 It's not leading me into the sort of joy and satisfaction that I want to be true of my life.

501
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 I don't love my job.

502
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 But here's the thing.

503
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 It doesn't mean that you can't care about it.

504
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It doesn't mean that you can't care about it.

505
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Again, God is less concerned about what you do.

506
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And he is far more concerned about how you do it.

507
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 It's fascinating.

508
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 When Gen Z was first entering the workforce in 2017, if you read any of the literature that was out there about this new generation that was arriving into the workforce, what you would read is that the hopes were really high.

509
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 The potential was really great.

510
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 That everybody expected this to be the next hardworking generation.

511
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And it was the product of things like our social sensitivity and our emphasis on ethics and our individuality and our entrepreneurial spirit.

512
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 People were even so bold to say that Gen Z looks like the greatest generation, that generation from 1901 to 1928, 1930, that really made America what it is, that advanced our society technologically and fought in World War II.

513
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 Those are some big shoes to fill.

514
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 And yet there was the high hope that, man, the young adults of America would do it.

515
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And yet what's fascinating is if you go and you read in the last couple of years articles about our generation and the present workforce, what you find is that current American bosses, they've changed their tune.

516
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 That instead of seeing us as the hardest working generation, they've instead found many of us to be the hardest generation to work with.

517
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Why is that?

518
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Well, there's a lot that we could say about it.

519
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 And I won't give you all the specifics of why that is the synopsis.

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 But I will give you just a blunt answer as to why that is the ultimate finding.

521
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And it's this.

522
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 If we don't love the work we do, then we're really unwilling to do it.

523
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 That's why we're seeing some pretty alarming data on workplace disengagement within young adults.

524
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Gallup Consulting, and this is your last statistic.

525
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 But Gallup Consulting, they looked at the level of engagement amongst millennials and Gen Z, and what they found is that just under a third, less than 32% of us are actively engaged on our job.

526
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 That's alarming.

527
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 We're disengaged.

528
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 We're deeply detached from our work.

529
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Now, let me be really clear in saying all of this.

530
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 I always think it's strange to try and define an entire generation of people by one set of characteristics.

531
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 That feels like we're painting in two broad strokes.

532
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Like it's a really wide array of people to paint under one set of values or descriptors.

533
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And so I'm not convinced that this is totally true.

534
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And I'm not convinced that it's totally true of those in this room.

535
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 I know many of you, and you are hardworking people.

536
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 You struggle in difficult jobs, and yet you burn the midnight oil.

537
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 You give your very best effort.

538
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 You show up and you offer respect to the people you work with.

539
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 I know that this isn't conclusively true nor universally true in any sense.

540
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And yet, I do think it's just, it's so interesting.

541
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Because it points to the reality that, man, if we don't love our work, we're willing to disengage from it.

542
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 And yet we've not been called to love our job.

543
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 We've been called to care about our job.

544
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 That's God's mandate for us as we see it from his word.

545
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 You see, loving one's job is not a sufficient reason for whether we do our jobs well or not.

546
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 We need something of more substance.

547
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 So what sort of substance do you lean on to help you when the days grow long and the times get tough?

548
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 What substance undergirds your motivation to keep caring about your work?

549
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 Well, it says in this verse, "We work for the Lord and not for man."

550
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 We work for the Lord and not for man.

551
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Not for some other man.

552
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And catch this.

553
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Not for you either.

554
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 You don't work for yourself.

555
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 You work for him.

556
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Like, you can care about a job that is unworthy of your affections

557
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 because you work for a God that cares about a people unworthy of his affections.

558
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 You want to learn how to do this well?

559
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Then you need only look to Jesus.

560
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Like Christ, he cared about us when we were riddled in sin, despicable with reputation.

561
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 And yet he still chose to care for us.

562
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 It was his heart to care for us when we were unworthy.

563
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And so we can have a heart to care for those and those things in life that we deem to be unworthy.

564
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 This is the response for those that have placed their faith in Jesus.

565
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 That once you see him and you see him rightly, you can see them and see them rightly.

566
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 You can move into the world the way that he would have you move.

567
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Paul, in a different letter, but saying a very similar idea, says in Colossians 3, 23-24,

568
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 "Whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men,

569
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward,

570
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 which is really similar to what he says in verse 8,

571
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord,

572
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 whether he's a bond servant or is free."

573
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Why do we work heartily, with sincerity, as if we truly care?

574
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Because we know this, porch, and this is where we'll end.

575
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 If your job's hard, if your boss is difficult, if your coworkers are crazy,

576
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 and somehow your working reality never got better,

577
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 you can be assured that you have an inheritance in Christ Jesus, and it will get better.

578
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 That the moment you live in now, it is but a blip on the grand spectrum of your eternity,

579
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 if you've placed your faith in Christ.

580
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 That today, whatever your situation is with Jesus, it's the worst day you can ever know.

581
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Because tomorrow it will get better, and the day after it will get better,

582
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 and the day after it will improve,

583
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 because not your circumstances just get better and better and better and better,

584
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 but you walk with Christ.

585
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 You behold King Jesus.

586
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 You become like him yourself.

587
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 You belong to his people, and you believe what he's doing in the world.

588
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 That he's saving it.

589
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 That he's rescuing folks.

590
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 He's pushing back darkness.

591
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 He's setting captives free.

592
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 And he's invited you to be a part of it.

593
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 What work is as worthy as that?

594
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 No work.

595
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And yet the beauty of it is, everything that Christ has come to do,

596
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 which he has brought you into the fold of, he has called you and commissioned you to join in,

597
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 all of those things, it happens wherever it is you work right now.

598
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 That yes, you do get to help save souls, push back darkness.

599
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 You get to establish God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

600
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 Like that's the beauty of the scripture.

601
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 If you study the Bible, what you realize is God has big plans for work.

602
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Like everything starts in a garden state, but everything ends in a city state.

603
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Like he's working the world through you and I to a place where culture is vibrant

604
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 and society bursts with life and people are advanced, not to their own glory,

605
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 but to the glory of God.

606
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 And the reason we know that this inheritance is promised to us is because we know that our peace in life,

607
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 it's not found in our satisfaction on the job.

608
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 It's found through our satisfaction in God.

609
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 We know it's not found in our performance for our boss, but it's found in the performance of Christ on the cross.

610
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 And we know it's not found in the approval of any other person, but it's found in the approval of your king.

611
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 That king that respected you when you and I were so unworthy of respect, he chose to pursue us anyways.

612
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 He chose to leave the halls of heaven and move into our neighborhood and become like you and I

613
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 and love an unlovely people, riddled in sin, marked with depravity, separated from God,

614
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 and yet sought after by a God that wanted to bring us close again.

615
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 He respected us.

616
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 And what you see in Christ is that he gave his best in life.

617
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Like he came to work to do his utmost, to lay out as much as he could,

618
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 to provide for as many as he could by way of his own life.

619
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 That he didn't just come to be perfect on your behalf, but to lay down that perfection upon the cross,

620
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 absorbing the full consequence of God's wrath towards sin in himself,

621
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 that any that place their faith in him wouldn't receive condemnation, but would receive salvation and be saved.

622
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And we know that he cared about us.

623
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 He cared about a people that were unlovely, undesirable, and so very underwhelming to pursue.

624
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 And yet he cared enough to lay down his life, yet take it up again and invite us to go with him where he now is.

625
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Friends, Jesus has shown you the way to work in that he has worked the way himself.

626
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 Now place your faith in him and work in a way that's worthy of him too.

627
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Let me pray.

628
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 God, we love you.

629
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Lord, I know there's so many people here that come from such a wide array of work complications, God.

630
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Like there's so many people in here where, man, like their reality at the office is horrible.

631
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Their bosses are difficult. Their coworkers are chaos.

632
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 And yet, God, they don't know the way through it.

633
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 I know, God, there's so many in here that, man, they've looked to their job to give them all the satisfaction they could want for in life, God.

634
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 I know there are some in here that have looked to their work and they've said, "It'll be in my work that I'll finally feel like enough, that I'll finally measure up.

635
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Not for anybody else, but really just for myself, I'll finally feel like I'm worthy of the kind of love that I've always wanted."

636
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 God, I pray that people would know here the fullness of life is found in one place, in one place alone, and that's your son.

637
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 And the deepness of soul satisfaction will not be curbed by some job or performance review, but it will be curbed only by you, King Jesus.

638
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 And the enoughness that so many long for has already been attested to through the life and the death and the resurrection of our Savior.

639
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 We love you, God. Would you work here in this time, please, I pray.

640
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,840
 Amen.
