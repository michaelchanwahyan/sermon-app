[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.180]   - How we doing?
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.600]   Hey, if you're listening
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.720]   and somebody just led you in worship,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.980]   would you just thank them?
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.460]   Jared in Fort Worth,
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.120]   maybe Jake or someone in Houston, El Paso, Tulsa,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.040]   wherever you're at,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.340]   if somebody just led you in worship,
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.160]   I hope you thanked them.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.200]   We have incredibly gifted musicians here.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.760]   In Dallas, we were just led by Shane and Shane.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.040]   Last week, at the end of the message,
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.000]   there's a song after the message, a response song,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.680]   so that we can worship and reflect on what was taught.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.040]   And I sat down or stood there to worship last week,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.960]   and there was just something off with the song.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.320]   I couldn't quite figure out what it was,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.160]   but I was listening.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.920]   I was like, man, somebody sounds off.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.160]   I was trying to figure it out.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.640]   It sounded like an instrument was out of tempo,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.980]   or there was this weird echo, or something was going on.
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.520]   And so there was some different folks mixing in the back.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.360]   And I talked to David, he's like,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.480]   "Yeah, I think somebody was mixing off or something."
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.320]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.840]   You know, we're always kind of debriefing,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.600]   talking through what went well, what didn't.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.880]   And it was like, "Hey, that last song, man,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.320]   "there was something off there."
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.560]   I felt like I couldn't even worship.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.920]   It was like a distraction.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.740]   And then I was at dinner with Shane B,
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.580]   and we were talking, I said,
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.280]   "Hey, what happened in that last song?"
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.580]   He said, "Oh, that was me."
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.360]   He said, "Yeah, I was experimenting with a new pedal."
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.200]   And whatever that is.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.760]   And I forgot to turn it off.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.520]   And so when I was strumming my guitar,
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.800]   it was echoing and it was throwing the tempo off.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.600]   I was like, "Yeah, I was throwing the tempo off."
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.480]   I knew something was just not quite right.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.000]   Because when we sing, like what just happened,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   and I know it happened in your heart too,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.400]   is like we're singing these beautiful music to God,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.640]   and you don't really hear any instruments.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   All of the instruments come together.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.200]   And you don't hear one standing out.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.360]   They all come together, layered on top of each other
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720]   to produce something beautiful.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   And when everyone is playing their role well,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.560]   it produces something beautiful.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.600]   This incredible song that stirs your affections for God.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.480]   It's worshipful, seeing it.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.040]   It's worshipful.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.360]   It moves you towards God.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.120]   But if something's off,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.440]   and we don't get to experience that a lot here,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.260]   but if something is off,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.700]   it's really a distraction from worship.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.840]   And I start there because in 1 Peter chapter three,
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.440]   he's going to take us into roles of marriage.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.880]   And I've seen this.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.280]   When two people come together
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.080]   and they play their roles well,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.460]   not trying to play the same sound or make the same sound,
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.980]   but they understand, they play a different role,
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.720]   they come together, it's like a beautiful song.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.800]   You see it, it's beautiful.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.840]   You don't see it often, sadly.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.640]   Not often enough.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   But when you see it, your affections for God are even stirred
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   because marriage is a metaphor.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.740]   God invented marriage.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.040]   The first marriage happened in the Garden of Eden.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.480]   He was the efficient.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.680]   You can ask this crazy question, why do we get married?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.520]   You don't need to.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.960]   You don't need to get married to have kids.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.120]   In an unbelieving culture, a secular world,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.800]   why would you get married?
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.760]   Tax breaks, that came later.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.360]   God invented marriage to teach us something about Him,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.360]   to show us something about Him.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.760]   And then He kind of tells us what it looks like.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.640]   He made male and female.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.360]   He put them together in the covenant of marriage
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.600]   to play roles.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   We're gonna talk through those roles this evening.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.200]   And I've seen marriages personally
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.220]   that were like an unbearable noise.
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.520]   There was something there that caused me to wince back,
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.440]   it's like, oh man, that is just not right.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.580]   And the problem is that we don't think of marriage
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.540]   like a beautiful song.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.680]   We think of marriage as two similar instruments
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.000]   playing at the same time.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.960]   When a song is beautiful,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.680]   you don't hear any one instrument.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.400]   You hear them melting into each other
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.840]   to create something beautiful.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.280]   And so this evening, I wanna talk about choosing a spouse
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.960]   based on the role they will play.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.600]   The reason I'm gonna teach from that angle,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.880]   and I'll be true to the text,
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.700]   but it's because most of us are predominantly single.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.020]   Most of you listening right now are looking for a spouse.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.680]   You don't currently have one.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.320]   And so when we're looking at the roles
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   that a spouse will play,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.700]   this will really help you in your searching.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.600]   And so when Shane is building the band,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.160]   he doesn't just put people into it.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.280]   When Jared is building the band,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.840]   he doesn't just say, hey, you know,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.240]   come and why don't you give your shot on keyboard
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.760]   or hey, here's two drumsticks, see what you got.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.320]   No, he goes and finds people and he auditions
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.360]   so that they can prove that they can play that role well
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.160]   in dating this thing that we've invented
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.960]   and that we do in the 21st century
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.880]   is we're looking for a spouse.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.220]   It's really the audition.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.580]   You are trying to see if they can play that role well.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.720]   You are showing that you can play your role well,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.520]   but if you don't know what the roles are,
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.360]   then you don't know how to appropriately audition
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.480]   or have someone audition for them.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.600]   Here's what I'm saying, right?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.480]   Everybody wants happily ever after.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.840]   Everyone, every marriage that I've done,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.220]   every marriage that I've been to,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.280]   every marriage that I've seen or talked about,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.120]   when they got married,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   they assumed it was gonna be happily ever after.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.520]   This is everyone who gets married.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.680]   They assume that it's going to be happily ever after.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.140]   But what happens is that journey down that road,
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.360]   half of them just boom, fall off the map.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.960]   Half of them fail miserably.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.720]   Any statistic you look at, it's about 50%.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.780]   Even if you heard, hey, it's not nearly as bad,
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.480]   if you read deeper into that, it's like 48%.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.320]   It's around 50% the divorce rate.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.440]   And then what's crazy about that is then I've seen
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.600]   people who stay married, but they're miserably married.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.920]   So they're married, but it's like
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.160]   they're sleeping in separate rooms,
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.460]   living in separate houses.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.000]   They have weird stuff going on, like open marriages.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.440]   They don't love each other, they don't talk.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.320]   I mean, just think about marriages you've known,
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.360]   like your friend's marriage, maybe your parent's marriage.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.160]   It's like, man, y'all, what kind of marriage do you have?
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.360]   That's weird.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.280]   It seems like y'all don't even like each other.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.000]   But they're not divorced, they're undivorced.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.920]   And so this makes up a whole 'nother section of this pie.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.680]   It's those who are unhappily married.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.600]   And now this sliver up there, that top quarter piece,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.880]   that's a smaller piece, that's still those
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.280]   that represent the happily ever after.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.440]   What does that group of people know?
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.680]   What have they figured out that we need to learn from?
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.240]   That the vast majority of people fail at this,
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.920]   and then there's these folks that actually get it right.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.560]   I think they understand the roles
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.680]   that they were intended to play in marriage.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.160]   And so as we move through this text
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.120]   in 1 Peter chapter three, verses one through seven,
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.360]   we're gonna look at three admonishments for single friends.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.720]   As I said, speaking of single friends,
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.040]   and it's gonna go, here's the rhythm.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.800]   It's ladies, I'm gonna talk to you,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.720]   and then ladies and gentlemen,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.480]   I'm gonna talk to both of you,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.680]   and then gentlemen, I'm gonna talk to you.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.800]   Really, Peter, the Holy Spirit is going to talk to you.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.160]   And so stay in there with me.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.520]   Some of you, this is really gonna make you angry.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.120]   If you get up and walk out, I'm gonna believe the best
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.080]   that you just had to go to the bathroom,
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.800]   but hang in there.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.340]   I want you to stay in there with me to the end,
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.120]   and then here's the commitment I'll make to you,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.160]   is that I'll be up here as long as I need to
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.480]   to talk to one of you.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   So if you wanna stand up and yell,
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.040]   or throw things, if you'll do that up here at the end,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.160]   when I'm a little bit more on guard,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.480]   then we can have that conversation,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.320]   and I welcome it.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.140]   Would you just hang in there with me, please?
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.040]   The context from last week,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.560]   we're moving right into the next verse,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.320]   was submit to every human authority.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.840]   Governments, he said.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.420]   He talks about slaves and masters.
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.760]   We applied it to employers and employees.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.800]   Employees, submit to those in authority over you.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.640]   You're not in charge.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.960]   And then he says this.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.240]   Wives, in the same way, that in the same way,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.600]   it's just a continuation.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.560]   Submit yourself to your own husbands,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.240]   so that if any of them do not believe the word,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.040]   they may be won over without words
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.560]   by the behavior of their wives
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.120]   when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.480]   So the context, he's speaking to women
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.500]   who now in the first century church have converted,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.960]   but their husbands haven't.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.080]   They've become Christians,
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.400]   but their husbands are not Christians.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.320]   They're not believers, not followers of Jesus.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.760]   And then he speaks to your beauty, verse three.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.080]   Your beauty should not come from outward adornment,
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.020]   such as elaborate hairstyles
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.040]   and wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.560]   Rather, it should be that of your inner self,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.720]   the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.000]   which is of great worth in God's sight.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.360]   Ladies, take a deep breath.
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.500]   Whatever you're gonna throw, put it down.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.660]   For this is the way the holy women of the past
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.420]   who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves.
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.020]   They submitted themselves to their own husbands,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.300]   like Sarah who obeyed Abraham and called him her Lord.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.440]   You are her daughters if you do what is right
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.800]   and do not give way to fear.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.100]   And I want you to underline that word, fear, there.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.860]   In summary, if I was to summarize this passage,
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.700]   I would say this.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.760]   I'm gonna start from the back and move forward.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.960]   Do not be afraid.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.080]   Rather, put your hope in God, ladies.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.560]   This hope is displayed in the way that you dress
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.240]   and the way that you submit to,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.540]   or I'm gonna use the word follow, your husband.
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:23.440]   And if you don't have a husband yet, then, point one,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.280]   my first point this evening, ladies,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.040]   choose your husband carefully because you will follow him.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.020]   I'm taking this word submit and saying
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.960]   because you will follow him.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.020]   This comes from verse one and verses five and six
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.260]   under this first point.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.020]   Because you are to follow him, verse one says submit,
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.220]   and verses five through six says
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.180]   submit like Sarah submitted to Abraham.
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.800]   Now it says follow or submit to your own husbands, ladies.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.900]   Quick distinction, clarification here.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.580]   Not to your boyfriend.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.420]   You don't have to submit to stupid.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.700]   You submit to God.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.480]   You submit to God who calls you to submit
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.620]   to your own husband.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.620]   Wives, in the same way,
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.220]   submit yourselves to your own husbands.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.460]   And so what does submission look like in dating?
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.600]   It looks like you learning if it is the guy
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.020]   that you want to follow, right?
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.620]   Learning if there's someone you wanna follow.
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.460]   That's what you're doing in the audition.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.380]   You're saying, hey, do I wanna follow them?
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.860]   I did a wedding this past weekend.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.420]   I got up there in front of everyone.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.060]   I said, hey, I've met Monica and I've met with this couple
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.420]   multiple times now, and she has a choice.
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.020]   Up until this point, she has a choice.
[00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.380]   She can say, I do not want to submit to this man.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.180]   I don't like where he's leading.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.540]   But in the moment, she's about to say, I will,
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.440]   I do and I will for the rest of my life,
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.400]   as long as I'm alive, I'm going to submit to his care.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.920]   So I better make sure that he's following the right one
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.740]   so that then I can follow him.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.460]   And this is rooted in the creation order.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.020]   If you're wondering, why would God say this?
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.420]   It's because in Genesis, when he created humans,
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.540]   he made Adam first.
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.340]   See, if he would have made them both at the same time,
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.900]   it would have been like he would have had to instruct them
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.460]   who follows who.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.260]   But instead, he made Adam first.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.380]   He made Eve from Adam, woman from man,
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.600]   and he made them different.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.480]   And everyone would agree that we're different.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.180]   And then the fall happened, Genesis chapter three,
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.200]   and it says a result of the fall is that now a woman
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.660]   will desire to play the man's role.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.500]   Her desire will be for her husband.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.220]   What that means is she will desire to play the role
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.320]   of her husband as a result of sin coming into the world.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.940]   And as they submit mutually, I told you marriage
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:47.860]   is a metaphor, why get married?
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.820]   Why did God invent marriage?
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.820]   We didn't need marriage.
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.460]   What is this idea of marriage?
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.220]   It's to teach us about God, and it shows us the trinity
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.040]   as Jesus, who is not in any way inferior to God,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.820]   but he is God in person.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.620]   He submits to the Father's will,
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.660]   understanding that there's a difference,
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.700]   this is what I want you to hear,
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.700]   between roles and rank.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.140]   They are equal in rank, but play different roles.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.100]   Same is true for husband and wife.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.360]   Submission is not, now, it's not leaving your mind
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.700]   at the altar, okay?
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.820]   You have an opinion, you can certainly insert your opinion.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.900]   It does mean that you will follow him
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.600]   when you have a different opinion.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.420]   Submission is not following your husband into sin.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.060]   If he wants to look at porn, or have a threesome,
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.220]   or go outside the marriage, right?
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.780]   You're not following him into sin,
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.260]   you're following a higher authority,
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.540]   and so you can submit, or you can not follow him
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.300]   into sin with integrity, and clarity doesn't mean bowing up,
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.580]   it doesn't mean trying to fight him,
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.200]   it doesn't mean showing him how sass you are,
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.040]   you can say something like this,
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.180]   "I have no desire to resist you,
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.140]   "but it pains me when you ask me
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.740]   "to follow you into a sinful act.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.380]   "I cannot follow you into sin,
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.920]   "as much as I want to honor you,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.860]   "and I do want to honor you, Christ is my King."
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.740]   Men ask me all the time,
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.260]   "What does leading look like in dating?"
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.760]   It means leading in purity.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.860]   You wanna show that you're a leader
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.940]   submitted to the will of God,
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.660]   it means fleeing sexual immorality,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.180]   that you would lead them not into temptation,
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.660]   lead them not into sin,
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.840]   you wanna prove that you're a leader.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.540]   You lead them in the ways of God's values.
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.660]   Submission is not following a husband into sin,
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.600]   this includes abuse, which is illegal,
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.020]   and submission doesn't mean
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.660]   that you don't want to change them,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.360]   or you don't want them to change,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.180]   submission is a means to change.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.020]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.660]   Submission doesn't mean that you don't want them to change,
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.220]   submission is a means to change.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.740]   Sanctification means change.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.100]   If you desire them to become more like Christ,
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.100]   you want them to change, but it says not by words.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.100]   Not that, hey, did you hear the pastor?
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.220]   Hey, did you hear that?
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.980]   Hey, I want you to read this book.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:14.080]   It said not by words, it says by your actions.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.500]   Remember the context.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.660]   If any of them do not believe the word,
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.900]   they may be won over without words,
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.500]   without words, by the behavior of their wives.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.240]   And so the application for us, ladies,
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.920]   is for you to choose your husband carefully,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.060]   because that decision is permanent.
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.000]   Even if you marry a non-believer,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.140]   this text leaves no option for divorce.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.140]   That if you choose a non-believer,
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.840]   you got to choose a non-believer,
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.020]   and you stay with that believer.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.820]   So your lot in life is that you would try
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.140]   to win him over to Christ by your behavior,
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.020]   and that's a really high bar,
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.740]   that's a really tough lot,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.420]   and I've seen firsthand the pain a woman goes through
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.000]   when she marries an unbeliever.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.540]   Consider how challenging this task
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.620]   of trying to win him over with the reverence
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.380]   and purity of your life.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.420]   I have seen it happen.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.020]   God is incredibly faithful,
[00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.180]   but you don't want to choose that as a strategy,
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.320]   hoping that he, I talk to women all the time,
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.620]   hoping that he becomes a believer.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.180]   I'm dating a believer, what should I do?
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.620]   That's easy.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.260]   I'm dating an unbeliever, sorry, what should I do?
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.100]   That's easy.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:32.460]   Man, we've been dating for five years, madly in love.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.300]   We're not married, what should I do?
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.500]   That's just that simple.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.420]   That's an easy one.
[00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.020]   There's no gray, it's not confusing.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.860]   Hey, there's no room, this is so clear.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.260]   You marry a believer, period, 2 Corinthians 6, 14.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.920]   Do not be yoked together with unbelievers
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.180]   for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.660]   or what fellowship can light have with darkness.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.060]   And so what is our problem with submission?
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.180]   Why do we hate this so much?
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.340]   Your problem with submission comes from fear.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.940]   God is so brilliant that he would address that here.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.740]   They submitted themselves to their own husbands
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.140]   like Sarah who obeyed Abraham and called him her Lord.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.340]   You are her daughters if you do what is right
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.660]   and do not give way to fear.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.960]   What you need to know is Abraham was not a perfect husband.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.240]   Abraham even did some crazy things.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.580]   But he sought the Lord.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.680]   Sarah trusted not Abraham but God.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.700]   She did not trust Abraham, she trusted Abraham's God.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.540]   And so when Abraham said, we're gonna go to faraway land,
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.620]   she said, okay, I'll follow you.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.900]   Your God will be my God, your people will be my people.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.340]   May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.700]   If anything but death separates us, that's from Ruth.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:55.400]   And so here's the deal, ladies.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.340]   The reason you hate submission
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.160]   is because you had a father that abused authority
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.500]   or a boyfriend that abused authority
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.200]   or you've seen men take advantage of authority
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.620]   and you're gonna respond in one of two ways.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.820]   I'm gonna give them to you, I've seen them.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.460]   It always fits in one of two categories.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.340]   You're gonna lash out.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.740]   I don't need no man, I ain't need no man.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.900]   I don't need some dude to complete me,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.420]   like I'm a woman in dependence, you know?
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.540]   I don't need him, I don't need that.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.540]   And do that or you're going to lay down
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.740]   to any sinful desire he wants to drag you through.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.180]   It's gonna be one of the two.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.420]   You gotta deal with your baggage.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.940]   You've got to deal with the past and the example.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.980]   I'm begging you not to hold men hostage
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.060]   to the experience you walk through.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.740]   When you do that, the devil wins, Satan wins.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.580]   He has victory over your life.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.140]   When you say, hey, this experience has ruined me for all men.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.060]   I refuse to heal from it.
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.780]   I'm just going to be sassy.
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.360]   I'm just going to have an attitude
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.580]   or I'm going to completely lay down
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.800]   to the will of any joker.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.300]   And so here's the question.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.700]   How has your experience framed your view of men?
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.740]   You need to answer that honestly.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.060]   How do you really feel about men?
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.940]   And answering this will help you find one.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.060]   And there's men here who love this part of the message.
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.980]   They're like, yes, you know, ladies, you gotta submit to me.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.940]   Run from those kinds of men, okay?
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.820]   That's not who you want to spend your life with.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.940]   I've been married 12 years.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.020]   I cannot think of a time, and I'm sure I have,
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.700]   but I truly cannot think of a time
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.700]   where I've had to play this card,
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.940]   where I've had to go to Monica and I've said,
[00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.940]   hey, I know we disagree, but we're going to go this way.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.220]   Now, there's been times where I've said,
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.900]   hey, this is what we should do,
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.420]   and she kind of looked at me and, are you sure?
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.500]   I've been like, hey, I think we should get a minivan.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.740]   She's like, are you sure that's from God?
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.700]   [congregation laughing]
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.980]   I was like, yeah, yeah, I think so.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.820]   I prayed about it.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.580]   She's like, are you sure you're sure?
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.780]   And then she has this card that she can play.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.540]   Hey, would you mind if we process that in community?
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.100]   Could we get some guys led by the Spirit around you
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   to lead you to a suburban or something?
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.260]   [congregation laughing]
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.860]   But at the end of the day, if I'm like,
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.160]   hey, I've heard from the Lord, it's a minivan.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.260]   We're going Toyota Sienna or something, I don't know.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.260]   Verse three, your beauty should not come
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.860]   from outward adornment, so we're talking
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   about the way you look now.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.780]   Your beauty should not come from outward adornment
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.460]   such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.300]   of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.860]   Rather, it should be that of your inner self,
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.740]   the unfading beauty of gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.500]   which is of great worth in God's sight,
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.940]   for this is the way the holy women of the past
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.580]   who put their hope, it shows where their hope is,
[00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.120]   they put their hope in God, used to adorn themselves.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.460]   They did not hope in looks or plastic surgery
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.820]   or jewelry or clothes.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.060]   Does it mean that you can't wear designer clothes?
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.920]   No, it means that your hope shouldn't come from them.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.940]   That shouldn't be where you place worth.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.180]   Does it mean you shouldn't wear jewelry?
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.220]   No, it doesn't say don't wear jewelry, thou shalt not.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.220]   It says this is not where your value should come from.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.100]   This is not where your beauty should come from.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.540]   Ladies, second point, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.860]   pursue true beauty, emphasis on the word true there.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.460]   True beauty is not what you see in a photo.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.020]   True beauty is what you see beneath the surface,
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.300]   its character, and you see it from listening
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.100]   and watching and observing.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.620]   And so ladies, pursue being beautiful on the inside.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.580]   It doesn't mean to stop getting highlights
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.860]   or to throw away the Nordstrom's gift card
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.260]   and no need to cancel the Stella and Dot party,
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.300]   unless that's where your sense of beauty comes from.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.860]   Ladies, listen, does it?
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.100]   Is that where your sense of beauty comes from?
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.180]   You have to answer this, does it?
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.260]   How much time do you invest in the mirror?
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.840]   How much time do you invest thinking about
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.820]   the perfect shade of lipstick and what you're gonna wear
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.860]   and how that's gonna go with that and your style
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.740]   and jewelry and obsessing and how much time?
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.140]   Is that where you spend your time?
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.260]   Because if that's where you invest a lot of thinking,
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.620]   a lot of thoughts, something's broken.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.600]   And step one to fixing it is say, man, something's broken.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.100]   I find my worth in the way that I look.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.180]   It's deep seated within me.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.580]   You want to begin to heal from that.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.720]   And I know that girls like to feel pretty, right?
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.540]   But it's not a pedicure and a manicure or a spa day
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.420]   that's going to make you truly feel pretty.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.100]   It's bathing in God's word.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.220]   And too many girls are having spa days
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.660]   instead of spiritual days.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.820]   Too many girls are having spa days instead of spiritual days
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.860]   and so think about this.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.260]   If you put much more time and energy into thinking about
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.920]   how to become beautiful on the outside
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.380]   instead of the inside, you have your priorities messed up.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.860]   And what it's really saying is don't use your body
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.200]   to cut corners, to expedite marriage,
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.140]   to get a guy to ask you out the way
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.680]   that you look on the outside.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.540]   Trust God.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.160]   Do you love the gym and hate quiet time?
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.480]   Men, pass that one up.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.420]   She's not for you.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.860]   That's not God's best for you.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:43.260]   And so a tight bodied, beautiful, fit girl
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.460]   with highlights and makeup that doesn't know her Bible,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.520]   has her priorities all out of whack
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.380]   and she will be a miserable wife.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:58.640]   It will be a pretty wedding and an ugly marriage.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.200]   That's the truth.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.800]   Public service announcement.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.280]   Some of you are like, did he just say that?
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.200]   Did he say tight bodied?
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.760]   Yes, I did.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.040]   Public service announcement, pretty wedding,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.960]   ugly marriage.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.800]   That's a fact.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.340]   You will not escape that fun honeymoon,
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.380]   miserable anniversaries.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:22.100]   That's what's coming there.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.740]   And so ladies, don't look at fashion magazines
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.700]   to see what the future will look like.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.000]   Look at family photos.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.900]   Okay?
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.300]   Don't begin to put your hope in what people
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.820]   are going to see on the outside.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.460]   And so men, let me talk to you for a minute,
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.960]   pursue women who are truly beautiful.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.800]   Men ask me all the time,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.440]   well, do I need to be attracted to them?
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.760]   It's one of the most asked questions, to be honest.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.160]   Let me answer it right now, once and for all,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.920]   and so you can answer it so people can stop asking me
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.560]   so you can tell others.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.000]   Do I need to be attracted to them?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.440]   You need to cherish them.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.040]   You need to be able to cherish them.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.000]   You need to be able to make them feel
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.720]   like the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.820]   If you can't do that, then you're not up for the task.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.000]   You must be able to cherish them.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.600]   And so what do you cherish, men?
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.320]   You cherish things that you work for,
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.100]   things that took time to develop.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.900]   You cherish things that you see as valuable.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.800]   And if they're beautiful on the inside,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.120]   but you're not attracted to them,
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.260]   it may be a maturity issue.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.520]   Like guys tell me all the time,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.880]   well, she's everything that you thought and described
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.400]   in Proverbs 31, check, check, check, check, check, check,
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.560]   but I'm just not attracted to them.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.760]   That's a you problem.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.640]   You're not there yet.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.480]   Keep spending time in God's word, man.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.560]   Keep asking him to make you attracted
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.640]   to what he's attracted to,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.360]   'cause you and God have different tastes.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.800]   God says this in 1 Samuel 16, verse seven,
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.080]   but the Lord said to Samuel,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.920]   "Do not consider his appearance or his height,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.480]   for I have rejected him."
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.920]   The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.400]   People look at outward appearance,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.120]   but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   And so are you attracted to what God is attracted to?
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.500]   And you've got to answer this question, why not?
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.200]   And here's an appropriate answer,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.680]   because I've been looking at porn on and off
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.520]   since the fifth grade.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.040]   Oh, oh, Don, man, you're not gonna be attracted
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:23.880]   to what God's attracted to.
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.120]   You're gonna be attracted to porn stars.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:26.960]   You're gonna be attracted
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.360]   to two-dimensional images on a screen.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.280]   You're gonna be attracted to photos on your cell phone.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.640]   You're not gonna be attracted to a human being.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.040]   You're gonna be attracted to something counterfeit.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.680]   You're not gonna be attracted to something real.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.400]   You've gone to a university, a slow school,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.100]   slowly to be educated,
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.400]   to be attracted to something that's not true
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.240]   and not beautiful.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.880]   You are literally shooting yourself in the foot right now,
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.760]   if that's your story.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.440]   Just answer this question.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.640]   Hey, when's the last time you've looked at pornography?
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.000]   And if it's, you know, April, okay?
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.280]   We've got a problem you need to heal from.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.000]   And so what you do, God in his sovereignty loves you so much
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.800]   that he'd have you hearing this message
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.040]   that before you get up from that seat,
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.140]   you make a commitment, I'm done.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.060]   I am done destroying my marriage long before it started.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.000]   I am done being a pitiful husband
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.720]   to my children I've never met,
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.240]   who haven't been born yet.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.720]   I'm done.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.280]   And you say, I commit to carving time out of my life
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.200]   to pursue healing, to prioritize healing over pornography.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.400]   And it's going to be work.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.480]   I'm just going to tell you,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.400]   as someone who has walked this path,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.680]   it's going to be hard work.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.940]   And you got a man up to the task.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:57.880]   Do you believe God's word is true?
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.280]   Says charm is deceptive, beauty is fleeting,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.400]   but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.440]   Do we believe that beauty is fleeting?
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.440]   Do we believe that what is on the outside is diminishing
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.120]   and that you will be left with what is on the inside?
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.080]   That's what you're going to be left with.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.840]   There's a study that the guy
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.820]   who is the vice president of OKCupid did,
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.080]   and he just said that women,
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.920]   he studied people from between 20 and 50 every single year,
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.500]   men and women between 20 and 50.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.720]   So for 30 years, every year,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.440]   studied them the data on dating websites and dating apps
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.720]   to see who they were attracted to, specifically what age.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.620]   And so a 20-year-old woman was attracted to,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.960]   most attracted to roughly a 20-year-old man,
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.240]   a slightly older, a 23-year-old man.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.440]   A 50-year-old woman was attracted to a 48-year-old man.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.120]   So with women, it kind of moved.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.200]   With men at every single age between 20 and 50,
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 35, 37, 42 to 50,
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.500]   they were attracted to a 20-year-old woman,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.720]   21, 22, 23.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.020]   You tracking with me?
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.940]   The attraction remained the same.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.780]   Here's why I say that.
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.140]   A lot of you girls just got incredibly depressed.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.820]   Just hang in there with me.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.420]   It's never too late to become beautiful on the inside.
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.760]   [congregation laughing]
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.300]   What it's saying, men, this is for you,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.660]   the moment you say, "I do,"
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.900]   assuming that she's older than 20,
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.240]   the physical attraction is diminishing
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.300]   from that moment forward.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.860]   You better have something else.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.540]   There better be character there.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.420]   There better be depth there.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.220]   Because you just invested,
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.300]   if you invested in the physical, a depreciating asset.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.220]   So there has to be more.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.820]   Rather, it should be that of your inner self,
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.660]   of your inner beauty,
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.380]   of the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit,
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.620]   which is of great worth in God's sight.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.420]   And people have spent a lot of time
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.220]   to figure out what gentle and quiet spirit means.
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.720]   And I'm here to exegete it from the Greek for you.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.400]   It means gentle and quiet spirit.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.440]   So you can think about that all you want,
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.340]   hoping that it becomes something else.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.640]   What it means is gentle and quiet spirit.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.580]   And so if you're like,
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.740]   well, if I'm loud and a rough kind of girl,
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.860]   does it mean I'll stay single?
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.700]   Probably.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.700]   Hey, how come no guy's interested in me?
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.180]   Because we're afraid of you.
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.220]   That's the truth.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.500]   And so it's okay.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.920]   I'm not trying to be a jerk.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.220]   I'm reading the scripture.
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.980]   Take some time, figure out what gentle and quiet means.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.820]   We'll figure it out.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.540]   We can work on that together.
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.700]   And so I've seen this play out over and over.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.200]   Girls tries to relate to guys by being more like a guy.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.340]   I've seen it.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.620]   I've seen, man, I like to smoke cigars too, you know,
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.340]   and go cowboys and wanna wrestle.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.600]   And it's like, listen,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.860]   guys don't want guys.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.460]   They don't.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.740]   That's the truth.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.180]   I'm helping you right now.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.500]   I've seen a lot of marriages.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.100]   I've seen thousands and thousands of young girls,
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.260]   thousands of relationships, truly thousands.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.060]   That's not what a guy's going for.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.220]   Okay?
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.860]   And so God made you a girl.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.680]   I've got two.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.740]   I have two daughters.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.300]   I think they're awesome.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.580]   I think girls are awesome.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:41.140]   I want to instill in them a beauty that doesn't fade
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.560]   because I want them to be beautiful,
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.540]   but I know that's gonna change.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.460]   The outside's gonna change.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.960]   What I want to be left is character.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.140]   Let me tell you a really obscure story, okay?
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.060]   A couple disclaimers up front.
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:54.780]   I was not a Christian, not a believer,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.740]   not walking with the Lord.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.780]   What I did, I do not condone.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.300]   I do not condone the actions of the story
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.860]   I'm about to tell you.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.420]   And when I graduated from college, I was living in a duplex,
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.340]   and my best friend said,
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.540]   "Hey, why don't you move in with my family?"
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.500]   And I did, moved in with him, short term,
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.420]   about three months.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.280]   When I lived there, I saw two things
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.980]   that I shouldn't have seen.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.020]   My friend has a 20-year-old,
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.460]   had a 20-year-old sister, 21-year-old sister at the time.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.380]   And so as I lived there,
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.740]   and we had meals together and hung out and whatnot,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.540]   one day I walked into her room,
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.180]   I opened the door, didn't knock, should have,
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.700]   and she was there without any clothes on,
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.980]   and she didn't see me for a minute,
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.220]   and I should have slammed the door,
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.540]   but instead I kind of froze like, whoa.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.140]   And then she saw me, she's like, "Get out!"
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.340]   And I'm like, "Pervert!"
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.540]   And I'm like, "I'm sorry."
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.940]   And I was, you know,
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.060]   and, but it was too late.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.140]   Like I couldn't unsee what I saw,
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.100]   and I'm sorry, you know?
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.140]   And so don't judge me, it happened,
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.060]   and I know it's weird.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.980]   And so the second thing that I saw
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.900]   that I shouldn't have seen
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.020]   was I walked into the laundry room, the utility room,
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.460]   and there's a desk, her parents had a desk there,
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.580]   and on it was a note, and I picked it up and I read it,
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.680]   and it was a note she wrote to her father.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.160]   And I just remember being like blown,
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   I remember sitting there as though time stood still,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.200]   and it was just me and this note,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.040]   and I'm reading it,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.480]   and it just like dripped with gratitude and encouragement.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.000]   Dad, I love you for these reasons.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.120]   I haven't been a perfect daughter in these ways,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.760]   but I want you to know how proud of you I am,
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.840]   and how thankful I am,
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.160]   and she listed all these things.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.320]   I'm reading it, I'm like, whoa,
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.820]   who writes a letter like this?
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.900]   And at 728 tonight, that girl texted me,
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.840]   sent me a text message, I said,
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.340]   I'll show you what it said.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.080]   She just said, praying for the message,
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.640]   I said, love you, thank you for praying,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.480]   you are a gift to me.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.680]   She said, I love you, you are a gift to me.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.700]   Thank you for caring for our children on Tuesdays,
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.560]   I said, she said, thank you for faithfully providing for us
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.340]   so I can, and for just being faithful.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.480]   I married that girl,
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.800]   and 12 years, 15 years later now,
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.080]   what I saw when I walked in on her,
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.520]   that's all changed, three kids later.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:21.680]   I mean, you know, a lot of that's changed.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.520]   You're like, oh man, did you just say that?
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.520]   Sorry, pray for me.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.260]   No, it's fine, 'cause here's, look, it's changed on me too.
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.000]   It's just all changed.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.080]   Life happens, metabolism starts to pump the brakes,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.720]   but the character that was in that letter
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.640]   that she wrote to her dad,
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.460]   it's just grown and become exposed.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.320]   And I can tell you, and this isn't like sappy pastor talk,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.720]   like I just wanna be real with you real quick,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.120]   I've never been more attracted to her,
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.720]   I've never thought she was more beautiful than I do,
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.160]   and I cannot wait to leave this place and get home to her.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.460]   And I'm gonna walk in.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.600]   (congregation applauding)
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.280]   I'm gonna walk in and she's gonna ask how it went,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.520]   and I'm gonna tell her not to listen to it.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.400]   (laughing)
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.240]   And then we're gonna pray together,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.480]   and then we're gonna go to bed, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   And I don't mean that in a perverted way, I'm just.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.240]   Tuesdays are go to bed, like, sleep days, so.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.580]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:36.120]   We're gonna go long tonight, third point.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.600]   Men, I wanna talk to you.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.440]   Can I keep going?
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.080]   Okay.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.600]   Ladies are like, you better talk to the man after all that.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.460]   Husbands, you're to lead with honor or else.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:55.880]   And I mean that because there's like a threat in the text.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.760]   There's this ultimatum in the text,
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.320]   so I just wanna give it to you.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.520]   This is one of the most culturally shocking verses
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.560]   in the entire Bible, and I'll have to unpack
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.080]   what I mean by that, but it's true.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.360]   Husbands, in the same way, be considerate
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.420]   as you live with your wives and treat them
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.040]   with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.660]   of the gracious gift of life,
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.600]   so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.680]   Lots going on there, let's just take it step by step.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:25.020]   This is a time when Peter wrote this.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.800]   It's a time that women had no rights,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.920]   they couldn't even own property or speak in public.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.040]   That's the culture that Peter wrote this to.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.040]   And so women were extremely oppressed in this time.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.580]   And Peter is saying where it says,
[00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.580]   with respect, that word is to honor them,
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.580]   to be considerate of them, not to treat them as equal,
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.180]   but to consider them before yourself,
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.740]   that you would show honor to them.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:53.780]   Consider who you honor, right, like a boss or a president
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.300]   or someone you respect deeply,
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.220]   that in all that you do, you're to honor them.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.620]   Ben Hogan, a professional golfer,
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.700]   when he was leaving a golf tournament with his wife,
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.280]   he was driving from Fort Worth to Phoenix, Arizona,
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:12.280]   and there was a Greyhound bus that came into his lane,
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.240]   passing another car, coming at him,
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.280]   and he hit head-on collision, destroyed the car.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.480]   If I showed it to you, you would wonder how anyone survived.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.960]   And so he shattered his pelvis, his ribs, his wrist,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.200]   his leg, ankle, hurt his eye,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.840]   had internal bleeding, internal wounds to his organs.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.040]   His wife got out without a scratch
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.300]   because just before impact, he left the steering wheel
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.620]   and dove in front of her and covered her up.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.080]   He was a human airbag.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.960]   And so this was his act of living out this,
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.920]   be considerate of her and honor her.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.480]   And so you think, okay, well, I may not have the opportunity
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.320]   to dive in front of my wife in front of a Greyhound bus.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.160]   What does that look like?
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.300]   Man, it looks like not objectifying them.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.320]   It looks like watching how you talk to them and about them.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.540]   And even what you listen to about them
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.160]   because you're feeding your heart in that,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.400]   that you protect them.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.820]   I'm not afraid of this place being a meat market.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.980]   That's something I haven't heard in a long, long time.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.780]   I'm talking years and years and years.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.960]   Because the reason this place is not a meat market
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.760]   'cause it's full of sheepdogs.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.620]   The reason there's no wolves here,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.880]   or the wolves don't last here, I should say,
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.960]   'cause they're here, ladies.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.000]   The reason they don't last here
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.480]   is because there's sheepdogs everywhere, shepherds,
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.340]   walking around looking for men who seek to honor women.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.280]   And it's beautiful.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.120]   And I watch it, I love it.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.180]   And so there are men here that really get this
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.120]   and understand their part.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.820]   I told you earlier, if you're looking at porn,
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.760]   you need to get help.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.040]   I'd encourage you to do that before you leave this place.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.400]   No need to email me tomorrow.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.960]   I know my inbox will be full of hundreds of emails
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.640]   if I didn't say that.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   Just show up Monday night, 6.30.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.020]   We got you, okay?
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.300]   It says weaker partner.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.140]   What does that mean?
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:55.960]   It's just literal.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.800]   That's all it means.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.200]   It means that if, ladies,
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.240]   if you and I had an arm wrestling contest,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.620]   I'm gonna win most of the time, okay?
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.240]   And so that's all it means.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.060]   It's literal.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.800]   Like, if you have a problem with that,
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.920]   you have a problem with biology.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.240]   That's all that is.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.840]   Peter's just being honest with us.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.560]   Here's the point, though.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.600]   I want you to listen to this.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.540]   Men, don't use your strength to oppress women
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.220]   or undress women, but to bless women,
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.840]   to be considerate of them.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.680]   Use your strength.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.780]   This is the profound reality in this culture.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.380]   Use your strength to serve the weaker,
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.800]   not to take advantage of them.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.840]   That would have been mind-blowing in this culture.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.600]   That, hey, I want you to use your strength
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.720]   to help them and to exalt them, to honor them,
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.980]   to be considerate of them, not to take advantage of them.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.340]   And then it says that they're heirs
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.780]   of the gracious gift of life.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.780]   This would have been radical.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.380]   In a time that women could not be heirs,
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.140]   Peter points out that they have an internal inheritance.
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.380]   Women could not have an inheritance at this time,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.260]   and so Peter's saying, no,
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.220]   they have an internal inheritance.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.740]   This is why women flocked to the church in the first century.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:04.620]   It's one of the reasons Christianity exploded as it did.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.340]   Women began to come to a place
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.940]   where they heard a very different message,
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.780]   that men are to treat them with honor,
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.100]   and that they could have this eternal inheritance.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.240]   And so they wanted some of that,
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.080]   so the church blew up and it grew,
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.500]   and a lot of that was women.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.700]   And so this other idea of this inheritance
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.260]   is that God is their daddy.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.540]   I was talking to a friend the other day,
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.540]   and he just said how he had this,
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.260]   he has daughters, father of daughters,
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:38.900]   and he has this really nice car.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.700]   He's a man of resources,
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.540]   and so purchased this really nice car, this classic car,
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.740]   and when guys, when his daughters turned 18,
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.300]   guys started wanting to ask them out,
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.160]   and they said, hey, you gotta ask my dad.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.860]   And so these guys would come to the house
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.700]   to ask their dad if they could go out with his daughters,
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.140]   and what he'd do is he'd take this really nice car,
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.580]   and he'd wax it up and polish it up,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.780]   and he'd park it right in front of the house.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.260]   And when they'd come in, inevitably,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.540]   they'd be like, wow, this is a really nice car,
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:08.200]   and he'd sit 'em down and he'd tell 'em all about it.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.040]   Man, let me tell you about it.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.380]   He started to talk about the features,
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:14.220]   and the age, and the engine, and how many horsepower,
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.100]   and how much he loved it, how much he cared about it,
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.200]   how what it took to restore the car,
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.080]   how much effort went into it, how much it cost.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.900]   And he just talked about his deep love and affection
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.900]   for this vehicle, and he would say this.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:30.500]   He said, but don't you get any ideas?
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.000]   I don't let anyone borrow my car.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.580]   And the guys would always say, oh, no, man,
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.460]   I would never ask.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.140]   I would never ask you to borrow the car.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.420]   And he says, well, then what are you doing
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.580]   asking for my daughter?
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.220]   'Cause how much more do I love her than that car?
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:47.260]   I mean, how can you come into my house and tell me
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:49.620]   you're not gonna ask if you can borrow my car,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.260]   but you wanna borrow my daughter?
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.180]   You better believe I care infinitely more about her
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.180]   than I do that pile of metal out there.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.340]   And what this text is saying, men,
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.420]   is that God sees every act, where every hand goes,
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.580]   and every thought that runs through your mind,
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.780]   and that's his daughter.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.380]   And if you don't have to fear that,
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.240]   but I would encourage you to go outside
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.180]   and just shout up at the sky, God, I don't fear you.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.020]   I'm not afraid of you.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.900]   Because that's what you're saying in the backseat of the car,
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.640]   in your apartment, on the couch, in the movie,
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.780]   and on the phone late at night.
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.000]   God is their daddy.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.500]   And it says, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.780]   I think we read that, and we read,
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.780]   so that God will not refuse to answer your prayers.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.320]   It's not just about God answering your prayers,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.740]   it's so much worse than that.
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.300]   It's saying that if you do not cherish her,
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.980]   and honor her, and be considerate of her,
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:54.020]   then your relationship with God is fractured.
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.940]   Even you going to talk to him, he's saying,
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.340]   hey, don't worship me if you haven't honored the covenant.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.460]   Don't come to me.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.540]   See, marriage is an act of worship.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.800]   It's about worship.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.820]   It teaches us about God, that two become one flesh.
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.440]   What God has brought together,
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.420]   let man not separate for this reason.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.540]   Man will leave his father and mother
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.900]   and be united to his wife,
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.820]   and the two will become one flesh.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.740]   It is an act of worship.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.460]   It's a beautiful song that we sing
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.140]   when we play the roles correctly,
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.720]   that the world watches on in the way
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.040]   that a husband lays his life down for his wife,
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.260]   and the wife submits to his care.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.620]   And it's a picture of Jesus and the father.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.540]   It's a picture of the Trinity working together.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.060]   It shows the world a picture of God.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.120]   And this verse haunts me.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.980]   I've gone to bed after a fight with Monica
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.540]   when I was short with her and disrespectful to her,
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.700]   and I turned to say my prayers
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.340]   and ask God to help me in a message
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.180]   and in the day tomorrow,
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.540]   and give me favor with these people,
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.180]   and help me preach well.
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.980]   And you know what I heard in response?
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.820]   Nothing.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.360]   A haunting nothing.
[00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:10.160]   And it's this verse I think of.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.720]   So I wanna invite the band up.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.840]   And I wanna remind you that ladies,
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.040]   you need to choose your husband carefully
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.880]   because you will follow them.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, pursue true beauty,
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.160]   and husbands lead with honor or else
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.420]   your relationship with God is at stake.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:38.920]   And here's the truth, I had no idea what I was doing
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.960]   when I began to consider marriage.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.000]   We walked into premarital counseling with this pastor,
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.920]   and he said, "You know what your problem is, JP and Monica?"
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.600]   He said, "You know, you guys are just pursuing each other.
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.880]   "You're madly in love, I see it."
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.320]   And he said this, he said,
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.680]   "You need to stop pursuing each other
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.280]   "and start pursuing Christ together."
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.520]   And I just thought that was the dumbest thing
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.780]   I'd ever heard.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.200]   And I look at my own marriage,
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.400]   and I look at the journey that God has had us on.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.080]   Friends, that was the best marriage advice
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.000]   I've ever received.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.400]   In fact, it's changed my marriage, it changed me.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.440]   It became prophetic over my life,
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.160]   that we would stop pursuing each other
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.560]   and that Christ would become the foundation.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.320]   And so when you have a right marriage
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.420]   where people are playing the right roles,
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.660]   it's like a beautiful song.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.920]   And so, Shana, would you play something?
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.160]   I want them to hear this.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.740]   So you hear one instrument,
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:33.940]   and then if we add drums,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.080]   those instruments come together,
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.440]   and we'll add bass guitar, Ross,
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:48.480]   and fill,
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.320]   and keys,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:59.600]   and guitar.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.440]   You hear the things blend together,
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.560]   and it's just like, man, everybody's playing their role,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.360]   and it's pretty, and it's beautiful.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.400]   And it's beautiful, it's like Christ is at the center,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.000]   we know what we're here to do,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.280]   we're doing what we came here to do.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.400]   But if someone begins to fight for attention,
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.280]   or to fight for a role that's not theirs,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.880]   or they begin to do something else,
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.180]   they begin to make it about them,
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.400]   they begin to say, hey, look at me,
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.680]   or no, I'm not gonna take that,
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.120]   or I'm not gonna submit to some man,
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.240]   or hey, you need to submit to me, I'm your husband.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.280]   It becomes ugly, it becomes this thing that's like,
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.360]   is that in tune, is there something wrong?
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.400]   And you're watching, it's not beautiful anymore,
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.160]   it's just like, ah, something's not right there.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:57.960]   But when you put Christ back where he goes,
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.800]   you say, hey, how could I ever play these roles?
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.560]   You can't.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.540]   Christ has to be where he belongs.
[00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:11.120]   When you put Christ where he belongs,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.600]   then you cannot treat a woman
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.360]   with anything other than respect and honor.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.380]   When you put Christ where he belongs,
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:20.360]   then you know you're following someone
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.760]   who is submitting their life to Christ,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.160]   and you don't have to trust them, you trust God.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.720]   Trust God.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.120]   It's an act of trusting God.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.020]   Let me pray for us.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.280]   Father, thank you for teaching us
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.920]   about roles in marriage through your servant, Peter.
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:44.120]   God, thank you for just your example
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.720]   of submission through Jesus Christ,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.360]   who submitted his life even to the point of death
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.280]   on a cross.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.520]   Father, thank you for the ways that we can trust you,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.180]   that you've given these instructions not to rip us off,
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.360]   but to give us life, to lead us in your ways everlasting.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.200]   So we thank you for these seven verses.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.440]   Would you help us to apply,
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.400]   help us to apply them to our lives
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.140]   by the power of your Holy Spirit.
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.560]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.560]   [MUSIC]
