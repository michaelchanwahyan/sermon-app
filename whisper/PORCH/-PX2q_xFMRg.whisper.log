[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   All right, Porch, how we doing? We doing okay? Oh man, it's so great to see you.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   If this is your first time to the Porch, welcome. We're really glad that you're in the space.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Normally this is the moment where I would shift real hard and we would go straight to this.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We're going to do that in a moment.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I think that God might not be done with the moment we just came out of.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I just felt like the presence of God moving in a really powerful and palpable way here amongst us.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And I'm a firm believer, like, we're not the weekly entertainment.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Like, you're not coming here so you can listen to me preach and watch us worship.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   No, God is the reason we show up into this space every single week.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   His worship is the object of our affection. His word is the object of our attention.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And the wonder of God is the object of our enchantment.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And so I want to give you a moment right now just to pray for yourself.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I don't even know what to prompt you to pray.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You just need to pray. I just feel a deep sense from the Lord that you're supposed to take a moment
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and just bow your head and say, "God, I sense you near. Would you meet with me now?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Would you unlock God? You might already be opening up here this evening."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   So can we do that together? Would you be willing?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Again, we believe that God meets with us here.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   He can meet with anybody, anytime, anyplace, but we want to give you a space right now to meet with Him.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Even if you haven't clicked into the reality that He's here and He's wanting to meet with you.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So take a moment and just pray for yourself in whatever way you feel led,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   in whatever way that you're wanting for.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Ask God to give you more of Himself.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   [silence]
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Oh God, the silence is so good.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's a good God to sit in the stillness of a moment like this
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   and to know, God, that while it might feel so empty, it could not be more full.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It is full of you.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   God, we desperately want to meet with you.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And we're grateful, God, that that desperate longing is not unmet by you.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   You feel the same way.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So God, would you meet with us now?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I don't know what you want to do,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   but God, I want you to do whatever it is.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We love you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And it's in Christ's name that we pray these things.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Amen.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Well, hey, it's great to be with you.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm really excited for tonight.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I want to give a special shout out to all of our friends that are tuning in online.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We have not forgotten about you.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   All of our Porch Live locations that are tuning in from all over the place.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I mean, it's amazing what God is doing in this room,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   but He is doing similar things in rooms just like this all across the country.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Special shout out to Porch Live, Great Or Lafayette, Fort Worth, and Dayton.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Would you put your hands together for all of our friends that are tuning in online right now?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   We love you. We see you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And if you're ever in Dallas, come and spend a little bit of time with us.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Well, I don't know if there's something in your life that you've sworn to yourself
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   you would never, ever do.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   But there is one thing in my life that I've said,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   "Man, there's no way I would be caught dead doing that."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You want to know what it is?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I have sworn to myself that I will never, ever run through an airport.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Not that there's something wrong with that.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I'm sure people that are doing it have a really good reason to do so.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I just can't think of one.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I think that there's plenty of reason to make your way out of that type of situation
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   if you would just prepare in advance.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Buy your tickets early, make sure your parking is booked,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   download your mobile boarding pass, show up,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   and if you're checking bags, give time for that.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Just know, man, TSA is probably going to be a little bit tricky.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Something's going to go wrong.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Someone's hair product or shampoo, body wash is going to signal something
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   because they didn't get the right size liquid container.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It's going to stymie the rest of your progress through that space.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It's not that difficult.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And yet, as luck would have it, my wife and I, when we were in Frankfurt, Germany,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   in the middle of a layover between one flight to the next,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   found ourselves in a situation, Alexa, which I never would have invited upon myself.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You see, we landed, and in the midst of our layover, we knew,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   "Okay, we've got like 45 minutes," which is brief, but it's also convenient
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   because we know exactly where we're going.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   We've prepared very well. We know the gate that we're moving to.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   We check one more time. We exit our plane. We start walking our way.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And right as we get to the gate that we thought we were going to be leaving from,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I look up, and I do not see the name of the city to which we are flying to.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Cue the appropriate airport panic that I've never wanted to feel in my life.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   You see, somewhere between us landing, checking our boarding pass,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and then deboarding the plane, our gate got updated.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And yet, we did not know about it. So we had made our way to the wrong place,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and yet in this moment, having casually strolled our way to where we were then,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   where we originally thought we were going, we realized there's nothing casual
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   about the situation we're in now.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   We have got not 45 minutes, 10 minutes to get from one terminal to the next,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   lest we miss our flight altogether.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   What do you think we did in that moment?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   We ran. 1,000% we ran.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But we tried to do that thing where you sort of like run/walk
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   because you don't want to draw attention to yourself
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   or be considered as odd to the rest of the surrounding people.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And yet what we realized as we did that is it wasn't exactly working.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   People were looking at us, and we stood out,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   and we realized we're not getting where we need to go in the time that we need to get there.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And so what we decided to do is we shifted gears.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   We went into high drive, and we picked up our luggage.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   It was no longer working to roll it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   We were pushing through crowds. Excuse me. Pardon me. I'm so sorry.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And we were racing through the airport yelling, "Go, go, go!"
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Like paratroopers deployed into a drop zone.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I mean, this was our situation because though our destination had not changed,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   our situation had changed.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And because our situation changed,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   everything about the way we moved in that moment changed as well.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Why do I tell you that?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Because I think that we're living in a very special time in history
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   where God is moving in a uniquely different way.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And yet the window to be a part of it is slowly closing.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And that should change everything about the way we move.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   What are you talking about, Kylan?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Well, I don't know if you're aware,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   but there is something genuinely amazing happening all across
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   not just our country, but the globe.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And it goes by the name of revival.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Maybe you don't like that name.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   People have a variety of responses when they hear the word revival.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Some are very hopeful. Others are very gullible.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Some are very skeptical. Some are very cynical.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I don't know what your response is or what other word you would prefer.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   An outpouring, an awakening.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   What we can agree to is something is happening right now in our modern moment.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   If you don't believe me, then just listen to this.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   The Barna Group recently reported that 66% of Americans
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   have made personal commitments to Jesus that are important in their lives today.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   The reason that's so meaningful is because that is up 12% in just three years
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   from when it was at its lowest mark
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   over the course of Barna's 30-year tracking history of the same statistic.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Three years. It rose to 66%.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   According to their estimation, this is the clearest indication
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   of a meaningful spiritual renewal in the United States, which is amazing.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And yet what's even more amazing is its young adults
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   that are leading the way on this particular movement.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And even more amazing is its young men.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Crazy to think that that's true.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   But it's not just happening here in America.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   This is also happening all over the globe, like in the UK.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Church attendance has quadrupled amongst young adults.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   But catch this, it has quintupled amongst young men,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   continuing the trend that we're seeing here in the States.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   In Australia, more than 800,000 people have moved from identifying as irreligious
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   to Christian according to the national census that they took last year.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   800,000 people.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   With 70% of the millennials in Gen Z
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   that was associated within that group
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   saying that their Christianity is now paired with monthly church attendance.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That they don't just believe in God, they want to belong to his people.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   In France, the total number of baptisms has increased by 45% in just one year.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   The vast majority of which are young adults.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   In Finland, 62% of young boys, which is the youngest faction of Gen Z,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   but will be young adults soon,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   they agreed to believing in the existence of God.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Doubling that number from where it was five years ago.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And according to the Wall Street Journal,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   there has been a 50% increase in Bible sales since 2019.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   What does all of that mean?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   We are in the midst of what experts are calling a quiet revival.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Perhaps you prefer that term instead.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And yet it's not just sweeping the nation,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   it's not just sweeping the globe,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   it's also sweeping into Hollywood.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Because we have seen people, the likes of which Hulk Hogan,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Gwen Stefani, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Kat Von D, and Denzel Washington
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   have all been baptized in just the last couple of years.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And still others, people like Andrew Hubberman,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   affirming his faith in God to jelly roll,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   openly claiming a heart for Jesus,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   has led us to this one irrefutable fact
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   that God is moving.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   He's moving.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   He's actually making a meaningful movement.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   He's been doing this all over the course of history,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and yet what's significant about the moment we find right now
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   is we can see it, not just here and not just within ourselves,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   but out there amongst them as well.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   So we need to ask ourselves,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   how does this change the way we move in response?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   If God is moving,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   how then does that change the way that I move through my life?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Because I think it should.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I think that Jesus has a far bigger vision
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   for the life he's come to give you than you may well know.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And it doesn't matter where you fall on the spectrum of spirituality.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I think that this is true for Christians and non-Christians alike.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I think that for many Christians,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   we fear that we'll go too far spiritually,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   that we actually don't go far enough spiritually.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   For non-Christians, I think we look at our lives and we say,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   "Man, it's good as is."
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And yet how much better might it be if you actually know Jesus?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Think about what he has done.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   He left heaven.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   He came to earth.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   He lived the perfect life.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   He resisted every inch and ounce of temptation imaginable.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And then he moved to the cross.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   He died a horrific death, a death that you deserve.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And yet he decided to take up his own life by way of resurrection.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And then he sent power from on high to fill those that might believe in him.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Why do you think he did all that?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Just so you might be a little bit more moral?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Just so you might be a little bit better person than the average human being out there?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   No!
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   That's not why he's done it.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Jesus has done this because he wants more for you.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   The question that you need to answer is if you want more for yourself.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Do you want more for yourself?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   If you do, then I want to show you where to begin tonight.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And the place that we're going to do it is in the book of Hosea.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So if you have a Bible, you can go ahead and crack it open and you can turn there.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Don't worry, I'm going to talk and give you time to find that book.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Hosea chapter 10.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   While you're turning there, we're starting a brand new series tonight
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   that truthfully has been a long time in the making for me.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   If you were around at the beginning of our year, the very first porch even,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   I stood on this stage and I walked in fully anticipating that God was going to let me preach
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   something completely different.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And yet he sidelined that something for a moment that would come later on.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   What is that something?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It's this series.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And when is that time?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   It's right now.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   We firmly believe that God is wanting us to engage in the current cultural moment
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and the spiritual surge we're seeing in the lives of people all over,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   but particularly our generation.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And yet in order to do it adequately, we can't just give a single week.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   That would not be enough.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   We want to give multiple weeks, week after week, talking into this idea
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   because what we believe is that true revival doesn't just happen through a powerful moment.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   True revival happens through persistent movement.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It happens through a persistent movement.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Let me explain it to you like this.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   We've all gotten motivated and up in arms about something that we want to learn.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I want to learn to play the guitar.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I want to learn to get in shape.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I want to learn to knit.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Like that's a thing right now.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Crocheting is kind of in.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   We can get motivated for a moment.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And maybe we even act on that motivation.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And yet what we find is often it doesn't stand the test of time.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I remember when I was a young boy, I was a horrible reader.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And yet I thought the idea of reading was so very noble.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I wasn't great at it.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   You know, whenever it came to our AR points, if you know, you know,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I chose to read every picture book and not any literary classics.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And yet what I realized is leaders are readers.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And so if you want to be a leader, you better become a reader.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And I decided, you know what I'm in, I will do this.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   And so I would go to the book bear.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I would peruse the books.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I would pick those which looked to be the most sophisticated and savvy for my development.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   And I would work through them until I grew disinterested.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   And they started to collect dust on the shelf.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   What finally made the difference?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   The difference was I moved from motivation to dedication.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I stopped worrying about the moment of, of the moment where I cared to make a move.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   And I started thinking about the movement that needed to happen in me.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And if I actually wanted to develop as a reader.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And so I started setting time aside.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I started making sure that my calendar was cleared.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I started giving up other hobbies so that way I could grow in this area.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I didn't need more motivation.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I needed more dedication.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Revival and outpouring of the spirit and awakening work of God.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   It requires the same thing.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Sure, it can begin in a, it can begin through a powerful moment in a room like this.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   But it lasts through a persistent movement in hearts like yours.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It can't just happen like a spectacle.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It needs to be deeply spiritual.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And that's what I want to help you learn.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I love the way that Mark Sayers says this.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   He says personal renewals begin in the hidden places.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Eventually this interchange of heart will overflow out into external lives.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Creating a potential for renewal in the social world around us.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   To put that very simply, widespread revival begins with internal renewal.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Meaning you don't find revival by searching for it, by banging the emotional drum,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   by guilting people into engagement.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   You find revival by seeking renewal.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   A vibrant faith, an intimacy with Jesus, a greater delight in the gospel.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And a deepening of your personal dependence on him for what only he can do.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So how do we do that?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   How do we actually invest in our personal individual renewal?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Well, it's going to take some time to teach you.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   But that's what this series is and that's what the next coming weeks are.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I want to help you take step by step by step in your personal renewal.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   That way you might experience more of God in your life.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   But before we can get where you want to be, we need to assess where you are.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   We need to talk about what is happening before we consider what will happen.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Which means we need to talk about your heart.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I don't know how you feel about that idea.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   And yet this is the appropriate place to begin.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And it's exactly what Hosea starts talking about in Hosea 10 verse 12.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Look at verse 12 with me.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   One verse is all we're working tonight.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   He says, "So for yourselves righteousness, reap steadfast love.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Break up your fallow ground for it's time to seek the Lord that he may come and reign righteousness upon you."
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   You see, Hosea is saying to the nation of Israel exactly what God is saying to us tonight.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Now is the time.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's time to make a move.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It's time to take a stand.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   It's time to deepen down in your depth.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And the place that we begin is by farming.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Which probably caught you a little bit off guard.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It's not exactly the most helpful, relevant reference point for us, Hosea.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Something that would have been better is refresh your feed.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Share your story.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And then accept the followers that come in kind.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   That would have been a more modern translation of what's happening here.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And yet what he is saying is not out of touch, but very in touch with the people he's speaking to.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Because the nation of Israel, they were an agrarian society.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   They were great at working the land and harvesting a crop and taking up its yield.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They were familiar with all of the work it took to actually bear fruit from the earth.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   As any good farmer knows, and these people would have known as well,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   it does you no good to plant seed unless you have first plowed soil.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   That's what Hosea means when he says, "Break up your fallow ground."
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   What's fallow ground? Fallow ground is dormant ground.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It's ground that has gone undisturbed.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's filled with weeds and thistles and rocks and debris.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's been untouched.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And there's a good reason for it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   The nation of Israel would do this because they would want their soil
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   to replenish in terms of its nutrients, to prevent disease.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   And you've learned this in grade school science or social studies.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It's called crop rotation, people.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   What do you do with fallow ground?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You've got to break it up because though it is nutrient rich,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   it is hard as a rock.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   It has to be loosened.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   It's not accommodating for planting.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It will not give you any growth because it is already overgrown.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   When my wife and I lived in Houston,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   we had an amazing front yard in our very first home.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Amazing front yard.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Like when it was freshly cut, this thing looked like a green pillow top mattress.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And I loved it.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   That is until we had a very harsh winter.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And by way of the seasons change, our yard got wrecked.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Like disease and decay and death just gripped it
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and started choking the life out of it.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So what did I do?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   When springtime rolled around, at the appropriate moment,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   just as Jose is saying,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I decided to break up that hardened ground,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   to till up our soil,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   so that way I could lay new sod,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   the closest thing to farming we get in a big city.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   If the soil was not soft, the sod would not take.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   In the same way, you have to break up
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   your hardness of heart
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   if you want renewal to take root.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Hardheartedness must be broken up.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Your first point.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   If you want to be spiritually renewed,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   if you want more of God,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   then your hardheartedness has to be broken up.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Let me ask you, why do our hearts grow hard?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   For one of three reasons.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   They either grow cold, calloused, or cluttered.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Cold, calloused, or cluttered.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   What does it mean to have a cold heart?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   A cold heart looks like apathy to the things of God
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   or indifference to the things of Jesus.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Like we just don't care anymore.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   We don't care.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And we might not admit that out loud,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   but if your quiet times feel more like
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   you're paying Christian membership fees,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   or if it feels like your prayers
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   are bottomed out of any of their emotion,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   or if you're showing up to church
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   and it feels more synonymous with an inconvenience
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   to deal with the parking than actually a blessing
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   to walk in and experience the worship,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   then you might have a cold heart.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Your heart might be hard in the coldest of ways.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   So how do you get yourself warm again?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   You come close to the source of heat.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   That's how you do it.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Like if you're out in the cold,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   what's the right thing for you to do?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   It's to move out from the cold and into the warmth.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And yet what you know is that
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   it's not an instantaneous process.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   It takes time.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Okay, so then let's just talk.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Like what is the source of warmth
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   that you need to near yourself to?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   The scriptures are abundantly clear.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   It's the word of God.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   It's the word of God.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   When Jesus approaches two of his disciples
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   on the road to Emmaus,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   they say in Luke 24, verse 32,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us?"
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   While he talked to us on the road,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   while he opened to us the scriptures.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   If you want your heart to get hot,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   the way that that works is you sit in his word.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You don't just do it casually.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   You do it consistently.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   You make an effort,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   every effort to spend time near this book
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   where you not only read,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   but he actually speaks.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   That's gonna warm your heart up.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   And if I can just make a recommendation,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   if it feels like, man,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   every time I pick this thing up,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   there's nothing in it for me,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   then I would encourage you go and sit in the Psalms.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Now my spiritual elites in the room are like,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   of course you would recommend the Psalms.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   That's what everybody wants to read, including Jesus.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Jesus did not quote any other book
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   more than the book of Psalms.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And Jesus also had the hottest heart of all.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Like he was boiling inside for the glory of God
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   to a point where he never faced a coldness of heart
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   because he sat in the word of God
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   as the word of God himself.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   That's the first thing.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And the second thing is your heart might be calloused,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   which looks like a cynical or suspicious heart.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Why are you cynical or suspicious?
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   More than likely because you've been hurt.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I like the way John Ortberg says this
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   in his book, "Faith and Doubt,"
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   "Scratch the surface of any cynic
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   "and you will find a wounded idealist underneath."
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Some of you have endured some pain.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   You have suffered some hardship
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   that just does not agree with this fact
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   that God is a good and loving God.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Like you've had something done to you.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   You've had something taken from you.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   You've lost something dear or someone dear
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   you've wanted to fit in,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   and yet you felt totally left out.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I don't know what it is, but whatever it is,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   it has left your heart hard in the most calloused of ways.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So how do you break up the callousness?
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   You remind yourself of the gospel.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   You preach yourself the gospel every single day.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I remember being a young man and someone saying,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "You should preach the gospel to yourself every day,"
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and it never actually resonated with me.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I was like, "Dude, what do you mean by that?"
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Like, just repeat this thing over and over and over.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   What I realized is, no, the gospel is the central element,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   the core component to everything I do
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   as I walk with God and I move through life.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   So when I read the word, I'm looking for Jesus.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I want to connect this to Jesus.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   When I'm engaging with people,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I want to see them the way Jesus sees them.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Whenever I'm by myself,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   I want to think the thoughts of Jesus.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I'm bringing the gospel into my life,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and better, I'm bringing my life into the gospel.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   You think about the gospel.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   It breaks up your callousness.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Ezekiel 36, 26, it says,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   as it's reported in the new covenant,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "I will give you a new heart,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "and I will put a new spirit in you.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   "I will remove from you your heart of stone
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   "and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   If that's what he did in Christ,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   shouldn't we think more often about Christ?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   The last one is your heart can get cluttered.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Everyone's got a junk drawer at home, yeah?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Show of hands, who has a junk drawer?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Yes.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I don't know where we adopted this
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   as a national interest,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and yet everybody has one
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   because everybody has things they don't know where to put.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Anything and everything finds its way into this junk drawer.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Let me just tell you, your heart is not a junk drawer.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Your heart is not a junk drawer.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   It should not be cluttered with anything and everything.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Instead, it should be set aside very specifically
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   for something, that thing being Jesus.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   You see, we often give the space within our hearts
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   away to other things,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   and what we need to do is we need to take that space back.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Some of you, you've given your hearts away to success.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   You desperately want to make it in life.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   You want to make a difference.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   You want to make yourself matter,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and so what you have chosen to do is give your heart away to success,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   and yet what success is doing is it is taking your heart from you.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's not giving you any life whatsoever.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Same things happen in relationships.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   You're giving yourself over to a relationship.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   You think that that relationship is going to give back to you,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   that it's going to benefit you in some sort of blessed way,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   and yet it often doesn't if it's not rooted in Christ,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and if it's not pointing towards the covenant
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   that he has designed for his people to embody.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   I could keep going, but what you know is what Proverbs 4:23 says.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   "You should keep your heart with all vigilance, vigilance,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   for from it flow the springs of life."
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   If you feel that your heart is hard,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   then empty it of what it does not deserve to be filled with,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   and fill it with what it deserves.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Stop taking your phone to bed.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   It's getting you into too much trouble every time you take it there.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Refuse to talk to your boyfriend or your girlfriend
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   until you talk first to God in the mornings.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   He's your first love, so visit with him first and foremost.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Try planning your day from your knees.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I promise you'll realize you're not as in control as you think.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Don't drink just because it's how you unwind.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Go for a walk.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Don't call your friend because you need to complain about that person.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Why don't you call someone to encourage them instead?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Be willing to remove that which is making your heart hard,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   that which is making your heart cluttered,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   and instead fill it with what will make it right.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   We must break up our hard-heartedness.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   As one of my former pastors would always say,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   "Kylin, the hard work is the hard work."
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Some of you need to do the hard work tonight.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Some of you do not need to leave this room.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   You need to sit as long as it takes,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   not to finish the job,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   but just to break the ground.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Not to scratch the surface,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   but to actually impact it for a difference
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   and begin to till up the soil of your soul
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   because until you do, you will not be able to sow into your satisfaction,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   which is where Hosea goes next.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   He says, "Sow righteousness. Reap steadfast love."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Something I think we could all agree that we want in life is to be approved of.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   We want to be accepted by others.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   We want to be loved in this world.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Listen, we're not wrong for wanting that.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   That's not a bad desire.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   You're not wrong for wanting for it.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   You're wrong in light of where you might be searching for it,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   which was the case for the nation of Israel in this moment.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   At the time that Hosea is prophesying here,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   the nation of Israel was being led by King Jeroboam II.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   On the surface, Jeroboam's reign was marked by
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   prosperity and national security.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   He expanded the borders of Israel to a place that had not reached the same extent
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   until the time of Solomon himself.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   He had great political prowess.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   He had successful military campaigns.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   But underneath it all, Jeroboam II did what was evil on the side of the Lord.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   He led the nation into idolatry for 40-plus years.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   What was the result of that?
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   The people of Israel, they were searching for satisfaction in all the wrong places.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   They were looking for love and acceptance and approval in all the wrong places.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   They were worshipping at the feet of false gods instead of the one true God.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   They were gratifying their sinful desire as opposed to the desire of the Spirit.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And what they found is they were, instead of investing in the renewal of their spirit,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   they were investing in the rejection of God's spirit.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   What's the point that Hosea is making?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   It's our second point.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   You reap in life what you sow in the soul.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You reap in life what you sow in the soul.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Let me explain what I mean.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Several years ago, I was at the gym and I was training legs.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Fellas, don't skip leg day.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   As I was doing it, I felt my back tweak.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And so, being a wise and responsible adult, I put the weights down,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   picked up a yoga mat, and I said, "I'm going to stretch this thing out."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So I make my way over, and I start to stretch everything out,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and I feel fine by the end of it.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   I get in my car, I go home, I've got a couple of boxes to unload at the house,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   and as I'm putting these boxes down, I bend over to set one to the ground,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   and I went with it.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   My knees buckled, I found myself face down on the ground,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and I genuinely could not move.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I had fallen and I could not get back up, yet I had no life alert to save me.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I army crawled my way into the house, where I laid on a couch, immobile, for three days.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   It was at that time that my wife, being the voice of wisdom,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   looked at me and said, "We should do something about this."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   "No, baby, it's going to be fine. Just let me sleep it off."
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   "No, really, we should do something about this. I can't keep changing your clothes for you,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   because you can't bend over to pull your pants up."
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   It was a moment of great humility.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   And so we went to the local urgent care.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Walked in, they gave me a steroid shot, they also recommended physical therapy.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I was back to 100%, so I went back.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Ten months later, I found myself back on the ground.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Why?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Because I did not sow into my health.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   I didn't go to physical therapy.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   I didn't do my stretches.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   I didn't work on my mobility.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   I sowed into my hurt.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I went right back to doing what I had always done.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Listen, you cannot sow the same seed and expect a different result.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   You cannot sow the same seed and expect a different result.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That's not how this works.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   If you want to experience more of God in your life,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   then you need to make different decisions in your life.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   So let me ask you, do the hard work of evaluating where you sit.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   I won't ask you to speak it out loud, but I do want you to speak it into yourself.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   What are you sowing into right now?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Like, are you sowing into following that person's account?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And all it's doing is reaping envy.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Are you sowing into your success and all it's doing is reaping exhaustion?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Are you sowing into that guy and all it's reaping is shame?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Are you sowing into those friends and all it's reaping is regret?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Are you sowing into control of your life and all it's reaping is anxiety?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   There are better things to sow into.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   There are better things.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Things that may not produce what you want right now.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Let's just get real.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Things that we call spiritual disciplines are not immediately gratifying.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   They don't give you what you want right now,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   but they will give you what you want most.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So sow into those things.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   That's how the author of Hebrews talks about it.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   He says in Hebrews 12, 11, "For the moment, all discipline seems painful,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   but rather than pleasant,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   to those who have been trained by it."
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Church, there is a better seed to sow.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Sow into your holiness.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Let there be no concealed sin, but only confessed sin.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And then repent of it.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Like that thing which you walked towards because you thought,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   "Man, this is going to give me life. This is the source of joy."
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   No, you realize it's not actually giving you any joy.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Turn back and move towards that which will give you joy.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Sow into your humility.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Like pray to God.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And not just prayers where God would be nice if you showed up,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   but prayers where God, if you don't show up,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   then there's going to be no plausible explanation
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   for how I'm going to make it through this thing.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   I'm totally dependent. I'm lost without you, God.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   I'm fully and utterly hopeless unless you show up.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   He will show up.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Invest, sow into your happiness.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Not happiness from God,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   but happiness, the happiness of God.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Pursue purity, not just in a dating relationship.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I don't know where it kind of got sidetracked.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   This purity is only synonymous with dating.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Purity is living a guiltless life.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Give yourself a reason to live in such a way where you're above reproach.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Don't just pursue personal purity. Walk in obedience.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Believe that it's not just bad things that feel good.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Good things feel good.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   And they leave you well rewarded.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Celebrate life.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Not life as the world knows it, but life as Christ has come to give it.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And then sow into your hunger.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   God, I pray that this room would be characterized by that word most of all, hunger.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   God, we're hungry for you. We want for you, God.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   We have tasted and seen that you're good, and God, we want more.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Give us more, please.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Treasure his word.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   In his presence, find that he is as delightful as his word tells you he is.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   The decisions you make, they have the power to make you.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Listen to me.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   But they also have the power to make us.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   That's what this is communicating in Hosea 10-12.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   It says, "For it is time to seek the Lord that he might reign righteousness upon you."
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   You see, according to Hosea, the call to break up your hard-heartedness and to sow into the soil of your soul,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   it not only reaps the reward of your increasing nearness to God,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   but it also brings about his increasing nearness to us.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   That's what it's saying.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   It's saying, do all these things. Break up. Sow. Reap.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   "For it is time to seek the Lord," why?
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   "that he might reign righteousness upon y'all."
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Yes!
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   James 4-8 says, "Draw near to God and he will draw near to you."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   You may hear that and be like, "Yes, I know."
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   But do you grasp the promise of that?
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Draw near to him. And he will.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   He will draw near to you.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Like, you want for him, and guess what? He's already wanting for you.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   He will come near.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Hebrews 11-6 says, "Whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists,"
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   that he rewards those who seek him.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   That as God sees you and you and you and you and you and you
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   all pursue personal spiritual renewal,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   he actually brings about widespread revival.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   That as you come to him, he not only comes to you, he comes to us.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And he produces that which we cannot produce.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   That which we can't awaken on our own.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Which we can't birth through some kind of technique or some entrepreneurial strategy.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   That we can't stand up here and be so amazing enough
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   that you're actually going to repent and revive,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   not just in a moment, but over the course of time,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   generating a movement which the halls of history will remember.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   We can't do that. I can't do that!
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Nor can I be expected to do it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   God alone can do that.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   And the way he does it is he works through you
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   in your individual renewal.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's time to seek the Lord, not settle for less.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Your third point.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   It's time to seek the Lord and not settle for less.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   It's time to seek him, not casually like we were
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   when we walked to the wrong gate at the airport.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   We had all the time in the world, but urgently,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   when we realized we were at the wrong gate and there was a different gate,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   that if we didn't make it there quickly, we were going to miss our opportunity.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Because the right time to respond with urgency isn't after it's too late.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I learned this lesson the hard way.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   When Brooke and I were dating,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I was horrible at managing my time.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   I was awful at it.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   I often underestimated how long it would take to get to her place,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   and I would overestimate how long it would take me to drive there.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And what it did is it produced a high frequency of apology.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Like I found myself constantly looking at her saying,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "I'm so sorry. I'm horrible at managing my time."
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   You see, the issue there is I was acting in urgency,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   driving as fast as I could to get to her house after it was too late.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   The solution is acting with urgency before it's too late.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Realizing that the time is now, and you should respond appropriately.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   The time to see God isn't after our present moment has passed,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   because God is moving right now.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   We have to seek him right now.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "Porch, seek the Lord while he may be found.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Call upon him while he is near.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Porch, behold, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Now it springs forth. Do you not perceive it?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I will make a way in the wilderness, in rivers, in the desert."
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Friends, let me just ask.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Haven't we settled for less long enough?
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Haven't we settled for less long enough?
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Like there's more on the table. Don't you want that?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Don't you want a relationship with God that's more?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   That's more than just a faith of fact.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   But it's actually a faith of feeling.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Like don't you want a relationship with God
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   that's not just intellectually impressive or emotionally charged?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   It's experientially powerful.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Don't you want that? I want that.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   That's why I'm doing this. We're preaching this.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   I remember when we, Brooke and I, made our way to Dallas, Texas to consider God.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Would you even bring us here?
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   Is this where you want us to go?
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   You're doing a good thing where we are, God.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   I'm not just like ready to up and leave.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Like I love where we're at. You're doing a good work.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   You're already moving there, God. Why would you bring us here instead?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   You must prove to me that it's here you're moving as well.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And as I preached on the stage for the very first time,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   and I came back and I preached on the stage for the very second time,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   I found that God was moving here.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   And as I was processing that reality, God, you're moving.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   In that soft, still voice that the Spirit only speaks,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   I sensed Him say, "Kylin, you haven't begun to see me move.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   You have not begun to see me move.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   There's more in this room than you realize.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   But only I can unlock it.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Call these people to me.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   Tell them that it's time to seek after me.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   And remind them I have already sought after them first."
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   You see, we're convinced that we seek a God who has sought after us,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   for He sent Jesus Christ Himself.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   We break up our hard-heartedness,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   for Christ has come to give you a new heart,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   one that is worthy of protecting.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   We reap in life what we sow in the soul,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   for Jesus has reaped in death to save your soul.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   And we seek the Lord, not settling for less,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   for Christ sought you,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   because He wouldn't settle for anything less Himself.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   He wanted you.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   But I'm not worthy, Kylin.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   You are correct.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   You are not worthy.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   But He is.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   And by saving people who face the very worst of odds,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   He gets greater glory.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   He moves towards the people that do not deserve Him to move towards them,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   that we might be affirmed, "Yes, God, we need You.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   We cannot save ourselves.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And, God, we want You.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   We want You because You would come for us."
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Let us be a people here at the porch that call out our need
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and call out our desire that You, God, and You, God alone,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   are worthy of seeking and we're willing to seek right now.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   It's time, porch, to take these things as serious as they are.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   It's time to believe beyond where we've been.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   It's time to make a change in our own lives.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   I will boldly ask you, if you will not make a change in your own life,
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   then make some space instead,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   because I want this to be a room filled with people
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   that are desiring after God,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   taking Christ's claims seriously,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   and walking in hot pursuit after Him,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   believing that, yes, life everlasting will be amazing,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   but life everlasting has come crashing into our present moment,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   and we can be a part of it.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   I don't want to simply look back and realize,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   "Man, the window was open."
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   I want to realize that window was one I lived within.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I don't want to look back with hindsight and say,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   "Man, God really moved there."
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I want to live into this moment and believe that,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   "Man, God and I were both there together.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   This is what's on the table."
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   God, please, would You work in these people
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and bring them to a place where they take God, You, seriously.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   This message is imperfect.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   We, God, on this stage are imperfect,
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   but God, You are so perfect.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   They do not need us. They need You.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   We, God, are not worthy of wanting,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   but You, God, are worthy of wanting.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   And God, I pray You would know here in this place,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   we hunger for You.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   We want for You, God.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   We see what You're doing across the globe,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   and we want it right here.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   We don't want to just look back, God, and see what You did.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   We want to live now, God, and experience it ourselves.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   At the right time, Christ, You died for the ungodly.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   It is our time to live for the only God worthy.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   It's to Your glory we pray, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Hey, porch, you can stand to your feet.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   We're going to go back into a little bit of worship,
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   but some of you, you really need to work through
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   and process whatever it is God is stirring up in you.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Now is the right time to do it.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Now is the time to break up the hard soil.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   We're here to help you do the work.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   We would love to pray with you if we can,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   but let this not be a moment where we feel awkward about making a move.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   He is on the move.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Let us respond in kind.
