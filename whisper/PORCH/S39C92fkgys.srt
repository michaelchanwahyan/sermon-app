1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:28,720
 - Alright, let's go, welcome friends to the room.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,840
 (cheering)

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,600
 Friends in, get excited, El Paso, Fort Worth,

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,040
 Phoenix, Austin, Northwest Arkansas, Houston, Texas,

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,480
 Tulsa, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, wherever you're listening

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,760
 to or wherever you are at listening in,

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,200
 we are excited to continue this series on mood.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,900
 So I'm gonna start with a way that is particularly relevant

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,760
 to the people in Dallas inside of this room.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,240
 So if you are listening at a later date or in from afar,

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,640
 just bear with us because we have had an eventful past

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,240
 couple days in Dallas, Texas.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,360
 And if anything has been learned, in my opinion,

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,760
 it is that we as a city are not ready for the apocalypse.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
 (laughing)

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 Because it has been unreal how confronted

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,640
 with how dependent we are, how unprepared we are,

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,600
 how no one knows how to stop at a four-way stop.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,680
 (laughing)

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,560
 How much you use energy, I mean, like, what a reminder

22
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,680
 because everyone, if your power has been out,

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,920
 anyone's power been out recently?

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,400
 Anyone wake up this morning, their power's been out?

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,900
 The rest of you guys just, man, escaped the storm.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,240
 But for those of us who have been, it's been like,

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,920
 dude, you are so aware when something like that happens

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 of how dependent you are on electricity.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,360
 It's like we're all out in our car charging our phone

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,480
 like a bunch of addicts.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
 It's like ridiculous.

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,240
 And you're never confronted more with just how,

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,480
 you know, self-service, 'cause even once you charge it,

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,900
 you lost service with people

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,280
 and how important a microwave is,

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,040
 or how just unable most people are to drive,

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
 and how gas stations, of course, being out of gas,

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
 and just everything you're kind of confronted with

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,100
 in a moment of how challenging it is,

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,580
 or would be if there ever was an apocalyptic situation,

41
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,200
 if you will.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
 And yet, the reason I start there is because

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,720
 in the last few days, it's been such a reminder

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,680
 of how many things that in my life I take for granted,

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,120
 things that I just get so used to having,

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
 and the one good thing about having them all stripped away

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,040
 in a moment is that you're reminded how thankful you are

48
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,080
 for those things, how thankful you are

49
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,840
 for just normal energy, how grateful you are

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,360
 that air conditioning is around, holler at your boy,

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,320
 how grateful you are for just modern things

52
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 that every day we take for granted.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,760
 And so tonight, we're gonna talk about a subject

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,940
 related to this mood series,

55
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,860
 and it's an emotion and a mood

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,600
 that really has a lot to do with that idea

57
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,360
 of just being grateful, and it's that, grateful.

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,320
 And gratefulness, here's what I know about the room.

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,080
 Nobody walked in tonight and said,

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,960
 "You know what my biggest felt need is in here?

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,320
 "I need to hear a message on gratefulness."

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
 People came into the room,

63
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,840
 and they wanna know about how to handle money,

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,200
 dating, anxiety, maybe depression is something

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,540
 you're walking through, challenging times, hardship,

66
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,360
 but gratefulness, and that doesn't even feel like relevant.

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
 I feel like I'm a pretty grateful person in general,

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,560
 like I got this, you know, I say thank you

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,280
 whenever somebody does something nice for me,

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,720
 I'm grateful, let's move on.

71
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 And yet the truth is that just like it was exposed

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,780
 by not having those things,

73
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,200
 we're reminded of how much we take things for granted,

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,520
 how often I fail to just drive through and be like,

75
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,400
 "Man, thank you, Lord, that these lights work.

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,440
 "Thank you, Lord, that electricity's flowing."

77
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,400
 In the same way, often, most of us live lives

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,120
 that are anything except marked by grateful and gratefulness.

79
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,400
 And yet the tragedy there is that gratefulness,

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
 as we're gonna explore and study from God's Word,

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,720
 is not just a command in the Bible.

82
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,360
 In other words, you cannot follow Jesus

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,000
 if you do not regularly practice gratefulness,

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,780
 regularly express gratefulness.

85
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,000
 Gratefulness is one of those things that's really like,

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,220
 we said, really of shame, it can be a gateway

87
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,440
 to all kinds of positive things inside of your life.

88
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,960
 Gratefulness leads to being generosity,

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
 it leads to encouragement,

90
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,080
 it leads to stronger relationships,

91
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,920
 as we're gonna talk about in a second.

92
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,720
 And gratefulness is not just something

93
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,040
 that the church or Christians have

94
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
 a corner on the market on.

95
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,560
 Secular studies have shown, here's what's crazy,

96
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,880
 that if you are grateful, if you will just include

97
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,200
 a habit of expressing things that you're thankful for

98
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
 in life, it will transform your life.

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
 There was one study done, or actually,

100
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,040
 it was a number of studies that concluded

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,880
 that if you will, for five minutes a week,

102
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,220
 do a daily gratitude journal, for five minutes a day,

103
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,640
 basically write out things you're thankful for,

104
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,040
 it will increase your long-term well-being

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,580
 by the same amount as doubling your income.

106
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,420
 Let me read that again.

107
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,180
 If you will practice for five minutes a day,

108
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,940
 studies show, in a secular sense,

109
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,700
 like non-Christian, non-related to any church stuff,

110
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,180
 if people will just practice, here,

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,620
 I'm writing out the things that I'm thankful for today,

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,500
 I'm thankful for these clothes,

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,340
 I'm thankful for something to eat,

114
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,740
 I'm thankful for a friend, I'm thankful for a roommate,

115
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,780
 I'm thankful for a car, if you will just do that

116
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,900
 for five minutes a day, even people outside of the church

117
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,060
 would say, it will transform your life

118
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,660
 as much as doubling your income.

119
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,360
 Here's what I know, if you make $45,000 in the room,

120
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,820
 and tonight I was like, hey, I'm gonna give you

121
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,740
 90 grand going forward, my guess is most of us

122
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,700
 are leaving happy, if that's your place.

123
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,380
 And that's exactly what these studies would say,

124
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,620
 and what God's word would say is that it's not just

125
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,280
 something that'll increase and improve your life,

126
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,140
 it is a command from him, and it's a command

127
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,740
 that works for our good every time,

128
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,800
 as even people outside of the church

129
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,560
 are showing and professing.

130
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,960
 Thanklessness, on the other hand,

131
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,300
 is one of the marks of someone who does not know God.

132
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,860
 In Romans chapter one, it says that,

133
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,260
 although they knew God, they did not honor Him

134
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,380
 as God nor give thanks to Him.

135
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,580
 And so as believers, we are called to have lives

136
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,740
 that are marked by gratefulness.

137
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,820
 So tonight, we're gonna talk about what it looks like,

138
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,340
 three components, biblically, of gratefulness.

139
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,620
 We've been in this series called Mood, what is Mood?

140
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,900
 If you're joining us for the first time,

141
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,540
 all the messages are on the PORCH app,

142
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,420
 or on the podcast, you can go check those out,

143
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,960
 but Mood is a look at human emotions

144
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,000
 from a biblical perspective.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,920
 A lot of people think that emotions are bad,

146
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,700
 why do I have those, I shouldn't have them at all,

147
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,460
 and a lot of people think emotions are everything,

148
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,140
 and so what does the Bible actually say

149
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,460
 as it relates to human emotions,

150
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,300
 what role should they play in our life?

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,460
 And we've said that emotion is a gift

152
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,100
 that God has given to the human race,

153
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,800
 and it's a gift particularly given in order to move us,

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,520
 that's what emotion, even the word emotion

155
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,660
 comes from a Latin word, mover, to move,

156
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,240
 and God gave the human race the gift of emotions

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,060
 to move us in a particular direction,

158
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,660
 to move us in the direction of Him

159
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,380
 and in the direction of His will.

160
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,260
 And so tonight, as it relates to gratefulness,

161
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,260
 Jesus is gonna say in a very clear way

162
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,580
 that the emotion of gratefulness

163
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,380
 should move you to a certain action.

164
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,660
 So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 17,

165
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,300
 if you take notes, you can just call this one grateful,

166
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,940
 and we will be in Luke chapter 17,

167
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,080
 we're gonna look at an interaction Jesus has

168
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,780
 with 10 gentlemen, 10 gentlemen,

169
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,240
 and we will pick it up there and explore

170
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,900
 what He has to say about the subject of gratefulness.

171
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,980
 Starting verse 11 of chapter 17.

172
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,220
 Should be on the screens if you don't have,

173
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,660
 a Bible, in addition to the fact

174
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,480
 if you don't have a Bible,

175
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
 we've got some in the Welcome Center,

176
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,280
 that's our gift to you, you can get one tonight.

177
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
 Let me start in 11.

178
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,180
 Now on His way to Jerusalem, Jesus,

179
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,940
 Jesus traveled along the border

180
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,800
 between Samaria and Galilee.

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,420
 As He was going into a village,

182
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,420
 10 men who had leprosy met Him,

183
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,060
 and they stood at a distance and they cried out,

184
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,460
 or they called out in a loud voice,

185
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,220
 "Jesus, Master, have pity on us."

186
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,900
 All right, let me stop.

187
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,360
 Most likely, nobody in this room

188
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,340
 has ever had leprosy before.

189
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,180
 It's not the best of diseases to contract.

190
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,380
 Here's what's going on with leprosy.

191
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,260
 It would be a disease that plagued the ancient world.

192
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,980
 It's a disease that really modern science

193
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,320
 and modern medicine has pretty much eradicated from our world

194
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,340
 but at this time, there wasn't a solution for it,

195
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,740
 there was no medicine, there was no cure.

196
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,220
 It would show up on your body one day

197
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,420
 and it was on your skin,

198
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,380
 and your skin would begin to erode.

199
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,060
 It would begin to make you lose sensation

200
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,420
 on all of your skin, your nose, your ears,

201
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,460
 things would begin to fall apart

202
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,800
 and it would spread all throughout your skin.

203
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,940
 It was highly contagious.

204
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,780
 So here's what happened.

205
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,960
 If you were a leper, you were immediately kicked out of town.

206
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,900
 The day you showed up or the day that you realized,

207
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,400
 "There's something growing on my skin,"

208
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,900
 was the worst day of your life

209
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,300
 because it would be the last moment

210
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,500
 you would ever hug your children,

211
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,740
 you would ever sleep next to your wife or your husband,

212
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,980
 it'd be the last moment you could be around society,

213
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,540
 you couldn't go to church anymore,

214
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,380
 you were a leper.

215
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,940
 Everywhere that you went, you had to yell out in advance,

216
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,000
 "Unclean, unclean," so that people knew,

217
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,900
 "Do not get near this person to not spread the disease."

218
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,060
 So this was a group of 10 men

219
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,460
 who had been living together 'cause it's like,

220
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,060
 "Hey, I'm not exactly gonna get

221
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,840
 "into the Jerusalem apartment complex,

222
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,280
 "so I've gotta hang out with some other boys

223
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,820
 "who've got the same disease as me."

224
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,360
 And so they all kind of united

225
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,660
 and together they formed some little like colony,

226
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,420
 a leper colony outside in between Samaria and Galilee.

227
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,700
 And they sat there, cut off from their family,

228
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,440
 cut off from friends.

229
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,260
 And one day they hear about this man, Jesus,

230
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,100
 who's been showing up

231
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,460
 and apparently he's been doing miracles

232
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,020
 and doing things that have been impacting,

233
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,460
 changing lives, giving sight to blind people.

234
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,800
 And then one day Jesus walks in front of them

235
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,780
 and so the 10 of them get together and they cry out,

236
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,960
 "Jesus, have mercy or have pity on us."

237
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,740
 And Jesus says, when he saw them,

238
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,620
 he said, "Go and show yourselves to the priests."

239
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,220
 The priests were the people who would allow,

240
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,540
 if you were a leper and somehow miraculously it went away,

241
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,180
 you'd have to go show yourself to the priest

242
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,420
 basically to get permission to go back in.

243
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,300
 In other words, to enter into society,

244
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,540
 if you were like, "Man, I think I've been healed

245
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,740
 "of leprosy," or whatever's going on,

246
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,180
 you'd go show yourself to a priest

247
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,580
 and the priest would have to do the inspection

248
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,860
 and be like, "Come into church and we gotta inspect

249
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,620
 "to make sure the leprosy is gone."

250
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,700
 And that's what they were doing.

251
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,340
 So Jesus says, "Hey, go show yourself."

252
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,620
 As though like, "Hey, you're gonna be healed

253
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,780
 "on the way that you walk to that priest."

254
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:01,280
 And as they went, they were cleansed.

255
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,380
 So they cried out to Jesus.

256
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,420
 Jesus says, "Go show yourself to the priest.

257
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,140
 "I'm answering your prayer."

258
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,500
 And they turn around, they start walking

259
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,660
 towards the city of Jerusalem.

260
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,180
 They haven't been there since they got kicked out.

261
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,140
 And as they're walking, their body begins to change

262
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,700
 and everything transforms.

263
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,600
 And they were healed of their leprosy.

264
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,220
 One of them, verse 15, when he saw that he was healed,

265
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,500
 he came back praising God in a loud voice

266
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,260
 and he threw himself at Jesus's feet and he thanked him.

267
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,720
 And he was a Samaritan.

268
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,100
 Jesus asked, "We're not all 10 cleansed?

269
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,200
 "Where are the other nine?

270
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,100
 "Has no one returned to give praise to God

271
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
 "except this foreigner?"

272
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,760
 And then he said to him, "Rise and go.

273
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,500
 "Your faith has made you well."

274
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,660
 We're gonna come back to that last line.

275
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,060
 But Jesus points that despite 10 being healed,

276
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,620
 only one of them comes back.

277
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,020
 Only one had the response.

278
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,820
 In other words, Jesus says, "This is the right

279
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,100
 "and appropriate response that is to be had."

280
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,020
 The first thing I wanna talk about

281
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,180
 as it relates to gratefulness,

282
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,560
 it's just this idea that gratefulness has this power to it

283
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,960
 and particularly has a power to strengthen relationships.

284
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,380
 Gratefulness, when it marks somebody's life,

285
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,100
 just like it marked this leper's life in that moment,

286
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,860
 has the power to strengthen relationships.

287
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,900
 Its presence in your relationships or in your life

288
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,300
 is gonna be something that is a part

289
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,260
 of strengthening your relationships with God

290
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,140
 and strengthening your relationships with others.

291
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,060
 This guy gives us an indication or a look

292
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,500
 at what that looks like with God.

293
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,340
 All 10 lepers had some interaction with Jesus

294
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,540
 and they had some experience and exposure to him,

295
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,980
 but all of them had only a skin-deep relationship

296
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,100
 that he healed the outside.

297
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,300
 But this man, he comes back and he expresses a praise

298
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,820
 and a thankfulness to God.

299
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,780
 And Jesus says something to him that he very rarely repeats

300
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
 all throughout the New Testament.

301
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,500
 Your faith has saved you.

302
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,860
 Lots of times he says to different men and women,

303
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,740
 different things, "Hey, let the dead bury the dead.

304
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,580
 "Leave your father behind."

305
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,420
 Do all these things.

306
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,260
 But he comes to this man and he says,

307
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,420
 "Hey, your faith has saved you.

308
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,860
 "That made you well is the same word for saved."

309
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,100
 That this man, because of his perspective on who Jesus was,

310
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,060
 his thankfulness and him moving in the direction

311
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,940
 of expressing that gratefulness,

312
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,960
 experienced a relationship with Jesus

313
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,580
 different from the other nine.

314
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,820
 Gratefulness always strengthens relationships

315
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,380
 and you having gratefulness in your life

316
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,300
 is a part of the criteria that will strengthen

317
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,460
 your relationship with God

318
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,840
 or the absence of gratefulness will lead to a weakening

319
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,940
 of your relationship with God.

320
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,740
 A weakening of your faith would be another way of saying it

321
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,140
 and a strengthening of your relationship

322
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,260
 with other people in your life.

323
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,580
 How does being thankful to God

324
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,700
 strengthen your relationship with him?

325
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,180
 Well, here's how.

326
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,300
 Anytime that I'm thankful to God,

327
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,360
 anytime that I'm like, "Lord, hey,

328
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
 "I just wanna thank you for this day.

329
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,440
 "I wanna thank you for the fact that I'm alive

330
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,500
 "and another day was given me that I wasn't promised.

331
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,180
 "I woke up this morning, a lot of people didn't.

332
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,300
 "I've got legs that I can walk.

333
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,140
 "Thank you, God."

334
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,220
 Whenever I just begin to assume, "God, thank you.

335
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,100
 "Everything in my life is a gift."

336
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,560
 It's a reflection of a humility

337
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,100
 that I don't see anything that I have

338
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,140
 as something that I earned.

339
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,020
 You know, I really deserve this and I worked really hard,

340
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,060
 but everything's been a gift.

341
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,840
 As 1 Corinthians 4, chapter four, verse seven says that,

342
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,140
 "What do you have that you did not receive?"

343
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,440
 Let me just read it.

344
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,900
 "What do you have that God hasn't given you?

345
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,660
 "And if everything you have is from God,

346
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,420
 "why do you boast as though it were not a gift?"

347
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,880
 One of the things that thankfulness

348
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
 in a relationship with God,

349
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,240
 expressing thanks towards God regularly does

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,180
 is it fights against pride and it fuels praise in my life.

351
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,680
 In other words, everything inside of my life

352
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,280
 where I'm tempted to,

353
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
 "Hey, I worked really hard on that project."

354
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
 Maybe it's for you.

355
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,980
 You're like, "Hey, you know, I worked really hard.

356
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,920
 "I got a promotion, I got a raise, and I deserved it.

357
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,540
 "I earned it, I worked really hard.

358
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,800
 "I stayed after hours.

359
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,340
 "I gave all that I, you know, of my effort to that project

360
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,840
 "and I feel like I earned it."

361
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,520
 That's a posture that fuels pride.

362
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,120
 Versus a posture of God.

363
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,960
 "Hey, you're the one who gave me this job.

364
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,400
 "You're the reason that I got an education in the first place.

365
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,460
 "You gave me a mind that works.

366
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,300
 "You allowed my body to get up and have the strength

367
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,240
 "to work later hours."

368
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,680
 All of a sudden, what is an opportunity

369
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,220
 for me to be tempted to have pride

370
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,560
 becomes an opportunity to turn towards praise in God.

371
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,260
 One of the ways that thankfulness strengthens

372
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,820
 your relationship is in vocalizing,

373
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,920
 "God, thank you.

374
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,860
 "Thank you for a car that even though it's broken down,

375
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,000
 "I have a car.

376
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,900
 "Thank you for another night to just come and worship you.

377
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,600
 "How many people in our world would love

378
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,260
 "to have the freedom to get to do that?"

379
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,560
 It keeps me in a place of humility.

380
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,760
 And instead of fueling pride, it fuels praise to God.

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,580
 As we're told in 1 Peter chapter five,

382
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,740
 "Pride will keep you in the opposition of God."

383
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,560
 In other words, if you see yourself as,

384
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,700
 "Hey, what I have, I earned and I deserve, that is pride."

385
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,820
 And that will hinder your relationship with God.

386
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,380
 It says, "He gives grace to the humble,

387
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,500
 "but he opposes the proud."

388
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,820
 In other words, you're the opposition

389
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,500
 or in the opposition of God.

390
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,120
 So of course it's gonna hinder your relationship

391
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,160
 versus a thankfulness that,

392
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
 "God, everything that I have is because of you.

393
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,940
 "I don't deserve any of this.

394
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,420
 "And I'm gonna turn everything in my life

395
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,340
 "as a chance to just thank you

396
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,320
 "and point it all back to you."

397
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,420
 Which fuels the praise.

398
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,140
 It not only strengthens your relationship with God,

399
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,100
 it's a chance to strengthen your relationship

400
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,840
 with other people.

401
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,000
 When someone does something for you

402
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,380
 or when you do something for someone else

403
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,580
 and they don't thank you, we all notice it.

404
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,460
 When I go out of my way, I'm planning a party

405
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,020
 or I go out of my way to provide for my team

406
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,580
 or to do something for my wife and nothing is said,

407
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,020
 I'm going, "Okay, huh, when is that gonna happen here?"

408
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,020
 It creates this disruption in our relationship

409
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,440
 where I'm like, "Does she think she's entitled to this?

410
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,280
 "Does she deserve it?

411
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,860
 "Did she even realize what I did there?"

412
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,640
 And all of a sudden, what was an opportunity

413
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,460
 for us to move closer to one another,

414
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,060
 together intimacy becomes an opportunity

415
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,020
 where insecurity, entitlement,

416
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,260
 questioning begins to breathe in.

417
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,100
 If you wanna have stronger relationships,

418
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,140
 a stronger dating relationship, say thank you.

419
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,340
 Whatever amount that you think is the amount

420
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,780
 of saying thank you, multiply it times 10.

421
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,980
 Say thank you, say thank you at your boss.

422
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,020
 If you wanna excel more in your organization, say thank you.

423
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,940
 Even to people that you work with that you're like,

424
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,280
 "Well, I don't really have to say thank you to them.

425
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,120
 "They get a paycheck."

426
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,160
 Say thank you.

427
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,340
 If you wanna be more attractive overnight,

428
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,700
 if you got hit with the ugly stick

429
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,420
 and you're wondering how can I look more attractive

430
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,780
 tomorrow, guys, this is for you, this is free.

431
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,320
 Be someone who is grateful.

432
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,900
 Be someone who is thankful that,

433
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,180
 "Hey, I don't deserve any of this."

434
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,280
 Thank you for giving your time.

435
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,380
 Thank you.

436
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,540
 And you're not entitled to anything.

437
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,940
 You're entitled to hell.

438
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,260
 That's what the Bible says.

439
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,260
 So everything else sprinkles on top,

440
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,140
 the fact that I'm not going to hell.

441
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,180
 And so I can be thankful for anything and everything.

442
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,980
 And the Bible says that God commands it.

443
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,620
 First Thessalonians chapter five verse 17 says,

444
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,700
 "Give thanks in every situation,

445
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,180
 "in everything that you experience.

446
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,440
 "And thankfulness will strengthen your relationship

447
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,140
 "with your roommate."

448
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,980
 Say thank you.

449
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,900
 If they pay the bills every month

450
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,740
 and you Venmo them afterwards, say thank you.

451
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,180
 Use everything, amen, yes, amen.

452
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,820
 And pay them if you told them where you were going to.

453
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,500
 But if you wanna have stronger relationships,

454
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,440
 be more of God's man and God's woman,

455
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,460
 have the type of relationships that are for one another,

456
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,740
 saying thank you is a path towards that

457
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,260
 because it always, anytime thankfulness

458
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,820
 or gratefulness is present, it strengthens relationship.

459
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,440
 And the absence is true.

460
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,820
 Anytime that it's not there,

461
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,940
 it erodes or has the potential to erode relationships.

462
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,660
 I remember not long ago,

463
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,060
 I had a friend who was getting married

464
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,540
 and I found out what hotel him and his wife

465
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,320
 were gonna stay in the night that they got married.

466
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,180
 So we got married and then we're gonna go to this hotel.

467
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,100
 So I called the hotel.

468
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,380
 Sometimes I'll do this for friends

469
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,340
 and I'll just ask the hotel,

470
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,900
 "Hey, can you upgrade their room?

471
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,520
 "And can you put in their room

472
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,740
 "some chocolate-covered strawberries and some champagne,

473
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,600
 "or if that offends you, some grape juice,

474
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,260
 "and whatever the hotel kind of offers."

475
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,700
 And sometimes they'll do it for free, sometimes they won't.

476
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,880
 This time they didn't and I was like,

477
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,100
 "It's all right, I'll cover it."

478
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
 And it'll just be kind of a wedding gift

479
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,140
 and gave him this whole setup.

480
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,300
 And I never heard from him.

481
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,160
 And so I gave like the chocolate-covered strawberries

482
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,180
 and the champagne, I'm like, "Oh, that's great.

483
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,620
 "They're gonna go on their honeymoon, fine.

484
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,540
 "I'm sure it'll be great."

485
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
 And I'm not doing it for the thanks, no big deal.

486
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,720
 But hopefully they got it.

487
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,260
 And you begin to wonder, I wonder if they even got it.

488
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,200
 Maybe they sent it to the wrong room.

489
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,820
 And I began to question,

490
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,420
 maybe they're allergic to strawberries

491
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,660
 and I just ruined their entire wedding

492
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,060
 or entire honeymoon they're about to be a part of.

493
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,840
 Maybe they were offended

494
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,940
 that the pastor sent the grape juice.

495
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,380
 And maybe they, I don't know.

496
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,940
 And then I remember seeing him that next time

497
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,660
 and I remember thinking,

498
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,100
 I don't even know how to ask about this

499
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,420
 'cause I wanna make sure that they did,

500
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,740
 I don't wanna be like, "Well, how was the hotel room, huh?"

501
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,500
 (audience laughing)

502
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,620
 You know what I'm saying?

503
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,540
 They're like, "No, I'm asking about

504
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,740
 "the chocolate-covered strawberries, very literally."

505
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,980
 And so like to this day, I've never ever brought it up.

506
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,100
 And Jerry, if you're listening, you know who you are.

507
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,980
 And that's not true.

508
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,380
 It's not Jerry, that's a made-up name.

509
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,140
 But one thing, this opportunity,

510
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,900
 this opportunity that would have been something

511
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,380
 that's like, man, thank you, a strengthening of relationship

512
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,940
 all of a sudden leads to hesitation in,

513
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,540
 I'm not sure that either I should have given that gift

514
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,300
 or I should in the future give that gift.

515
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,140
 Think about that.

516
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,960
 What could have been something

517
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,980
 that strengthens relationships,

518
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,020
 strengthens, sets a precedent for doing it in the future,

519
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,540
 all of a sudden it becomes a chance of,

520
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,940
 I'm not even sure that that was worth it

521
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,140
 or that it even got delivered.

522
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,780
 That an opportunity to express appreciation

523
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,340
 led to hesitation for future things

524
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,940
 or future times that I would do it,

525
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,620
 which really leads into the second idea.

526
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,380
 And this is so huge, and I hope you're listening,

527
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,540
 especially for our generation.

528
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,460
 The second component from this story that we see

529
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,180
 is that gratefulness not expressed

530
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,980
 is gratefulness not experienced.

531
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,500
 Gratefulness not expressed is gratefulness not experienced.

532
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,700
 Pretty simple on the face,

533
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,500
 but let's talk about it for a second.

534
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,980
 What was different about this one leper?

535
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,940
 Was it that he felt grateful?

536
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,380
 My guess is that all the other nine felt grateful.

537
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,220
 I mean, think about it.

538
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,700
 'Cause you've been living in a leper colony

539
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,540
 with nine other dudes, your face has fallen off,

540
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,940
 and one day this guy shows up and everything changes.

541
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,060
 You're healed, you're back to normal.

542
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,680
 You can go home, you can hug your kids,

543
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,340
 you can sleep in bed again with everybody,

544
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,100
 you can enter back into society, you can go to church again.

545
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,240
 What was the best day of your life?

546
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,100
 That day, that day you met that man who saved you,

547
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,740
 who changed you, who healed you.

548
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,700
 My guess is that all of them felt grateful,

549
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,040
 but only one of them expressed gratefulness.

550
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,840
 And this is so true, it's so profoundly true.

551
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,400
 And I need you to hear me because most of you are like,

552
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,240
 "Oh yeah, I get that."

553
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,080
 You don't get it.

554
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,400
 Because if you did, it would transform the way

555
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
 that you interact the number of times

556
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 you're constantly saying, "I'm thankful,"

557
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,000
 or "Thank you for doing that."

558
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,880
 Gratitude, any time you were thankful

559
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,360
 and you do not express it.

560
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,720
 Gratitude not expressed is not experienced

561
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,300
 by the other person.

562
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,040
 If anything, often gratitude not expressed,

563
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,720
 just like in that scenario with like the champagne

564
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,920
 and chocolate scrubbed strawberries,

565
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,680
 gratitude not expressed is not just experienced

566
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 as confusion, it can be experienced as rejection

567
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,380
 or they're entitled.

568
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,160
 It's not just the absence of some like nice,

569
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,880
 oh, positive thank you on top.

570
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,880
 It becomes a, man, I don't even think they cared about that.

571
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,920
 That gratitude always shows up and it always speaks up.

572
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,900
 True gratitude should move you to action.

573
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,560
 So anytime you were thankful, it's an opportunity

574
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,380
 that God is trying to get ahold of you to say,

575
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,440
 "Thank you," to move you in the direction of thanking God,

576
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,920
 move you in the direction of thanking

577
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
 other people around you.

578
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
 Gratitude that is felt is worthless

579
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,240
 unless it moves you to do something,

580
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,120
 whether that is praise God or thank people

581
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,960
 that God has put inside of your life.

582
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,280
 I wrote in my notes that gratitude that's not expressed

583
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,200
 is experienced as either rejection or entitlement

584
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,880
 on behalf of the person who fails to express it.

585
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,280
 The other interesting thing about gratefulness

586
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,000
 is that the more grateful you are,

587
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,780
 the more you express gratefulness,

588
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,440
 it's like that part of your heart continues to grow.

589
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,200
 In other words, the people who are most likely

590
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,280
 to express thank you to other people around you,

591
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,560
 it's like the more that you express it,

592
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,580
 the more that aspect grows inside of your heart.

593
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,600
 The more that you find yourself going,

594
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,560
 "God, thank you for another day.

595
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,920
 "Thank you that even though my car is broken down,

596
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
 "I have a car.

597
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
 "Thank you that I have friends.

598
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,120
 "Thank you that Uber and Lyft exist.

599
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,660
 "Thank you that I've got people in my life

600
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,720
 "that can come pick me up.

601
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,600
 "Thank you that I have a job."

602
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,080
 The more that you see,

603
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,800
 or the more that you express gratefulness,

604
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,600
 the more that attribute grows inside of your heart,

605
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,140
 the easier it is to express.

606
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,840
 And the flip side is also true.

607
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,320
 The more that you complain, the easier it is to complain.

608
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,520
 Like as I was thinking through it,

609
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,120
 the illustration that I was thinking through was this.

610
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,720
 In life, everyone has heard,

611
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,720
 or probably most of us have heard the old adage of,

612
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,080
 "Hey, is the glass half empty or is the glass half full?"

613
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
 Anyone heard this before?

614
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,760
 I'm gonna answer one time definitively for everybody

615
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,840
 if it's half empty or half full.

616
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,800
 Because it doesn't have anything to do with your wiring,

617
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 it doesn't have anything to do with how you were raised,

618
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,560
 or how you grew up, or how you see the world.

619
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,440
 It has everything to do with one simple thing.

620
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 Is the glass being emptied, or is it being filled?

621
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,700
 In other words, is this half empty or is it half full?

622
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,520
 Well, as it's emptying out, it would be half empty,

623
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,360
 versus as this is being filled up,

624
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,620
 it's gonna be half full.

625
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,080
 Everyone following me?

626
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,120
 Does this make sense?

627
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,480
 You guys like, "What is going on over here

628
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,720
 "with the water running?"

629
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
 (audience laughing)

630
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,440
 Does everyone, hey, I'm not moving on

631
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,360
 'til every head in here gets it, okay?

632
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,640
 And I see you, okay?

633
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,560
 Hey, here's the deal.

634
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,320
 In other words, is it half empty or half full?

635
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,160
 Well, it depends.

636
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,480
 If it's emptying, then it's half empty.

637
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,320
 If it's filling up, then it would be half full.

638
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,920
 It depends on what is going in it

639
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,400
 or what is coming out of it.

640
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,520
 Does that make sense?

641
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,020
 How does this have anything to do with gratefulness?

642
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,000
 Some of us inside of the room are master complainers.

643
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,080
 We have mastered the ability to complain about anything.

644
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,800
 And when I say anything, I mean anything.

645
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,480
 And so you're able to drive down the road,

646
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,440
 and instead of being thankful that,

647
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,320
 man, this road is great, and I can't believe it,

648
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,960
 I live in a country like this, and this is amazing,

649
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,800
 you're like, "Oh, my goodness,

650
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,780
 "can everyone just drive the speed limit, please?

651
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,160
 "What are you doing?"

652
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,760
 And you get here, and you park in the car,

653
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,920
 and you're not like, "Wow, this is like,

654
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,180
 "it's an amazing gathering on a Tuesday night

655
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,980
 "that I get to come to, and it's totally free,

656
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,480
 "and I get to hang out and be around friends."

657
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,160
 You show up, and you're like, "Ah, the parking!

658
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,880
 "What is wrong with this church?

659
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,400
 "This is ridiculous, where is the golf cart?

660
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
 "One golf cart for 4,000 people?

661
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,880
 "Is this a joke?"

662
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,840
 I mean, you've mastered the ability

663
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,760
 to complain about anything.

664
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
 I mean, people will complain about the weather,

665
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,600
 and I hear the same thing during different seasons

666
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,700
 from the same person, where it's like,

667
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,000
 "Ah, summer, it's gonna be so hot."

668
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,780
 And then winter comes around, and it's like,

669
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,160
 "Ah, oh, I just hate the cold, I can't stand the cold."

670
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,360
 It's like, up and down, nothing's gonna please you.

671
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,900
 And you say, "I just wish we lived in San Diego,

672
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,200
 "it'd be 72 year round."

673
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
 You know what you would do if you lived in San Diego?

674
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,440
 Man, now I'm just going.

675
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,200
 Okay, if you lived in San Diego,

676
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,800
 you wouldn't be happy with 72, you'd be like,

677
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,640
 "Ah, I wish we had seasons.

678
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,260
 "That's gotta be great to have seasons."

679
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,880
 Because you have mastered the ability

680
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
 to complain about anything.

681
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,640
 It is an art, and many of us have conquered it.

682
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,880
 And it's something that you can,

683
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,800
 just like you can complain about anything,

684
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,560
 there is a way to experience praising or thanking God,

685
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,760
 being grateful about anything.

686
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,840
 And the reason why this illustration is relevant

687
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,840
 is just like in that scenario of complaining.

688
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,720
 How do you know if your life is half empty or half full?

689
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,940
 If you complain, every time you and I complain,

690
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,680
 it's something where it's just sucking the life out,

691
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,600
 sucking the life out.

692
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,440
 Oh, this is so terrible.

693
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,080
 I can't believe my job, I showed up,

694
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,840
 and they're like, "Oh, we got new health insurance,

695
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,000
 "you gotta fill these forms out."

696
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,040
 Can you believe that?

697
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,680
 I'm so, you have health insurance, that's amazing.

698
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,840
 You show up in the food trucks, you're like,

699
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,560
 "No, the slider food trucks aren't here tonight,

700
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,320
 "unbelievable, I'm going home, this is ridiculous.

701
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,280
 "I'm supposed to eat at the piggy pork thing over here?"

702
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,440
 I mean, it's true.

703
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,880
 Where you can complain, and you're draining your life

704
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,700
 every time that you do it.

705
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,840
 Then the flip side is also true.

706
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,240
 Here's what's crazy.

707
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
 It's like you can live a life,

708
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,080
 you can be someone who's not getting complained

709
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,240
 and drained all the time,

710
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,680
 but by being grateful, you will gain all the time.

711
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,720
 In other words, you're gonna come in,

712
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 you're gonna be driving along the road,

713
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,600
 you're gonna be like, "Man, I'm sitting in traffic.

714
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,120
 "Gosh, Lord, thank you that there are people all around me."

715
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,280
 Which means there are lots of people who need Jesus.

716
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,960
 There's a lot of men and women inside of this city,

717
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,320
 and I thank you that there's a chance

718
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,980
 that I get to be a part of connecting them

719
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,820
 to the body of Christ.

720
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,640
 "Thank you that there are food trucks.

721
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,940
 "Slider's not here, so I get to try something new.

722
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,120
 "God, I'm filling it up."

723
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,000
 "Thank you that somebody else called the food trucks."

724
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,320
 I don't even know how to call the food truck,

725
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,360
 but somebody called 'em,

726
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,540
 and they got 'em here to be a part of it.

727
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,300
 "Thank you that at work I have health insurance.

728
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,460
 "Thank you that the weather's hot,

729
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,320
 "'cause it reminds me to be thankful for AC,

730
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,260
 "and it's cold outside.

731
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,600
 "I get to be thankful for the heat."

732
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,140
 That no matter what life throws at you,

733
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,660
 you're able to say, "Man, I am thankful,

734
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,220
 "and my life isn't drained from it,

735
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,060
 "and it gains, and it adds to it."

736
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,080
 Study after study shows what the Bible says,

737
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,720
 which is that if you want to have joy in your life,

738
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,680
 express gratitude.

739
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,920
 In other words, it's not happy, joyful people

740
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,780
 that are thankful.

741
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,600
 Thankful people are joyful,

742
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,060
 and they're able to see,

743
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,380
 in the midst of whatever life throws at them,

744
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,220
 man, God is at work.

745
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,960
 I can choose to be thankful, or don't,

746
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
 and you complain,

747
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,740
 and your life will always be half empty.

748
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,580
 Things will always be,

749
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,400
 "Ah, man, I'm so depressed about this."

750
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,800
 And you're gonna get around other people

751
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
 who will like feed into it,

752
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,300
 and they're like, "Yeah, the sliders.

753
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,140
 "I can't believe that.

754
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,960
 "That was terrible."

755
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,240
 And you're just gonna continue to drain your life,

756
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,900
 and it's funny, and I'm joking,

757
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,500
 but I couldn't be more serious.

758
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,660
 Think about how often you complain,

759
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,080
 and it is sucking the life out of you,

760
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,700
 and God who's there commanded,

761
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,360
 in Philippians chapter two, verse 14,

762
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,600
 "Do everything without grumbling or complaining."

763
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,920
 It's the same word there.

764
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,120
 That you were to do everything in life

765
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,240
 without ever complaining,

766
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,920
 which is like everything, Paul,

767
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,100
 that feels a little aggressive.

768
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,240
 What about when the power's out?

769
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,880
 Everything in life,

770
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,600
 Paul would say, without complaining.

771
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,700
 And he would say, in 1 Thessalonians,

772
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,460
 what we read earlier,

773
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,420
 "Give thanks in every circumstance,

774
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,120
 "for this is God's will for you."

775
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,960
 What is God's will?

776
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
 That is crazy.

777
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,160
 That was so convicting to me,

778
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,240
 as candidly somebody who just was so frustrated

779
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
 by all the different things for the past two days.

780
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,080
 I wonder about God's will for my life,

781
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,920
 and where does he want me,

782
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,940
 and what's the future hold for us?

783
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,320
 And then you read verses like this,

784
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,840
 and it's like, oh, this is God's will.

785
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,360
 Be thankful in every circumstance.

786
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,460
 That he doesn't say be thankful for every circumstance,

787
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,660
 but he says, hey, you can choose to be thankful

788
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,740
 in every circumstance,

789
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,180
 in the midst of whatever you're walking through.

790
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,840
 If you are a follower of Jesus,

791
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,220
 in the midst of whatever you're walking through,

792
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,040
 you can be thankful,

793
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,180
 knowing that God's promised to work everything

794
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,380
 together for your good.

795
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,220
 That whatever you're facing,

796
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,500
 he's more than enough to get you through.

797
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,300
 There's a list of things that you can,

798
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,780
 in the midst of whatever you're walking through,

799
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,620
 whatever you're facing,

800
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,940
 you can be thankful, Paul would say,

801
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,780
 in your command.

802
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,600
 So here's what we're gonna do.

803
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,460
 We're gonna practice this really quick.

804
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,960
 Everyone take out their phone.

805
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,260
 On your phone, hopefully you have text messaging,

806
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,820
 hopefully it works.

807
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,220
 We're gonna right now take a chance.

808
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,620
 I want everyone to text someone

809
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,300
 and say thank you for something.

810
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,220
 We're just gonna do it right now.

811
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,500
 We're all gonna try it together.

812
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,060
 Some of you maybe have never done this before,

813
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,300
 so let me try it,

814
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,860
 and let me get your head start on it.

815
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,380
 I'm gonna give you the first three words,

816
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,020
 and you got it from there.

817
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,760
 Thank you for.

818
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,700
 Thank you for.

819
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,800
 Don't text the person right next to you.

820
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,040
 Just turn to them and say thank you for.

821
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,700
 And if you get text message from somebody right next to you,

822
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,980
 I need you to raise your hand,

823
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,740
 'cause we're putting their head under the bucket.

824
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,260
 And we're all gonna, I mean it, right now.

825
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,860
 Here, I'm gonna do it right now.

826
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:11,440
 (gentle music)

827
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,440
 (audience laughing)

828
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,020
 (gentle music)

829
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,020
 (audience laughing)

830
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:46,720
 I didn't mind.

831
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,040
 This shouldn't take too much longer.

832
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,240
 Unless you're that novel person.

833
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,840
 We all have that person in our life.

834
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,640
 All right, that's it.

835
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,160
 All right, hey, now here's the next thing.

836
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 I wanna give a chance to do that and express to God.

837
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,320
 There are a billion things we should be thankful for

838
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,160
 that we take for granted.

839
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
 So right now, let's just pray,

840
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,320
 and wherever you're at right now,

841
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
 just pray thank you God for X.

842
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,820
 (congregation murmuring)

843
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:41,240
 Amen.

844
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,480
 If you're here tonight, you're here for the first time,

845
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,400
 we do this every week, and no, that's not true.

846
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,720
 But the point of that practice is just to begin,

847
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,640
 like if you and I will begin to take those steps,

848
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,440
 gratefulness is like this contagious thing.

849
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,800
 It grows and grows and grows inside of your heart.

850
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,960
 And the opposite is true.

851
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,800
 Discontentment, complaining, envy, those things will grow,

852
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,600
 and you can combat them.

853
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,240
 There's a lot of positive moods

854
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,720
 and a lot of negative moods.

855
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,040
 Gratefulness is one of those moods

856
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,200
 that can pull you out of some of the negative moods.

857
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,640
 God created it that way.

858
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,480
 He created you to praise and to thank people,

859
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,520
 to praise Him and thank others,

860
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,360
 live in that relationship with Him

861
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,320
 and relationship with others.

862
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,640
 The final component of having a gratefulness mark your life

863
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,400
 is really looking at the origin

864
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,360
 of where gratefulness comes from.

865
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,120
 It's this gratefulness flows from the right perspective.

866
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,480
 I mentioned this earlier,

867
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,100
 but what did Jesus do for this man

868
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,840
 that He didn't do for the other nine?

869
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,840
 Like we said earlier, He looks at him and He says,

870
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,760
 "Hey, your faith has made you well."

871
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,220
 What a weird sentence.

872
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,000
 What are you saying there, Jesus?

873
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
 Your faith has made you well?

874
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,320
 Well, what about the other nine?

875
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,880
 Did their faith make them well?

876
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,960
 Clearly, there's something different that happened here.

877
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,200
 Like we said, in a moment of clarity,

878
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,600
 this man had the right perspective on who Jesus was,

879
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
 and it says he threw himself at Jesus' feet

880
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,860
 and he began to praise God.

881
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,440
 He saw this man as the Savior that he was,

882
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,660
 that he had the right perspective

883
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,500
 and it fueled a gratefulness in his life.

884
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,860
 If you're gonna have not a momentary,

885
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,580
 a fleeting kind of thank you, Lord, for this day

886
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,360
 and for this food and bless us, amen,

887
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,520
 but if you're gonna have a gratefulness

888
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,960
 that really marks your life continually,

889
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,380
 no matter what you face in every circumstance,

890
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,540
 it's gonna flow from the right perspective.

891
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,320
 What is the right perspective?

892
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,180
 It's a perspective that comes

893
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,600
 from having the right perspective

894
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,340
 or way that you see Jesus

895
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,580
 and the way that you see this life,

896
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,080
 the way that you see eternity.

897
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,260
 I'll explain what I mean,

898
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,860
 but let me give you an example of a guy

899
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,380
 who had the right perspective.

900
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,620
 The way that he saw our world

901
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,720
 because of who he saw Jesus was

902
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,740
 and who Jesus was to him transformed the way

903
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,980
 that he thought about his time,

904
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,740
 about his life, about his stuff.

905
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,700
 It's a guy named Matthew Henry.

906
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,340
 He was a famous theologian from the 1600s,

907
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,300
 lived in England.

908
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,420
 He was basically a well-known celebrity,

909
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,520
 think Billy Graham of the 1600s in England.

910
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,860
 And he's walking home one day

911
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,120
 and he just finished work.

912
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,500
 And on his way home from work,

913
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,300
 he gets robbed by a bunch of people.

914
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,260
 And they take everything that he has.

915
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,540
 And he goes home and he journals out

916
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,140
 and begins to thank God.

917
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,380
 And you're like, what are you thanking God for

918
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,020
 after you just got robbed

919
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,780
 and they took all of your money?

920
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
 Here's what he says.

921
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,340
 I thank you God that I've never been robbed before.

922
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,180
 Thank you that although they took my wallet,

923
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,540
 they didn't take my life.

924
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,560
 Thank you that although they took all that I had,

925
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,220
 all that I had was not very much.

926
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,220
 Thank you that it was I who was robbed

927
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,920
 and not I who did the robbing.

928
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,580
 Matthew Henry's right perspective allowed him

929
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,700
 even in the midst of getting robbed,

930
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,820
 hey, I can name four things right off the bat

931
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,880
 I'm thankful for.

932
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,180
 How crazy is that?

933
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,460
 Well, it's only crazy if you don't see it

934
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,740
 through the perspective that Matthew Henry

935
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,900
 saw it through.

936
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,780
 The perspective that, hey, Jesus is the savior of my life,

937
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,260
 which means everything that I've ever done

938
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,500
 inside of this life has been paid for on the cross.

939
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,700
 He took my place so that I wouldn't have to go to hell.

940
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,860
 And so now I get to spend whatever time I have left

941
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,700
 on this earth trying to make him as famous as possible

942
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,940
 and reach as many lost people as possible

943
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
 for the name of Jesus

944
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,240
 so that they don't have to go to hell either.

945
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,540
 That right perspective, I mean, think about the power

946
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,060
 of just the fact that if you're a Christian,

947
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,500
 you don't have to go to hell.

948
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,560
 I mean, that should be enough.

949
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,640
 It's crazy to even, I'm embarrassed to even be like,

950
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,780
 that should be enough as though like we even need

951
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,080
 to be reminded of that, but I know I do.

952
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,960
 Like if God never did another thing for the rest of my life,

953
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,640
 that should be enough that I don't have to go to hell

954
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,580
 forever and ever and ever and ever.

955
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,460
 I mean, think about it.

956
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,500
 Like if you're a Christian in the room,

957
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,060
 I want you to think about something with me.

958
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,680
 Imagine you didn't know Jesus and it's true.

959
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,780
 There's a hell and anyone who's not put their faith

960
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,940
 in Jesus and what he did on the cross

961
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,400
 as the payment for their sin.

962
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,020
 And he rose from the dead showing that payment cleared,

963
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,420
 the check cleared, the credit card went through.

964
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,660
 That's what Jesus showed whenever he rose from the dead.

965
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,060
 There's a hell and anyone who doesn't have a relationship

966
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,160
 with him is going there and think about it.

967
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,680
 Think about where you would be

968
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,720
 if you didn't have the relationship.

969
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,040
 Think about hell.

970
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,520
 I know that's a bizarre thing to think about.

971
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,680
 Spending eternity away from the living God,

972
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,840
 having no relationships around you in eternal torment.

973
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,120
 And maybe it's been so long you were a kid

974
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,960
 when you got saved.

975
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,920
 Think about that.

976
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,760
 That's what you deserve.

977
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,600
 That's what I deserve.

978
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,600
 It's what every person who's alive on this planet deserves.

979
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,000
 By sinning against a perfect holy God

980
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,160
 and choosing to be their own God.

981
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,880
 And apart from God, stepping into your life

982
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,360
 and dropping the veil from your eyes

983
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,760
 and allowing you to see Jesus.

984
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,320
 'Cause if you are a follower of Jesus,

985
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,520
 it's not 'cause you chose him, he chose you.

986
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,420
 And so you can clap at that.

987
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,600
 But here, think about that.

988
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,200
 How could we not be the most grateful people on the planet?

989
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
 I mean, if you don't ever get married,

990
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,740
 if you're out there and you're like,

991
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,040
 oh man, I'm still single, I'm just so frustrated by that

992
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,880
 and it's draining your life.

993
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,440
 The God who's there has saved you.

994
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,260
 If you are a Christian,

995
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,760
 you're not gonna spend eternity apart from him.

996
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,840
 Everything else is just sprinkles on top.

997
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,320
 And the God who's there is saying,

998
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
 this is the right perspective to have.

999
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
 And if you don't have it,

1000
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
 in the moments that I don't have it,

1001
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,120
 or if I don't have it,

1002
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,360
 I'm living less than in line

1003
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,660
 with the will of God for my life.

1004
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,840
 This life is a vapor, the scripture says.

1005
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,680
 Whatever expectations, whatever frustrations,

1006
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,800
 whatever things in your life

1007
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,600
 that you're just so upset about and you complain about,

1008
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
 and we all have them.

1009
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,500
 God would say, when you could see it

1010
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,000
 from an eternal right perspective,

1011
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,400
 those things will fade away.

1012
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 And the moment you begin to see it,

1013
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,480
 like Matthew, Henry saw it,

1014
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,000
 like Jesus calls us to see it

1015
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,560
 with a right perspective, it fuels gratefulness.

1016
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,080
 Everything I have is a gift.

1017
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,960
 I get another day, what?

1018
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,600
 I get another chance to have relationships with friends.

1019
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,440
 Yeah, I'm single, but that means I'm still alive

1020
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,160
 and I still got time to mingle and I'm gonna be here

1021
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,200
 and I'm gonna have relationships maybe around me,

1022
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,320
 maybe there's still hope.

1023
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,120
 Everything I have, there's a chance I can turn it around.

1024
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,040
 There's a chance that I can see

1025
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,440
 that God's in the work of all of it.

1026
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,880
 Even the worst of circumstances, scripture says,

1027
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,720
 he has promised.

1028
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,360
 If you are a believer, listen to me very closely

1029
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,840
 'cause some of you that are listening right now,

1030
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
 wherever you're at, you're listening online,

1031
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
 or you're listening in this room,

1032
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,120
 you are wondering how can God make cancer make sense?

1033
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,440
 How can God make the most painful

1034
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,860
 of circumstances make sense?

1035
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,960
 And I'm not gonna pretend like I know all the answers

1036
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,560
 and know everything that you're walking through

1037
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,380
 and could give you like,

1038
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,640
 well, here's exactly what's going on there

1039
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,960
 'cause I don't know.

1040
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,160
 But I know that he has promised

1041
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,040
 that everything that you face, everything you experience,

1042
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,800
 I will use for your good.

1043
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,040
 And you're gonna have a chance.

1044
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,840
 Someday, you're gonna stand before God

1045
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
 and you're gonna stand in front of him

1046
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,000
 and you're gonna get to see how everything

1047
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,520
 that was so broken in this world,

1048
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,160
 he was using to bring together for good.

1049
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,880
 So in the midst of the worst circumstances,

1050
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,760
 we can thank God and say, thank you, God,

1051
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,400
 that even though this is not what I would choose,

1052
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,880
 it's not what I would want,

1053
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,720
 you are gonna use it for good.

1054
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,440
 And though I can't see it now, I'll see it someday.

1055
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,880
 And I'm gonna trust you until then.

1056
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,240
 Will you help me thank you?

1057
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,900
 Help me to see it clearly, see you clearly.

1058
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,200
 See the gifts that are all around me that I do not deserve.

1059
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,600
 If you're in the room and you have never trusted in Jesus,

1060
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,720
 here's what you need to know.

1061
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,000
 No amount of thankfulness that you express

1062
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,160
 is gonna change your life in the most important way

1063
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,080
 that is possible.

1064
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,560
 Every expression of thanks, you can apply them,

1065
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,920
 it'll probably make your life better,

1066
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,040
 but you're still going to hell.

1067
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,760
 And the God who's there is crazy about you.

1068
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,000
 He loves you, he gave his life for you.

1069
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
 He gave his life for anyone

1070
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,640
 who would simply receive the free gift.

1071
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,000
 How do you become a Christian?

1072
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,040
 How do you have eternal life?

1073
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,160
 Let me make it really clear in case you've been tuning out

1074
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,000
 and counting these wood things,

1075
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,040
 like how do they get those up there?

1076
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,320
 In case you're not zoning in, take it right here.

1077
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,320
 You put your faith or your trust in Jesus' work on the cross.

1078
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,960
 You died in my place, you rose in my place.

1079
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,160
 You gave your life so that I didn't have to give my life

1080
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,280
 for all of eternity.

1081
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,920
 You gave your eternal life, Jesus,

1082
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,920
 so I don't have to give all of my eternity away

1083
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,800
 apart from you.

1084
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,280
 And I'm not gonna trust, listen to me,

1085
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,520
 listen, listen, listen.

1086
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,260
 I will not trust in how good of a person I am.

1087
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,400
 The Bible does not say,

1088
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,800
 "Whosoever behaves shall not perish,

1089
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
 "but have eternal life."

1090
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,240
 It says, "Whosoever believes,"

1091
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
 whoever trusts in Jesus,

1092
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,680
 whoever says, "I'm not getting into heaven

1093
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,800
 "because I went to church enough."

1094
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
 That's a lie.

1095
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,720
 Whoever says, "I am only gonna be granted access

1096
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,140
 "with the one God who's there because of Jesus,

1097
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,560
 "because he opened the door, he called himself the door,

1098
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,500
 "he died in my place,

1099
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,020
 "and I have so much to be thankful for

1100
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,160
 "'cause I don't deserve it, I didn't earn it,

1101
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,580
 "and yet Jesus stepped in

1102
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,240
 "and he allowed me to have eternal life."

1103
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
 That's what it means to be a Christian.

1104
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,960
 If you're in the room, maybe you're walking,

1105
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,820
 you haven't walked in your faith for a while,

1106
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,520
 maybe it's first time back in church or ever,

1107
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,720
 if you have never accepted that free gift,

1108
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,880
 you're not a Christian.

1109
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,040
 And I don't know how to encourage you

1110
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,640
 to be grateful in this life

1111
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,000
 'cause this world is as good

1112
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,600
 as it's ever gonna get for you.

1113
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,640
 And then off to eternity forever and ever and ever,

1114
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,760
 apart from the one true God who's crazy in love with you.

1115
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,320
 You look at your life like I look at mine

1116
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,720
 and you're like, "Gosh, could anyone love me?"

1117
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,500
 And the God who's there is crazy in love with you.

1118
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,680
 And the lie that you're gonna be tempted every day

1119
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,600
 to believe and have been tempted every day to believe

1120
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,760
 is that he doesn't love you.

1121
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,800
 And he's already proven emphatically that he does

1122
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,500
 by giving his life on your behalf.

1123
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,380
 And it's the moment that you say,

1124
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,040
 "Man, it's not good people in heaven,

1125
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,840
 "bad people in hell, forgiven people go to heaven."

1126
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,220
 And the only way to get that is by saying,

1127
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,900
 "Jesus, your payment was enough.

1128
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,460
 "You paid for everything I did, I don't deserve it.

1129
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,940
 "You paid for it, and I'm so grateful."

1130
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,120
 Let me pray.

1131
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,040
 Father, I pray that anyone in this room

1132
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,180
 who's never had a moment of faith

1133
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,040
 where they accepted that free gift right now

1134
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,840
 where they're sitting, would accept the free gift

1135
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,400
 that you offered when you gave your life on their behalf.

1136
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,300
 And that payment was more than enough,

1137
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,160
 and it went through and the curse broke.

1138
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,560
 And since that moment, everything has begun to change.

1139
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,800
 Many of us have begun to change,

1140
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,320
 and our world as it is will change.

1141
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,520
 I pray that right now, anyone who's never,

1142
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,960
 currently is trusting in how good of a person they are,

1143
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,800
 or they think you wouldn't love them

1144
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,080
 because of how bad of a person they've been,

1145
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,200
 your spirit would do what only it can do,

1146
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,860
 convince them that that is a lie.

1147
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,120
 And you've already paid the way,

1148
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,800
 you've opened the door for anyone

1149
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,640
 who will simply walk through it, and we are grateful, God.

1150
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,880
 At the end of the day, we are unworthy servants,

1151
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,640
 we are unworthy of the gift that you've offered.

1152
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,460
 So right now, Lord, as we sing this song,

1153
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,640
 would you, in our hearts, in my heart, start with me first.

1154
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,080
 Kindle a gratefulness that continually

1155
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,780
 sees every moment I have is just a gift, God.

1156
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,540
 Everything in front of me is a gift that I didn't earn,

1157
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,320
 and I don't deserve.

1158
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,960
 We worship you in song now, amen.

1159
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,460
 (eerie music)
