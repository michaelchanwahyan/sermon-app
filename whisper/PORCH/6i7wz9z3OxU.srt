1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,620
 - All right, well hey, welcome everybody in the room,

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,860
 everybody tuning in online.

4
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,000
 At all of the Ports Live locations,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,540
 we are kicking off a brand new series tonight

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,860
 that we are so excited about and praying God uses

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,580
 to address a really big need in this era,

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,340
 and that is on mental health and anxiety.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,520
 And so for the next handful of weeks,

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,620
 we're gonna walk through what God's word has to say.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,460
 But let me start with a story

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,940
 that'll give us some tracks for where we're going.

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,540
 A couple of years ago, I was speaking at College Station

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,540
 at a ministry called Breakaway, which is an amazing ministry.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,020
 And I had committed to speak,

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,900
 and that's on a Tuesday night at 9 p.m.,

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,320
 three and a half hours away, if you're not from Texas.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,740
 And the problem was I had also committed to speak

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,820
 the next morning in Dallas, Texas at 8.30 a.m.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,180
 Now, I realized this and began assuming,

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,500
 oh, I'll just drive back late

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,020
 after Breakaway gets done at like midnight.

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,900
 And then I did the math and realized

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,020
 I wouldn't get to bed till 3.30 or 4.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,940
 Now, I don't know about you,

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,420
 there's people that can run without sleep.

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,620
 I'm not one of those people.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,380
 I like a good seven, eight hours a night.

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,220
 And if I get any less than that,

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,020
 if I'm gonna speak in front of crowds,

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,820
 it's hard for me to put sentences together.

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,660
 And so I am seeing just, oh, this is not a good plan.

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,940
 And so I am running through, should I cancel one of them?

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,100
 What should I do?

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,580
 And then it hits me.

36
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,920
 A friend of mine, a couple of friends of mine,

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,540
 had recently started a private plane business

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,780
 where they charted out private flights.

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,900
 And this is not really my world, not really my thing,

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,000
 but I picked up the phone, you know, shoot your shot.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,220
 And I was like, hey, if I was gonna use that plane,

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,580
 what would it cost or how much would it charge?

43
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,860
 And I actually knew the pilot too.

44
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,980
 And he said, if you cover the price of jet fuel,

45
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,220
 you can use it.

46
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,800
 And so I got some of my friends together in my community

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,700
 and they joined and we just divided and conquered

48
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,560
 or divided the costs.

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,580
 And so, man, everything problem solved.

50
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,100
 We would fly in that night and then fly back out.

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,300
 Like we were, you know, rock stars in Coldplay or something.

52
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,300
 And the day came, got to the airport, got on the plane,

53
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,580
 everything was going fine.

54
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,300
 And then we took off.

55
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,300
 And I quickly realized a few things

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,780
 that I hadn't anticipated.

57
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,800
 This was not Air Force One by any means.

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,980
 There was a reason why he was like, just cover the fuel.

59
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,820
 It was like a plane from the late 70s or the 80s.

60
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,720
 It was tiny, it was cramped.

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,860
 And that becomes really important,

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,100
 the size or a very small two propeller plane,

63
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,160
 because it was also dense fog and storming outside.

64
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
 And so I couldn't see anything around me.

65
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,860
 You're looking outside of the passenger window

66
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,820
 and it storms everywhere.

67
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,520
 And if all of that wasn't bad enough, I also knew the pilot.

68
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,260
 Now, here's why that's a problem

69
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,000
 you probably have never thought about.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,780
 There are certain professions that when they interact

71
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,000
 with your life, ignorance really is bliss.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,540
 If you're having heart surgery, you don't want to know,

73
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,860
 you know, the heart surgeon was your fraternity buddy,

74
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,060
 Frank the Tank, who barely graduated.

75
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,620
 You want to assume he graduated, you know, magna cum laude

76
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,380
 and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last year.

77
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,900
 And the pilot is also one of those situations

78
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,380
 where Mark was his name and he's awesome,

79
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,340
 but he's also kind of a little crazy.

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,620
 And he would always joke about like,

81
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,900
 man, I don't know what I'm doing up here.

82
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,340
 The first time flying and you're like,

83
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,700
 okay, it's not a good joke, man.

84
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,180
 There's a lot of storms outside.

85
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,740
 And he, on top of all of that,

86
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,420
 he had just recently left ministry

87
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,900
 to go and help run this plane.

88
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,780
 So I'm like, bro, you've been doing this like an hour.

89
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,780
 And he had nine fingers, story for another time.

90
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,540
 But in the moment you're like, oh man,

91
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,300
 but there's at least 10 buttons up there,

92
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,540
 I know, on this plane.

93
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,320
 And so it's storming and I can feel every up and down

94
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,700
 as we're flying here with these guys.

95
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,940
 And I'm like, oh man, this is how I go out.

96
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,740
 I'm going to die at the hands of nine finger Mark

97
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,100
 and my kids, you just run a worst case scenario

98
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,260
 when anxiety hits and I'm walking through like,

99
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
 who's going to teach my son how to throw the ball?

100
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,460
 Who's going to walk my daughter down the aisle?

101
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,860
 And just all of those thoughts internally that,

102
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,300
 people around you may not even realize,

103
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,940
 but they're just where anxiety has taken over.

104
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
 Now, irony of ironies,

105
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,640
 I was flying to college station to teach on anxiety.

106
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,060
 I'm like, I'm a total hypocrite.

107
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,560
 I'm going to die in this plane.

108
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,660
 But it was one of those moments when anxiety

109
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,180
 just grabs you, strikes.

110
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,060
 And what do you do in those moments?

111
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,460
 This is a question that is increasingly important

112
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,500
 because anxiety, when it strikes in that moment,

113
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,880
 you and I have a choice,

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,740
 not over whether we're going to have anxious thoughts

115
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,420
 or feelings, but what we do with those.

116
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,820
 And as a society, we are not great

117
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,180
 when it comes to coping with anxiety.

118
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,220
 In part, because of the enormous rates

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,140
 at which it is impacting so much in so many of our lives

120
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,700
 and COVID didn't help that.

121
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,720
 In fact, recent studies from the CDC have shown

122
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,720
 that 63% of young people ages between 18, 30

123
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,940
 are suffering from significant symptoms

124
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,380
 of anxiety or depression.

125
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,060
 Nearly a quarter of respondents reported

126
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,400
 that they had started or increased the abuse of substances,

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,660
 including alcohol, marijuana, prescription drugs,

128
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,400
 to cope with their anxiety.

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,900
 In June, 2020, CDC released data that suggests

130
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,720
 one in four young adults had considered suicide.

131
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,860
 Here's a slide that shows the incredible growth

132
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,740
 that happened from 2019 and the rates of adults reported

133
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,060
 with symptoms of anxiety disorder

134
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,500
 and the impact COVID has had.

135
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,100
 It's just exploded.

136
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,700
 America is by far the most anxious nation on the planet

137
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,660
 before a pandemic, and it hasn't gotten any worse.

138
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,420
 And in particular, it's only gotten worse

139
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,240
 among young adults.

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,900
 Here's the age breakdown of people

141
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,700
 that have reported symptoms of anxiety disorders.

142
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,000
 The largest two buckets being 18 to 24,

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,360
 and we can safely assume the 25 to 49

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,360
 is likely more than 25 to 35 in there.

145
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
 And so anxiety is not just a problem,

146
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,980
 it's a problem that's getting increasingly worse.

147
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,000
 And young adulthood is a time in life

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,400
 where there is so much change happening,

149
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,680
 it makes all the sense in the world

150
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,820
 that you would be anxious.

151
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,940
 What do I mean?

152
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
 Well, prior to this stage in life,

153
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,100
 everything was pretty clearly mapped out for you,

154
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,720
 if you think about it.

155
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,620
 Like, remember, you're in first grade

156
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,320
 and the tracks were laid out.

157
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,660
 Where do you go after first?

158
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,640
 Second grade.

159
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,480
 Where do you go after that?

160
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,360
 Third.

161
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,520
 Where do you go after middle school?

162
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,600
 High school.

163
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,320
 There's this clear path and track.

164
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,280
 Where do you go after high school?

165
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,000
 Freshman year, sophomore year, junior year, senior year.

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,880
 And then it's like the tracks run out

167
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,840
 and ah, free fall, as there isn't a clear,

168
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,680
 what is the next step?

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,380
 And a lot of people don't have wise people in their life

170
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,220
 to help them know, like,

171
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,880
 what am I supposed to do with my life?

172
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,800
 Am I in the right job?

173
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,680
 Am I dating the person that I'm supposed to marry?

174
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,240
 How am I gonna afford to pay off my student loans?

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,760
 And it becomes this free fall

176
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,480
 that is a breeding ground for anxiety.

177
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,560
 Makes all the sense in the world.

178
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,620
 Which is why this is one of the most anxious times,

179
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,640
 or anxious time periods in life.

180
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,500
 And on top of all of that,

181
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,700
 just to validate a little bit more,

182
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,160
 the average age of marriage in the last 20 or 30 years

183
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,440
 has gone from around the age of 24 and 23 to 30 and 29.

184
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
 Which means most of us are walking through

185
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,920
 the most anxious time in our life all alone.

186
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,080
 Which further contributes to anxiety.

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,500
 And so we're doing this series

188
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,400
 because we wanna help address such a huge issue.

189
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,560
 And candidly, I think that the church

190
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,480
 has done a really poor job at handling this subject.

191
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,640
 And here's what I mean.

192
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,080
 Intentionally or unintentionally,

193
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
 a lot of people have communicated

194
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
 that what the Bible says and what Christians believe

195
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,760
 is that when it comes to anxiety, you should just stop.

196
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,360
 If you were to ask the average Christian,

197
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,520
 hey, what do you think the Bible teaches about it?

198
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,920
 They have either been misinformed

199
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,880
 or are uninformed what the Bible actually teaches.

200
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,820
 So they assume it's just like,

201
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,000
 hey, just stop or have more faith.

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,960
 Which doesn't help.

203
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,360
 In other words, if saying, hey, stop it,

204
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,520
 actually worked, you would have just stopped.

205
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,360
 It's not helpful.

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
 It's like telling someone who can't fall asleep

207
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,840
 or struggling to fall asleep, hey, just fall asleep.

208
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,400
 And you're like, oh, thanks for the advice.

209
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,080
 And the same is true with anxiety.

210
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,160
 And tragically, that idea of the Bible just saying,

211
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
 hey, just stop or just pray,

212
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,320
 fails so largely

213
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,160
 to communicate what the Bible actually teaches.

214
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,400
 And so I wanna walk through and help connect the dots

215
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,800
 on some of what the Bible teaches

216
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,460
 as it relates to fighting anxiety,

217
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,800
 because here's what's true.

218
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,040
 For Christians, I'm talking to Christians,

219
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
 our first line of defense

220
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
 when it comes to battling anxiety, worry, fear,

221
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
 is always God's word.

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,040
 That doesn't mean that things like counseling

223
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,460
 or medication or things outside of that,

224
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,440
 there's no place for it.

225
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,140
 Those are wonderful fields, incredible.

226
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,080
 My wife is a licensed counselor.

227
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,660
 I have personally benefited deeply from counseling.

228
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,500
 But for Christians, it does mean anything in addition

229
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,620
 to God's word is a supplement, not a replacement.

230
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,220
 The Bible is our first line of defense.

231
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,800
 And I think the church has not taught

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,340
 what the Bible actually teaches,

233
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,600
 which means has not given the first line of defense

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,440
 to followers of Christ.

235
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,340
 So that is the passion around this series

236
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,180
 and around this book,

237
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,180
 because God's word is so much more practical and helpful

238
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,500
 than maybe you have ever realized.

239
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,860
 So tonight we're gonna walk through

240
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,260
 just one of the teachings,

241
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,960
 given 2000 years ago, that is so incredibly brilliant,

242
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,540
 given by the son of God when he walked on this planet,

243
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,020
 talking to a group of people

244
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,020
 who turns out were struggling with anxiety.

245
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,220
 It's been around a long time.

246
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,740
 And Jesus brings up some principles and truths

247
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,980
 that are so relevant to how we

248
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,660
 can experience increasing freedom

249
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,820
 and why everyone in the world is freaking out,

250
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,340
 but why we don't need to.

251
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,820
 So we're gonna be in Matthew chapter six.

252
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,220
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open.

253
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,000
 These may be verses, if you grew up in church,

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,300
 you've heard before and may have never actually heard taught

255
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,020
 in line with what they're saying.

256
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,220
 And we're gonna look at five truths Jesus gives us.

257
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,540
 But before we go there, I wanna define anxiety biblically,

258
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,660
 'cause one of the challenges with this topic

259
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,100
 is people have many associations with words

260
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,220
 like anxiety, worry, fear,

261
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,800
 and then you throw in anxiety disorder,

262
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,220
 generalized anxiety disorder,

263
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,740
 post-traumatic stress disorder.

264
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,180
 And so how do you group

265
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,860
 and what does the Bible have to say about all of those?

266
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,100
 All of those are subjects that we're gonna maybe do a views

267
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,700
 from the porch on or touch at another time.

268
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,380
 Tonight, I wanna focus specifically

269
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,960
 on what the Bible says about anxiety,

270
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,560
 not excluding those other things,

271
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,560
 but I just wanna hone in on what the Bible describes

272
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
 and the terms specifically that it uses

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,380
 when it describes anxiety.

274
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,960
 Because even what I'm about to explain

275
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,960
 will enlighten maybe some of you to go,

276
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,380
 oh, I didn't realize that.

277
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,800
 The word the Bible uses when it says, do not be anxious,

278
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,860
 Philippians chapter four, it says,

279
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,040
 don't be anxious about anything and everything

280
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,980
 through prayer and supplication,

281
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,300
 let your requests be made known to God.

282
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,480
 The same word that is used there

283
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,280
 is the same word that's used in Matthew chapter six,

284
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,720
 that's used in first Peter chapter five,

285
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,000
 used in Luke chapter 12.

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,480
 It's a Greek word, merim now.

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,880
 Now the New Testament is written in Greek.

288
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,800
 This is about to be a little heady,

289
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,840
 try to make it as clear as possible.

290
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,080
 New Testament written in Greek

291
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,240
 and the word that was translated for do not be anxious

292
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,520
 is not Paul saying never have an anxious thought.

293
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,720
 The word merim now is synonymous with meditation.

294
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,560
 So Paul is not saying,

295
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,840
 hey, don't ever have an anxious thought, that's impossible.

296
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,600
 He's saying you can choose not to meditate

297
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,000
 on fearful, anxious thoughts, that is possible.

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,320
 So his definition is meditating on fearful

299
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,100
 and anxious thoughts, which who would disagree with that?

300
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,080
 I've been doing this a long time.

301
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,960
 I've never heard the story of somebody coming up

302
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,800
 saying you don't want to change my life for the better.

303
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,640
 I mean, things were off the rails

304
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,440
 and I decided every morning I'm gonna wake up

305
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,820
 and meditate on everything I'm afraid of.

306
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,780
 Everything possibly that could go wrong that day,

307
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,040
 I'm just gonna rehearse in my mind

308
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,680
 and an asteroid could destroy the planet

309
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
 and there could be another pandemic

310
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,420
 and that made my life better.

311
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,560
 Nobody would disagree with that

312
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
 or nobody would say that it's true.

313
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
 And that's what Paul is saying.

314
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,480
 That's what the Bible teaches.

315
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,800
 You can choose not to meditate

316
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,280
 on fearful and anxious thoughts.

317
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,520
 So as we walk through in this series,

318
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,880
 that's the definition the Bible has.

319
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,200
 So Matthew chapter six, we're gonna look at these five

320
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,160
 things that Jesus lays out for us.

321
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,600
 Verse 25, in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount,

322
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,800
 the most famous sermon he ever preached, he says this.

323
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,

324
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,760
 what you will eat or what you will drink,

325
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,060
 nor about your body, what you will put on.

326
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,080
 So he brings up what they were anxious about.

327
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,000
 And that day there was no refrigeration.

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,280
 Chick-fil-A was not open on Sunday,

329
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,520
 it wouldn't open any day.

330
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,400
 They didn't have the ability to store

331
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,920
 and so being anxious over, are we gonna have enough food

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,560
 to make it through the end of the season was a real thing.

333
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,240
 To us, he would say whatever you're anxious about,

334
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
 it would still apply.

335
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,300
 Don't be anxious about whether you'll be single for forever.

336
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,760
 Don't be anxious about whether or not

337
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
 Instagram will come back online.

338
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,620
 Don't be anxious about whether somebody is gonna ding

339
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,280
 your new car out in the parking lot.

340
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,200
 He's not saying it doesn't matter,

341
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,280
 not saying it doesn't important.

342
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,080
 He's inviting us to a life where you are not marked

343
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,720
 by dwelling on fearful and anxious thoughts.

344
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,180
 And then he asks a question that I think is so profound.

345
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,080
 Isn't life more than food

346
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,640
 and the body more than clothing?

347
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,240
 Now let me get to the point and I'll tell you why

348
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,760
 this is so brilliant, like Jedi Jesus move here.

349
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,560
 The first idea that I wanna highlight from the text

350
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,820
 is to track down your anxiety.

351
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,640
 Stay with me.

352
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:38,040
 Jesus just asked, is all that life is about food

353
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
 and all that, you know, like a body and your life

354
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,920
 is all about food and clothing.

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,120
 Is that the epitome of all life is equal to?

356
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,440
 Why do you think Jesus would ask that question?

357
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,360
 We think about it.

358
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,080
 Well, he's God, so we can assume

359
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,520
 he's not actually asking 'cause he doesn't know the answer.

360
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,880
 In asking that question, his audience would have been forced

361
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,120
 to go, yes, life is more than food.

362
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,240
 In other words, if we knew we had enough food

363
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
 to make it for the rest of our life,

364
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
 would that be the epitome of life?

365
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,500
 No, life is, there's so much more than that.

366
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,960
 I mean, food is important though.

367
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,720
 Yeah, but is life equal food?

368
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,360
 No, of course not.

369
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,560
 To us, he would say, is life not more

370
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,840
 than having a good paying job?

371
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,380
 Is life not more than being married?

372
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,240
 Which, if you get married, you will discover

373
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,500
 it is a lot more than just being married.

374
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,440
 Whatever you would be worried about,

375
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,160
 he would say, isn't life more than that?

376
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
 And in doing so, he forces his audience,

377
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,640
 just like he would with us, to put into a bigger perspective

378
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,760
 the object of the words 'cause they don't know him.

379
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,720
 Of course, life is more than just food.

380
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,520
 And he does what counselors still do today

381
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,400
 in asking questions to help them more clearly see

382
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,320
 what they're anxious about.

383
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,960
 If life is about way more than just having enough food,

384
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,340
 why would you give so much of your life

385
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,120
 to being anxious about it?

386
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,380
 Counselors, like I said, today will still do

387
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,220
 the same thing.

388
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,260
 If you go see him, this is about to be $150 an hour

389
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,300
 right now for free for you people.

390
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,980
 And you were anxious about, your roommate is getting married

391
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,420
 and you're not sure who's gonna live with you

392
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,940
 whenever they move out.

393
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,300
 You're anxious over, man, I don't know anybody

394
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,500
 to look for a roommate and I'm anxious about that.

395
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,580
 And you were sharing this with the counselor.

396
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,060
 They would do what Jesus did, ask questions

397
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,700
 and try to deflate some of that power

398
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,680
 and go, well, what happens if you can't find somebody

399
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,840
 to live with you after they move out?

400
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,340
 You go, well, I wouldn't be able to afford rent.

401
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,900
 I'd have to move out.

402
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,200
 What happens if you have to move out?

403
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,240
 Well, I'd have to move back in with my parents.

404
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
 What happens if you have to move back in

405
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
 with your parents?

406
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,840
 I would feel like just a failure and I'd be embarrassed

407
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,680
 about what other people think 'cause I'm living with my mom

408
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
 and she's changed totally my room

409
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,520
 and that would be uncomfortable.

410
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,160
 Oh, great, okay, you're anxious.

411
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,800
 About what other people think.

412
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,460
 You think you're anxious just about finding a roommate

413
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,340
 and when you drill down and track down your anxiety,

414
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
 you're really anxious about what other people think.

415
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,400
 Now, does that make the problem go away?

416
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,080
 No, but it is the first step in order to fight your anxiety.

417
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,020
 You've got a face, what are you actually anxious about?

418
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,740
 Let me give you some advice that may seem

419
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,220
 very unconventional but is a reflection

420
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,020
 of exactly what Jesus is doing

421
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,660
 by helping them more clearly see their anxiety.

422
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,220
 Anxiety comes in the form often

423
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,220
 of asking a specific question.

424
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,320
 What if?

425
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,380
 It feeds off of what if.

426
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,160
 What if I don't ever get a promotion?

427
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,140
 What if my mom's cancer treatment doesn't work?

428
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,220
 What if I am single for forever?

429
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,600
 What if I did leave my wallet out in the lobby?

430
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,740
 What if?

431
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,420
 And it leaves you there and it asks that question

432
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,500
 but we never answer the question.

433
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,060
 We just hang in that oh my gosh, that would be

434
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,460
 oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

435
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,040
 I wanna encourage you, answer the question.

436
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,940
 Is that gonna make it go away?

437
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,500
 No, we're gonna get to the next step

438
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,860
 but track down your anxiety.

439
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,040
 What if I'm single for forever?

440
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,580
 What if?

441
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,920
 Then what?

442
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,300
 What if?

443
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,240
 If I am single or what if the relationship doesn't work out?

444
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,580
 In other words, I'm suggesting an equation

445
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,000
 to begin to apply and the third part of the equation

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,240
 I'm gonna give in a second but what if?

447
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,920
 What if the relationship you're in doesn't work out?

448
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,620
 Answer it.

449
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,340
 Whatever you're anxious about, answer it.

450
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,100
 What if it doesn't work out?

451
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,380
 Then I would either marry someone else

452
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,020
 or maybe not get married.

453
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,900
 What if you don't get married?

454
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,340
 Then I would be single for forever.

455
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,960
 What if the cancer treatment doesn't work?

456
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,140
 Then my mom may pass away and that really sucks.

457
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,960
 And that's true.

458
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,640
 But anxiety feeds off of ignorance

459
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,600
 and not being willing to face those fears

460
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,200
 and look them in the eye and see them for what they are

461
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,920
 because when we do that, we're able to deflate the power

462
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,160
 by applying what Jesus is about to say next

463
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,720
 but the equation is what if?

464
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,620
 Then I would.

465
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,200
 It could be something really small.

466
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,780
 What if your car breaks down

467
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,320
 and you can't afford to get it fixed?

468
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,980
 Then I would have to figure out

469
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,780
 another mode of transportation.

470
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,020
 It's silly or maybe even simple as that seems,

471
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,460
 so few people actually track down

472
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,020
 and chase down their anxiety

473
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,780
 and so they hang in this fog of fear

474
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,700
 rather than isolating and identifying

475
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,420
 this is exactly what I'm afraid of and facing it

476
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,540
 which is the first step in order to change it.

477
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,540
 And Jesus brilliantly points out,

478
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,100
 man, you think life is all about fear.

479
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,840
 Life, you know in your heart, you understand,

480
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
 life is so much more than that.

481
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,160
 Trying to deflate the power of their worries

482
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,520
 'cause inside of that fog, the anxiety,

483
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,280
 whenever we don't pinpoint it and isolate it,

484
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,160
 it's so much bigger than it really is

485
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,680
 or we just kind of loom and never get to the bottom of it.

486
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,080
 It's not just similar to this or similar to this.

487
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,640
 There's a study I read that said

488
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,200
 that a single glass of water is responsible

489
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,800
 for seven blocks in a city wide

490
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,240
 of 100 feet tall fog.

491
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,560
 If you go to New York and you see fog out in the day,

492
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,360
 a single glass of water gets expanded and stretched

493
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,400
 and is responsible and can make

494
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,180
 seven city blocks 100 feet deep.

495
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,960
 In a similar way, this is what anxiety does

496
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,220
 inside of our minds unless we pinpoint it and isolate it

497
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,760
 and look at it directly.

498
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
 It just stretches it and stretches it and stretches it

499
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,200
 and that fog of fear gets as big as it can.

500
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,040
 And part of the way that you see it, not as a huge fog,

501
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,200
 but as a glass of water, which doesn't make it go away,

502
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,800
 it's still there, it just deflates the power,

503
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,040
 is by tracking down your anxiety.

504
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,580
 And then Jesus gives us the most important part

505
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,440
 of that equation.

506
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,520
 What if, and you're gonna answer it,

507
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,760
 then I would, and he goes to the most important thing

508
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,200
 to focus on, but God will.

509
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,360
 What if, then I would, but God will.

510
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,200
 Here's where he goes at.

511
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
 Jesus says this, look at the birds of the air.

512
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,640
 So they're outside, birds fly over.

513
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,000
 Jesus said, check out those birds.

514
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,120
 They neither sow nor reap, basically plant

515
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,560
 and harvest crops, to gather into barns,

516
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,000
 and yet God feeds them.

517
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,640
 Are you not more valuable than a bird?

518
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
 And why are you anxious about clothing?

519
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,000
 Consider the lilies of the field.

520
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,560
 So he points to some flowers, how they grow.

521
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,120
 They neither toil nor spin.

522
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
 Yet I tell you, even Solomon in all of his glory

523
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,200
 was not dressed like one of these.

524
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,560
 But if God so clothes the grass of the field,

525
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,360
 which is today alive and tomorrow thrown in the oven,

526
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,880
 will he not much more clothe you?

527
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 Oh, you of little faith.

528
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,560
 Therefore, this is the punchline, do not be anxious,

529
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,480
 saying what should we eat or what should we drink

530
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,320
 or what should we wear?

531
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,100
 For the Gentiles, people who do not know God,

532
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,640
 your translation may say pagan,

533
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,580
 seek after all of these things,

534
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,580
 and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

535
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,320
 Jesus said, remember, God has promised to provide.

536
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,080
 The second idea we see from the text,

537
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,120
 tracked on your anxiety, remember God's promises.

538
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,440
 This is huge as it relates to that equation.

539
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,500
 What if, and answer that question.

540
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,160
 Then I would, but God will.

541
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,260
 What if I use my own life?

542
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,300
 I could find myself meditating on

543
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,520
 what if my wife gets cancer and she dies,

544
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,600
 and I'm left to raise three kids all by myself?

545
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,360
 What if?

546
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,180
 Then I would be so heartbroken.

547
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,240
 What if my wife died?

548
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,320
 Then I would walk through probably the most painful season

549
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,480
 I'll ever walk through.

550
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,680
 Then I would have to figure out raising children

551
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,900
 and childcare and all of that alone.

552
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,900
 But God has promised he will never leave me nor forsake me.

553
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,740
 He will get me through it,

554
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,180
 and he is near to the brokenhearted.

555
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,340
 What if you lose your job?

556
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,980
 Then you may have to make some changes in how you spend.

557
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,720
 It may be just even for a season

558
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,060
 while you look and find another job.

559
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,440
 But God has promised he will provide for you.

560
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,800
 He is enough, and he is a sustainer.

561
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,520
 Not to provide for all of your wants,

562
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,600
 but promised I will provide for all of your needs.

563
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 Jesus brilliantly brings them back.

564
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,160
 He says, "Man, you're acting like people

565
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,000
 "who don't have a heavenly father.

566
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,580
 "You have a heavenly father who provides for birds

567
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,880
 "and lilies and does all of this,

568
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,640
 "and you don't think he'll provide for you?"

569
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,660
 He brilliantly points out, remember what God has promised.

570
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,660
 So what if?

571
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,620
 What if you're single for the rest of your life?

572
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,320
 Stare it down, man.

573
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,440
 You will find freedom,

574
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
 but only through staring it down and saying,

575
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,480
 "Then I would be sad,

576
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,300
 "and I would feel lonely,

577
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,900
 "but God has promised I am never alone.

578
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,700
 "He will never leave me nor forsake me.

579
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,640
 "He is nearer to me than the breath I breathe,

580
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,060
 "and he will sustain me.

581
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,180
 "What if?

582
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,800
 "Then I would, but God will."

583
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,560
 Here's some of the promises that God has given us.

584
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,660
 As it relates to promises that no matter what we walk

585
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,940
 through, if that old girlfriend or boyfriend,

586
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,940
 what if they start dating someone else?

587
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,580
 Then I would be really sad,

588
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,200
 and I would be really tempted to go stalk them on Instagram.

589
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,220
 But God has another story that he's writing,

590
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,280
 and if they're not a part of that future

591
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,680
 in a spouse way with me,

592
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,140
 or they're not gonna be a part of my life,

593
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,540
 God has promised he will work all things together for good.

594
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,220
 And as you begin to rehearse this,

595
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,680
 you will begin to experience peace,

596
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,660
 because there's no magic words that you can say

597
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,580
 that can prevent a boyfriend from dating somebody else,

598
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,520
 a mom from getting cancer,

599
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,140
 but we can cling to God will.

600
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,100
 God has promised, and when we do,

601
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,820
 peace begins to be experienced,

602
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,900
 'cause peace is beginning to be embraced.

603
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,940
 Some of the promises that God has given us,

604
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,260
 that no matter what we walk through,

605
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,940
 what if, then I would, but God will be my provider.

606
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,060
 Hebrews chapter 13,

607
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,100
 but God will still be the cornerstone of my life.

608
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,620
 First Peter chapter two, verse six.

609
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,940
 I think these are up on the screen.

610
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
 That God will still protect me.

611
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,260
 Psalm 32, verse seven.

612
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,420
 That no matter what I walk through,

613
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,540
 God will restore my joy.

614
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,300
 As dark as the season I'm in right now,

615
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,140
 he has promised, he is a joy restorer.

616
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,380
 No matter what I walk through,

617
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,100
 God has promised, he offers peace beyond understanding.

618
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,260
 That God has promised that the trial I'm facing,

619
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,240
 he will use to make me wiser and stronger in my faith

620
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,620
 as a result of the trial.

621
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,640
 James chapter one.

622
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,740
 That God has promised he will help me in my time of need.

623
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,660
 Hebrews chapter four.

624
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,100
 That God has promised to draw near to me,

625
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,380
 and he draws near to those who are brokenhearted.

626
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,660
 What if it happens?

627
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,140
 Then I would, but God will.

628
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,360
 God has promised to work all things together for good.

629
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,100
 Jesus tells them what he would tell you.

630
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,820
 Remember who your heavenly father is.

631
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,540
 He has promised to provide for your needs.

632
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,380
 He can be trusted.

633
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,700
 John Owen was an old Puritan who had a saying

634
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,060
 that he said it is irrational for a Christian

635
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:45,980
 to be anxious because a Christian has said,

636
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,620
 "God, I trust you with all of eternity."

637
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,820
 And being anxious is saying,

638
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,400
 "God, I trust you with all of eternity,

639
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,080
 "just not with Thursday."

640
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,940
 Now, that doesn't mean that it's not understandable

641
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,340
 or it's not an experience.

642
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,180
 It just is not a rational, logical thing

643
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,420
 'cause we as believers know God has promised

644
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,220
 he will provide for your needs.

645
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,300
 He clearly and most clearly did so on the cross,

646
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,800
 dying for you, giving his life to provide

647
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,640
 the ultimate payment for you to spend eternity with God,

648
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,100
 that he has gone to such great lengths

649
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,260
 to show I will provide for your needs,

650
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,400
 and I've already done so for your greatest need

651
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,960
 by dying in your place.

652
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,860
 As it's been well said,

653
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,080
 Christians do not know what tomorrow holds.

654
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,040
 We're the only ones who know who holds tomorrow.

655
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,120
 Christians, we don't always know

656
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,760
 what tomorrow's gonna hold,

657
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,120
 but you are the only people on the planet

658
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,280
 who know the God who holds tomorrow in his hands.

659
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,780
 I was reading this week and this verse came alive

660
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,080
 like honestly I've never thought about before.

661
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,260
 There's a verse in Isaiah, it's an Old Testament prophet,

662
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,860
 chapter 26, verse three,

663
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,920
 and it's a verse that I've always read

664
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,440
 and felt like that is, oh man, that is so far from me,

665
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,780
 and he says, "You keep in perfect peace.

666
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,140
 "You keep him or her in perfect peace

667
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,100
 "whose mind is stayed, focused, fixed on you

668
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,740
 "because he trusts you."

669
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,500
 That's essentially what Jesus is saying.

670
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,600
 Hey, remember who your God is.

671
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
 Keep your mind.

672
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,720
 You have a heavenly father who's promised to provide.

673
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,980
 God will come through.

674
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,200
 He will sustain.

675
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
 Keep your mind focused there,

676
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,400
 and you'll experience peace focusing on him,

677
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
 who he is, what he's promised,

678
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,100
 and you'll experience peace.

679
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,240
 What if?

680
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,740
 Then I would, but my God will.

681
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,860
 Jesus asks another question, the third idea,

682
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,680
 so you have to track down your anxiety,

683
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,020
 remember God's promises, and then he says this.

684
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,440
 "Can any of you, by worrying,

685
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,420
 "add a single hour to your life?"

686
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,640
 Now, I think he's messing with them in this question,

687
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,820
 but that's me, maybe that's just how I read the Bible,

688
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,220
 where he's asking, hey, let me just take a side note,

689
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,140
 pause here.

690
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,080
 While we're on the subject, let's just all agree.

691
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,500
 Does worrying add anything beneficial to your life?

692
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,980
 To which we would all agree, no.

693
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,060
 I mean, you may have never thought about it before,

694
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,080
 but you worrying about whether or not

695
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
 you're gonna be single for forever

696
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,360
 does nothing to remove whether or not

697
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,760
 you're actually gonna be single for forever.

698
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,080
 If anything, it may lower or increase the chances,

699
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,840
 'cause you're a little bitter to be around.

700
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,220
 And if you worry about whether or not

701
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,800
 you're gonna have enough money in a bank account to,

702
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,140
 I'm kidding, it was a joke, don't send me the email.

703
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,340
 If you worry about whether or not

704
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,680
 you're gonna have enough money in the bank account

705
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,140
 to pay rent, does that do anything beneficial

706
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,660
 to actually increase the amount in your bank account

707
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,500
 to pay rent?

708
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,340
 No.

709
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,460
 And Jesus is pretty brilliant.

710
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,540
 They go, let's just all get on the same page here

711
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,140
 and understand, I think we can all agree,

712
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,840
 worrying is useless.

713
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
 Understand, worry is useless.

714
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,860
 It's the third idea that we see from the text,

715
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,520
 that he's saying it doesn't add.

716
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,900
 Let's at least all agree it does nothing beneficial

717
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,620
 inside of our life.

718
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,900
 In fact, studies have shown by the Mayo Clinic,

719
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,220
 Charles Mayo said, "Worry affects the circulation,

720
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,800
 "the heart, the glands, the whole nervous system.

721
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,380
 "Though I have never known a man who died of overwork,

722
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,900
 "I have known a lot who died of worry."

723
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,020
 If anything, science would say it takes off of your life.

724
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,780
 And Jesus would say, man, let's at least agree

725
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,520
 it is not a useful thing.

726
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,820
 I think one of the even flaws in the ways

727
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,580
 that we think about anxiety and worry

728
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,440
 and the way we express it is flawed.

729
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,280
 What do I mean?

730
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,180
 You'll even use terms that are like,

731
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,260
 man, I just, you know, I struggle with control

732
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,180
 or I have anxiety and I just, you know,

733
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,380
 I struggle with control.

734
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,760
 I think that is a statement or sentence

735
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,340
 that we should take out of our repertoire, if you will.

736
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,220
 Why do I say that?

737
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,140
 Because you don't struggle with control.

738
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,700
 You've never had control.

739
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,220
 That's like saying I struggle with x-ray vision.

740
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,140
 It's like, no, you have never had x-ray vision

741
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,180
 and you never will have x-ray vision.

742
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,680
 You have never had control and you never will have control.

743
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,100
 Because control is something that only God has.

744
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,340
 And Jesus is brilliantly just saying,

745
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,180
 let's just all agree, get on the same page,

746
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,100
 understand worry is useless.

747
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
 And then he gives a really practical tip

748
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,380
 'cause that one didn't feel as practical.

749
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,220
 At least we can all agree, but what do I do?

750
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,100
 Let's say, remember what God has promised.

751
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,620
 She tracked down your anxiety.

752
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,780
 And then brilliantly, he goes into another practical tip.

753
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,620
 But seek first the kingdom of God

754
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,860
 and his righteousness

755
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,100
 and all these things will be added to you.

756
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,740
 This I think is one of the most misunderstood verses

757
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,080
 as it relates to anxiety.

758
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,940
 What Jesus is saying is the fourth idea from the text,

759
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,100
 which is seek God's kingdom and surrender yours.

760
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,300
 Place as highest priority God's kingdom.

761
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,920
 When it comes to who sits on the throne of your life

762
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,460
 and whose agenda comes first,

763
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,060
 let there be no competition, it is God's.

764
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,500
 And embrace God's kingdom or prioritize the same word

765
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,400
 first in your life.

766
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,900
 God's agenda, God's will, God's reign for you.

767
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,480
 Now, most people read this verse and they think,

768
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,620
 Jesus is saying, hey, don't worry, go on a mission trip.

769
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,420
 Don't worry, read your Bible.

770
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,220
 Don't worry, tithe.

771
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,260
 None of us are bad things.

772
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,100
 They just way oversimplify and miss the power of this verse.

773
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,740
 What Jesus is saying, I want you to place

774
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,740
 as first in your life, God's agenda, God's kingdom.

775
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,860
 It's another way, it's the same word for reign

776
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,340
 or agenda or kingdom above your own, above anyone else's.

777
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,380
 Now, why is that brilliant?

778
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,860
 Because you know what all of my worries

779
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,540
 and all of your worries have in common?

780
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,140
 At the center, they're all about your kingdom.

781
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,060
 Now, you would never put it that way 'cause that's weird

782
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,100
 and we don't have kingdoms,

783
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,300
 but they're all about your wants and your desires,

784
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,340
 which is your agenda.

785
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,900
 Your kingdom.

786
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,500
 In other words, I'd never find myself laying awake

787
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,940
 at night worried, I mean, emotionally anxious

788
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,100
 and overwhelmed by like God's agenda

789
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,300
 and God's desires for the world.

790
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,820
 I've never been unable to fall asleep over,

791
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,300
 God, there's just so many people in China

792
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,260
 and I don't know if you have what it takes

793
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,300
 to save all of them or what are we gonna do?

794
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,100
 No, but that's God's agenda and God's kingdom.

795
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,560
 I worry about my kingdom, my agenda, my wants,

796
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,560
 my car, my kids, my life, my house, just like you do.

797
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,900
 At the epicenter of all of those things,

798
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,380
 it's God's kingdom and he's saying,

799
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,940
 if you will begin to prioritize and place

800
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,820
 as first importance in your life and in your heart,

801
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,780
 God's agenda, even when it contradicts yours,

802
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,060
 you will begin to experience peace.

803
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:53,940
 The idea of kingdom is kind of built on the idea

804
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,860
 of me not getting what I want.

805
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,340
 That's ultimately why I worry.

806
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,380
 Me not getting or things not going how I want them to go,

807
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,940
 which is so funny because as every person

808
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,460
 in this room has realized,

809
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,940
 life is not always going to go the way you want it to go.

810
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,660
 And we don't always get the things that we want.

811
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,300
 In other words, it's not possible.

812
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,020
 There's gonna come times where God's will

813
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,540
 or whatever happens in my life is not the things that I want.

814
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,620
 That's not, it's not possible to get everything

815
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,860
 that I want all the time.

816
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,140
 And so having everything according to my agenda

817
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,500
 or my kingdom is not possible, but peace is.

818
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,980
 In other words, you can live life

819
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,180
 and have not everything go always the way

820
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,580
 that you want it to and have anxiety,

821
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,060
 or you can not have everything you want and have peace.

822
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,620
 Having everything you want is not possible.

823
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,340
 Peace is, and Jesus is saying,

824
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,500
 put on the throne God's agenda,

825
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,420
 God's revealed will, excuse me, for your life.

826
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,620
 Now, what does that mean?

827
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,740
 There's two ways we know the will of God in scripture.

828
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,580
 There's the Bible, which is his revealed will,

829
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,740
 basically the commands, instructions that he gives.

830
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,100
 And then there's the unrevealed will of God.

831
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,380
 What is that?

832
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,260
 That is God is sovereignly over everything.

833
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,020
 And so everything that happens in my life

834
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,860
 is something that has come through his hands.

835
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,180
 He is over, and whenever life begins to go,

836
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,660
 not how I want it to go, in other words,

837
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,620
 whenever God's will unfolds in front of me in my life

838
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,260
 in a way that I didn't want it to be,

839
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,260
 I can either choose to say, God, your kingdom,

840
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,980
 your will comes before mine, I trust you.

841
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,980
 Or I can be anxious, but it won't thwart the will of God.

842
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,620
 But I can choose, God, when those times happen,

843
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,020
 I choose to trust you, your kingdom comes before my kingdom,

844
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,260
 your will comes before my will.

845
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,100
 He brings us back, so to something he said 20 verses earlier,

846
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,660
 like I mean in the same chapter,

847
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,080
 I mean like this is like 35 seconds later in the sermon,

848
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,080
 where in chapter six, verse nine,

849
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,900
 remember we were on verse 33,

850
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,620
 he brings up the same words, kingdom and will.

851
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,100
 And he says, this is how you should pray.

852
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,260
 Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name,

853
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,820
 which is as holy or amazing as your name.

854
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,580
 Your kingdom come, your will be done

855
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:35,260
 on earth as it is in heaven.

856
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,740
 God, your kingdom comes before my kingdom.

857
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,780
 And he said, this is how you should pray,

858
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,620
 you should go to God, say God,

859
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,560
 your will comes before my will.

860
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,900
 I want your agenda before my agenda.

861
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,220
 And then 18 verses later, says,

862
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,380
 prioritize God's kingdom, God's agenda,

863
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,700
 even when it contradicts yours.

864
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,100
 And when you do, you'll experience peace,

865
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,100
 or you can not embrace God's agenda and experience panic,

866
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,740
 but it's not gonna change the circumstances around you.

867
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,580
 What does this look like?

868
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,780
 It looks like financially, whenever you don't get the job,

869
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,980
 you go, God, you pour your heart out.

870
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,980
 So God, you know, desperately I need a job.

871
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,340
 But if that wasn't the career,

872
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,460
 that wasn't the one that you wanted me to have,

873
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,820
 I don't know what I'm gonna do.

874
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,460
 Would you please provide a career, a job, a position?

875
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,560
 And if this isn't your will, I trust you.

876
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,540
 God, you know how desperately

877
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,340
 I wanted this relationship to work.

878
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:36,160
 And I don't know if I'm ever gonna date again

879
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,080
 after this person, I don't know if it is gonna work.

880
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,740
 Maybe we're about to break up.

881
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,060
 And God, I really wanted this to work.

882
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,780
 If that's not your will, I trust you.

883
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,500
 And I'm gonna embrace his kingdom.

884
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,940
 I'm gonna seek his kingdom first, surrender mine.

885
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,300
 And when it contradicts, I'm gonna embrace his

886
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,580
 and I will experience peace.

887
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,820
 He models this himself, Jesus talking about

888
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,000
 when in the garden of Gethsemane,

889
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,140
 he does this exact thing when he prays.

890
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,860
 And he goes to God hours before he's gonna be crucified.

891
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,020
 And look at what he prays, Mark chapter 14.

892
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,420
 Abba, Father, everything is possible for you.

893
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,700
 Take this cup from me.

894
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,320
 In other words, translation, God, I don't wanna die

895
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,820
 on a cross and be separated from you.

896
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,080
 Is there another way?

897
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,260
 Yet not what I will, but what you will.

898
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,360
 Your kingdom comes before mine, your will comes before mine.

899
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,380
 And I can either choose to embrace that

900
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,180
 when life doesn't go the way that I want

901
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,700
 and say, God, this is not what I would have.

902
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,140
 The cancer treatment isn't working.

903
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,060
 And if something doesn't change, I'm worried.

904
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,620
 We may not have much time left.

905
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,260
 So will you please allow it to work?

906
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,620
 But if that's not your will, I trust you.

907
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,940
 I'm trying to trust you.

908
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,220
 Your kingdom comes before mine.

909
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,020
 You help me.

910
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,860
 And when you do, you will begin to experience peace.

911
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,740
 Finally, he gives us the final solution.

912
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,420
 It's really important as it relates to anxiety.

913
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,060
 It says this, "Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow,

914
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,440
 "for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

915
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,220
 "Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."

916
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,660
 I love it.

917
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,020
 Jesus just said, don't worry about tomorrow.

918
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,780
 Tomorrow's gonna have enough trouble of its own.

919
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,340
 You got enough problems today.

920
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,180
 Focus on that.

921
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,620
 The final idea from this text is take one day at a time.

922
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,700
 Anxiety is one of those things that sometimes preachers

923
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,740
 or sometimes just people in general can communicate,

924
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,860
 hey, if you will do enough of these steps,

925
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,140
 anxiety, you'll never have it again

926
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,280
 for the rest of your life.

927
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,700
 You'll experience peace.

928
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,660
 You'll never worry, which is just not true.

929
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,660
 Jesus says, hey, you take every day,

930
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,180
 you focus just on today.

931
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,980
 And the daily battle of anxiety is one

932
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,140
 that will be present for the rest of your life.

933
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,180
 And it's gonna be, anxiety's gonna be present in our world

934
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,860
 and fear and worry for the rest of your life.

935
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:16,940
 But it's control over your peace and over you

936
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,340
 doesn't have to be present for the rest of your life.

937
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,060
 But it is daily choosing to apply God's word

938
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,300
 that I'm gonna choose to trust you

939
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,380
 in a moment by moment basis,

940
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,140
 in a world where the current is gonna try to push you

941
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,020
 in the direction of anxiety and of worry and of peace.

942
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,340
 And if you're not intentional,

943
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,580
 you're gonna be moved in that direction.

944
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,340
 It's like this, my wife and I, we love going to the beach.

945
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,460
 And so we'll go to the beach and from time to time,

946
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:46,020
 we'll go with family or go with extended family.

947
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,860
 And a couple of years ago,

948
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,180
 we were at the beach with extended family.

949
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,280
 And while we were there, I was out throwing Frisbee

950
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,220
 in the water with one of my brothers.

951
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,200
 And we're out there in front of our resort

952
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,040
 and throwing it around maybe 45 minutes.

953
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,620
 And I look up and we are three resorts down

954
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
 from where we were staying.

955
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,080
 What had happened?

956
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,260
 Well, we didn't ever walk down that way.

957
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
 It just did what happens

958
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,060
 if you've been in the ocean before.

959
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,380
 The current just pushes you.

960
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,100
 The tide and the water just moved you

961
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,220
 without ever intending to or ever trying to

962
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,140
 or ever wanting to.

963
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,060
 It just moved you in that direction.

964
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:20,900
 And so what do you do?

965
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,420
 Well, you're in the ocean, you just get up, you walk

966
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,420
 and you move against the tide and against the current

967
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,220
 to get back to where you want to be.

968
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,320
 This world is broken.

969
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,340
 Jesus even promised in John chapter 16

970
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,220
 before he left the planet,

971
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,120
 one of his final prayers that he gave.

972
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:44,420
 He said, "In this world, you will have trouble.

973
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,320
 "You can bet on it.

974
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,220
 "Children die before they ever should.

975
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,960
 "People get sick and they leave spouses behind.

976
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,780
 "Relationships don't work.

977
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
 "Jobs, pandemics happen."

978
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,180
 In John chapter 16, verse 33,

979
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,220
 "But take heart, I have overcome the world."

980
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,980
 In the same verse, he says,

981
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,020
 "I have told you these things so that in me

982
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,900
 "you may have peace."

983
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,060
 You live in a world that is gonna try to push you

984
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,140
 like an ocean current where just fear unintentionally

985
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,260
 and anxiety and worry for the rest of your life

986
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,100
 are gonna push you.

987
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,780
 But it is possible to move against the current,

988
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,420
 but it is not a one-time-done fixed thing.

989
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,460
 It is a day-by-day, God, I surrender, I trust you.

990
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,620
 I know you're in control.

991
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,540
 I know that you're for me.

992
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,020
 I remember your promises.

993
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,200
 No matter what valley of the shadow I walk through,

994
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,260
 you are with me.

995
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,300
 You will comfort me, you will sustain me,

996
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,460
 and I can trust you.

997
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,300
 And when things get dark, I have the promise

998
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,180
 that I will spend all of eternity with you,

999
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,700
 and I'm gonna keep fighting against that current.

1000
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,940
 And it is a day-by-day thing.

1001
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,060
 And I wish there was an answer,

1002
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,140
 and I wish there was a book that just said,

1003
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,460
 "Hey, just do this one thing,

1004
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,940
 "you'll never be anxious again."

1005
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,100
 That doesn't exist.

1006
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
 That is a fantasy.

1007
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,540
 But it is possible to decide,

1008
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,220
 God, I'm gonna trust you.

1009
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,580
 When life is not going how I want it to,

1010
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,640
 I'm gonna trust you.

1011
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,020
 I'm gonna remember your word, your promises.

1012
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,180
 This is why we harbor in community so much around here,

1013
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,460
 because sometimes in those moments

1014
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,740
 where I'm overwhelmed with anxiety,

1015
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,860
 I need people in my life that remind me,

1016
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,140
 this is what's true.

1017
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,820
 This is who God says you are.

1018
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,520
 This is who God is.

1019
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,120
 To help me push against that current,

1020
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,920
 to walk and move in the direction of peace.

1021
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,880
 And when I do, I move against the current of anxiety,

1022
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,360
 and experience a peace, not of this world,

1023
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,120
 but of God.

1024
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,720
 If you're in the room and you've never had a moment

1025
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,020
 where you trusted in Jesus,

1026
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,240
 you experiencing freedom from anxiety

1027
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,280
 is really not possible,

1028
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,640
 because you should have a level of anxiety,

1029
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,960
 because you are gonna stand before God,

1030
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,660
 who is perfect, holy.

1031
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,360
 And it was said abundantly clear in the scriptures,

1032
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,080
 there is no one who is worthy

1033
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,600
 to spend all of eternity with me,

1034
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,180
 based on how they behave,

1035
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,300
 but what they believe.

1036
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,000
 In other words, it is not whosoever behaves

1037
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,120
 shall not perish, have eternal life.

1038
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,440
 It is whosoever believes in what Jesus did on the cross

1039
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,800
 shall not perish, but have eternal life.

1040
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,640
 And you should be anxious if you've never trusted in him,

1041
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,960
 because you are headed to spend eternity

1042
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,000
 apart from the God who loved you so much,

1043
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,200
 he gave his life for you,

1044
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,160
 who doesn't expect you to do something for him.

1045
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,800
 He gave his life and did something for you,

1046
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,040
 but you have to receive it and accept it.

1047
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,760
 And you will never experience peace,

1048
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,780
 'cause you don't have a relationship

1049
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,280
 with the Prince of Peace, the Bible calls him.

1050
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,080
 But for the rest of us,

1051
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,840
 we can choose to trust in the midst of anxiety,

1052
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,700
 to take all of that and track down our anxiety,

1053
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,760
 to remember the promises of God,

1054
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,000
 to understand worry is useless,

1055
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,480
 to seek God's kingdom and surrender ours,

1056
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,640
 and to take it one day at a time,

1057
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,600
 which spells out trust.

1058
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,020
 If you are in a place where you could use prayer,

1059
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,160
 I'd love to pray for you.

1060
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,480
 You're walking through and you're anxious,

1061
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,760
 and man, it's all over the room.

1062
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,400
 And so if you bring the lights down,

1063
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,720
 and everyone who's here,

1064
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,040
 we're just gonna bow heads really quick.

1065
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
 And if you will raise your hand,

1066
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,380
 I'd love to just pray for you specifically,

1067
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,840
 where it is real,

1068
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,120
 the things that I'm saying, you feel,

1069
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,980
 it hits different,

1070
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,480
 because of where you are right now,

1071
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,200
 and you're not alone, God loves you,

1072
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,920
 he is for you, and if that's where you're at,

1073
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,760
 will you just raise a hand?

1074
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,680
 I just wanna pray specifically over you.

1075
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,440
 Father, I pray for these friends,

1076
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,040
 who my heart breaks at knowing the pain and the fear,

1077
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,120
 the uncertainty, confusion,

1078
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:04,880
 and I can only imagine how much more your heart,

1079
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,560
 because you know each one of these hands,

1080
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,920
 you know each one of the men and women right now,

1081
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,220
 walking through what they're walking through,

1082
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,800
 you know every hair on their head,

1083
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,960
 you love them far more than any person ever will.

1084
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,520
 And so I pray that you would be more near to them,

1085
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,280
 and their awareness of your nearness

1086
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,240
 would be greater than ever before.

1087
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,760
 You would be more real in their life,

1088
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,720
 than fear, than anxiety,

1089
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,120
 than worry, than depression,

1090
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,760
 and that you would help them experience peace,

1091
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,720
 on a moment by moment, day by day basis.

1092
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,320
 Thank you that you went to the cross,

1093
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,400
 and you gave your life,

1094
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,600
 so that we could experience peace for all of eternity,

1095
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,440
 and walk and experience increasing amounts of it,

1096
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,880
 in this life,

1097
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,800
 would this series be another addition to push,

1098
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,680
 and promote that in our hearts.

1099
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,680
 We love you,

1100
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,440
 and pray all of this in the name of Jesus, amen.

1101
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:11,440
