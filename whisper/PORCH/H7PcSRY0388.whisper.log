[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:36.640]   >> Porch, so great to be with you, man.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.360]   Feels good to be at home.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.320]   I've been running a bunch of different directions and
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.240]   just a breath of fresh air to worship with you.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.000]   I was actually worshiping in that last song.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I was like, man, worship is so good.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240]   Man, I wonder what the speaker's gonna say.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.240]   And then I was like, wait, hold on.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.520]   Wonder what the message is gonna be.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.320]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.960]   But man, so fantastic to be with you.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.320]   If you're tuning in anywhere around the world, Fort Worth, greetings.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.680]   Dallas, greetings.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.480]   Houston, there's a gathering in Houston tonight.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.680]   Glad you guys are gathering around the word with us as well.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.000]   And if you're driving in your car or live streaming somewhere else,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.920]   you need to know the Porch is a movement of young adults seeking to change the world
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.960]   for the cause of Christ.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.840]   And if you don't know him and you're here tonight, welcome home.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.080]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.520]   Welcome into our home.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.040]   We'd love for you to make it your home.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.720]   And we'd love to talk to you more about the one whose name we gather in.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.440]   And so we're continuing this series, Summer on the Mount, as we wind down
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   the greatest sermon ever told, Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.280]   And as I thought about where we were headed tonight, something happened this week.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880]   I had a guys retreat, community guys retreat in Dallas.
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.120]   We stayed in Dallas, went and ate barbecue, ate way too much barbecue
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.640]   down in the Bishop Arts District.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.760]   And so that's just kind of the cool, really cool area of Dallas.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.840]   Anybody here live in Bishop Arts?
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.200]   Yeah, you're so much cooler than me.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.480]   I know that already about you.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.280]   That's true.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.520]   And so we went down there with my guys and we kind of ended the night by going to this
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.120]   place, Dude Sweet Chocolate.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.440]   And so they have this just like this place where they make chocolate.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.920]   And we're walking through there, me and my buddies, and we're tasting stuff.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.480]   And I taste this truffle that they have there.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.760]   I'm just like, that's amazing.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.840]   Okay, so that's what heaven will taste like.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.080]   And so I'm like, I'll take some of that.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080]   And then we come up on this thing and I'm like, what's this?
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.240]   And she's like, oh, that's this chocolate bar that we make with this Japanese pepper.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480]   We have it imported from Japan.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.400]   And like, have you heard of ghost pepper?
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.920]   She's like, oh, it's hotter than that.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   You know, and it's infused into this.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.360]   And so we're just a bunch of guys.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.720]   Of course, we're going to get that, you know, I mean, we're not going to eat it, but we'll
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.160]   get it, you know, and so, and then we'll like dare each other or something.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.840]   So I'm like, oh, I'll take one of those.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.440]   And so then I go home and I put the bag on the counter and I wake up the next day and
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   I've got two little girls, right?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.120]   Presley, who's eight and Finley.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.040]   And they see the bag and they're like, daddy, what's in the bag?
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I just, I don't even think I'm like, oh, it's, it's some chocolate I bought.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080]   And they're like, oh, daddy, can we have some, can we have some?
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.520]   And I'm like, sure, sure.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   And so I go, you know, and so I just pull it out.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.080]   Right.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.720]   And, and I go, you know, for the truffle and I just, I open it up and I'm like, you know,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.280]   good dad.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.560]   Oh, I'll open the other side.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.680]   And I'm like, good dad.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.280]   And, um, and so let me, yeah, let me, let me get you, you know, it's just,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.760]   it's just a little piece of chocolate.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.440]   And so I grab it for him and I get a little knife and I cut it up.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.080]   Right.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.840]   And I'm like, you know, you guys can each, each have a piece.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.880]   It's, it's wonderful.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   It's wonderful.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.040]   And Finley, my, my middle little girl, she goes, I want that.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.160]   And I go, no, you don't want that.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.640]   I was here.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.120]   Have this.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.840]   It's wonderful.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.720]   You're going to love it.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.280]   She's no daddy.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.120]   I don't even like dark, dark chocolate.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.000]   Ugh.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.480]   I don't know.
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.040]   I don't want that.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.000]   I want that.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.080]   And I go, no, family bear, listen, I promise you, you don't want that.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.680]   Have a bite of this one.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   And Presley, see Presley, she's eight.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.880]   She's been with me eight whole years and she has learned this experiment.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.240]   She knows she's, this is just going to be a sermon illustration of some sort, you know,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.120]   she knows.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.040]   And so she says, she goes, she goes, daddy, which one do you think I should eat?
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.600]   And I'm like, baby girl, I'm telling you, you have to have a pie.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.200]   It's, it's going to be wonderful.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.080]   And she doesn't have, you know, she asked me, she pops in her mouth.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.840]   She's like, oh daddy, that is good.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.300]   Wow.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.960]   And Finley's still there.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.560]   She's like, daddy, I want that one.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.200]   I want that.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.480]   I want the, I want the bar.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.240]   I'm a baby girl.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.740]   Listen.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.440]   Okay.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.920]   Here we go.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.600]   The choice is yours.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.100]   Okay.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.480]   But I'm telling you, you don't want that bar.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.760]   You want to eat the piece.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.880]   I'm trying to give you.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.560]   And she takes it and she opens up, rips into it and she takes a bite.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   And at first, you know, it's milk chocolate, sweet.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.800]   She's, she just kind of looks at me like, it looks at Presley, like we little bitty piece
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.720]   got my chocolate bar, you know?
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.920]   And then she goes, and she runs, I'm not kidding.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.720]   I'm not making this up.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.120]   She runs to the sink, turns on the sink and she's like trying to drink from the faucet.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.800]   She's like, it's just running.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.600]   She's washing.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   She's like, it's just so hot.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   Listen, man, I'm a good dad.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.880]   I desire to give you good things.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   You can try.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.800]   And so what's going on there, right?
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.360]   All of her perception, she sees something she doesn't want.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.280]   She sees something she does want.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.360]   She sees something bigger.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.880]   All of, all of her senses, all of her being, all of her perception is saying, no, I want
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.360]   that.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.080]   And I'm just sitting there.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.960]   I'm like, no, I know that, that it looks like you do, but you don't.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.920]   It looks like you do, but you don't.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   And then the same way, right?
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.760]   We go through life and we see in the scripture that God is called a loving father and that
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.640]   we're to go to him and we're to ask him, even when it doesn't make sense to us, God, what
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.760]   would you have us do?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.880]   God, this doesn't seem good.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.200]   Is that what you would have me do?
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.480]   God, this seems good.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.600]   Is this the right one?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.720]   You're saying it's not, but it seems like it is.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.600]   And some of us, in fact, I've met with many of you who have turned your back on God and
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.560]   gone away from him because you feel like he's given you something not good when he's given
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.320]   others something that is good.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   And you feel like you've been sliding.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:36.240]   And you question the goodness of God.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.680]   And so tonight I just want to talk about praying to a good father.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.200]   Praying to a good father, say, I think the most unloving thing that you can do to God
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.240]   is question his goodness.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.120]   Said otherwise, I think the most unloving thing that you can do to God is question his
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.840]   love for you.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.360]   He's gone to great lengths to show his love for you.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.400]   Likewise, I've got three kids and I will tell you as a father, I would rather hear them
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.600]   say, I hate you, dad, than hear them say, I don't think you love me, dad.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.040]   If I had to choose between those two awful expressions, I would choose the one that
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.920]   expresses disdain for me rather than the one that questions my love for them.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   And so the reality is God is a good father.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.720]   He seeks to give you good things.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.280]   And if you have something, be it singleness, a breakup, a disease.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   Something unwanted like a pregnancy.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.960]   Something you brought up on your about yourself or something that happened to you.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.600]   I would say, trust him.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.040]   And steward that suffering, knowing that he's a good father and desires to give good
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.200]   things to his children.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.080]   And so when others have left God because they say they don't like what they have in
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.120]   their life, I appreciate their view of his sovereignty.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.240]   But I question their view of his goodness.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.120]   And so as we move through this section, we're going to be in Matthew chapter seven.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.440]   If you want to turn there, starting in verse seven, like I said, it's Jesus's sermon on
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.680]   the Mount, where if you read it, the whole entire sermon would take you about 15 minutes.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.040]   But in those 15 minutes, Jesus covers law, grace, missions, adultery, lust, love, hate,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.280]   judgment, marriage, divorce, enemies, the poor prayer, anxiety, money, materialism,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.480]   heaven and hell in 15 minutes if you read it.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   And so tonight in this little section, verses seven through 12 in chapter seven, we're going
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.920]   to look at how we pray, who we pray to and how God might use you to answer prayers.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.320]   Let's go.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.720]   Jesus says in the sermon, ask he's preaching on this hillside.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.760]   His disciples are there.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.600]   There's people gathering and listening to him as he teaches.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.200]   Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.720]   Seek and you will find.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.800]   Knock and the door will be open to you for everyone who asks, receive.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:08.320]   And the one who seeks finds into the one who knocks the door will be opened.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.240]   And so my first point this evening from this text is pray with persistence.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.760]   Pray continually.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.280]   Pray consistently.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.640]   Pray ongoing.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:25.040]   He's saying, ask, don't just ask, but seek and don't just seek, knock and knock persistently.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.080]   And you say, well, wait a minute.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.240]   JP, does it say not persistently?
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.720]   This is repeated in Luke chapter 11, the same.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.920]   Passage in right before it, he says this, he, he commentates on this passage.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.680]   He says with a parable, he says, suppose you have a friend verse five in Luke chapter 11.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   Suppose you have a friend and you go to him at midnight and say, friend, lend me three
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.560]   loaves of bread.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.720]   A friend of mine on a journey has come to me and I have no food to offer him.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.200]   And suppose the one inside answers, don't bother me.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.080]   The door is already locked to my children and I are in bed.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.680]   I can't get up and give you anything.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.160]   I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.080]   yet because of your shameless audacity, he will surely get up and give you as much as
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   you need because you have the audacity to go to him at midnight and knock repeatedly
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.040]   on his door.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.000]   And you express a desire that's not your own selfish desire, but a desire to care for those
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.800]   around you.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.640]   He will meet that need.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.120]   He will come to the door and he will answer it.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.760]   Jesus is saying something really important about God.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.160]   He hears your prayers and he answers them and he wants you to ask him.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:48.960]   Now, as he's saying, there's some magic number of times you need to ask and ask him and keep
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.600]   asking him until you wear him down until he's so tired of you asking, he's a fine already.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   No, no, that that is not what he's saying.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:07.760]   He's saying that when you ask and you believe that he can meet your needs and you can come
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:15.040]   to him anytime with anything, he hears your prayers and answers them.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.720]   I'll illustrate this with a historical story about Alexander, the great.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:28.080]   Alexander, the great, the great conqueror, the great ruler of a people, very wealthy
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.800]   man had a general who was one of his primary generals and his this general's daughter was
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.360]   getting married.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.800]   He comes to Alexander, the great and says, sir, would you please be so kind to pay for
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.600]   my daughter's wedding?
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.680]   I do not have enough money to pay for her wedding.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.280]   Would you pay for it?
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.040]   I have been faithful to you in battle.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.440]   I have led led your army in many battles.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.520]   Would you please pay for my daughter's wedding?
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:54.240]   And Alexander, the great responds, yes, go and talk to my treasurer and tell him how
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.960]   much you need.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.920]   This general goes to the treasurer and expresses an exorbitant amount to him.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.360]   The more amount than he had ever seen spent on any wedding.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.640]   And the treasurer is appalled and insulted by the notion.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.320]   In fact, he says, hey, you wait right here.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.720]   And he goes to Alexander, the great and says, you will not believe how much money he asked
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:12.960]   for.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.880]   Look at this amount.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.400]   Do you want me to go and punish him?
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.760]   Should I throw him in prison?
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   And Alexander, the great says, no, do you not realize this man has done me a great honor
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:31.200]   for he realizes that I am not only wealthy, but I am also generous given what he asked
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.440]   for.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.640]   And likewise, God is not only wealthy, the cattle on a thousand hills are his.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.920]   Everything is his.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.280]   He's not only wealthy.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.640]   He's not only powerful.
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.160]   He's not only sovereign.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   He's also very generous and he loves you and he's kind to you and he listens to your prayers
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.960]   and he desperately wants a relationship with you.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.760]   Let me say that again.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.960]   And the reason I want to say that again is because anytime a preacher says God is desperate,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.920]   I would question them.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.480]   And I said, God is desperate for something.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.680]   He's desperate for a relationship with you.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.240]   Not a one time conversation and ongoing relationship with you.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.840]   I know he's desperate because he's gone to desperate measures to get it.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.920]   Sacrificing his only son, which I have a son, I can't even imagine.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.560]   To have a relationship with you.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:33.760]   And so I will tell you before we go any further, that there is no such thing as a low maintenance
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.400]   relationship.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.800]   I've sometimes young adults, sometimes you guys tell me like, oh yeah, it's when this
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.240]   relationship is so great, it's low maintenance.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.120]   She's low maintenance.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.720]   No, no, there's no such thing.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.120]   That is a relationship that is ending.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.400]   Okay, there's no, there's no such thing as a low maintenance relationship.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.240]   All relationships require maintenance.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.760]   If you're like, oh yeah, we're such great friends.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.440]   We never see each other and we never talk to each other.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.640]   I would say you're not great friends.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.760]   You're delusional.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:03.840]   Okay, that you're not great friends because relationships, all relationships by definition
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.720]   require maintenance and your relationship with God is no difference.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.680]   What I'm saying is there is no cruise control in Christianity.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.960]   Let me say that again.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.480]   There is no cruise control in Christianity.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:12.960]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.520]   I think we all want to get to this place where we're like, okay, I've got faith.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   I know God, God, you and me are good.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   Let me shift over into cruise control, hang a foot out the window and just, just cruise.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.520]   Right.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.160]   And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.440]   I want to continue to talk to you.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.600]   I want you to continue to build in this relationship.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.880]   I want you to continue to ask, continue to seek, continue to knock.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.920]   There's no cruise control in Christianity.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.000]   And so God answers prayers.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   Yes, he does.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:48.240]   He will always say yes, no, or not now.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:53.600]   And regardless of what he says, you can trust that it is for your good.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.800]   And so seek for the answers, look for the answers.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.640]   Why might God not give me this?
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.680]   Why might a loving father give me this?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.640]   It doesn't seem like a loving father would give me this.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.000]   And so I think we play these weird superstitious games, right?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.240]   Well, if I ask according to his will, that's what first John 5, 14 says.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.880]   If I ask according to his will, I will give it.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.680]   He will give it to me.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.040]   What does that even mean?
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.680]   Like, cause it seems to me at like a face value, it seems like, well, if I asked for
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.240]   what God was already going to do, then I'll have it.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.740]   What?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.520]   And if you didn't ask, you'd also have it cause he was already going to do it.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.160]   So what are you saying?
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.120]   Here's what I think that means.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.920]   Let me break that down.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.320]   If you ask seeking what it is that he wants, but okay, let me say this again.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:51.520]   If you ask looking for what God wants, but it doesn't mean that you don't ask for what
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.160]   you want.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.720]   That's what I see in this text that you ask God for what you want.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.840]   You want to know what I pray for.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.040]   Let me tell you right now what I pray for every day.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.160]   What I pray for anything I want.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.280]   That's what I pray for every single thing that I want.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.200]   Now your prosperity gospel radar might be going off, but let me just, I'm just shooting
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:15.760]   you straight.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.280]   Anything I want, I pray for all while seeking what God wants.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.480]   God, that's what I want.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.680]   What do you want?
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.160]   Father, this is what I want.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.200]   Father, this is what I would like that car.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.400]   I would like that house.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.440]   God, I would like that situation.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.040]   What do you want for me?
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.200]   I want to know what you want.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.240]   Will you align my heart?
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.920]   I want to be a man after your own heart.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.720]   That is a man that desires what you desire.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.840]   Would you do that in me as I come to you and we converse?
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.200]   Because I think we've played this weird game where it's like, okay, well I'm, I really
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.280]   want a, you know, a high rise in uptown.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.840]   I'm going to ask God for a high rise in uptown.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.280]   Yeah, but there's also like starving children in Africa.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.240]   I better pray for that first.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.560]   Okay.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.000]   So, um, and then we feel more spiritual.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.040]   Like God doesn't know you want a high rise in uptown, but you're playing some crazy superstitious
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.520]   game with him.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.760]   And like, he doesn't see your heart and know exactly what you want.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.000]   And I think what he's saying is, why didn't you just be honest with me?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.600]   Thank you for praying for children that you don't know, or even really care about that
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:21.840]   much.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.640]   And why didn't you just ask me for the high rise in uptown?
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.360]   So that I might change your heart to desire what it is that I desire.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.560]   Can we, can we be real?
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.160]   Can we stop playing games with each other?
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.120]   You and me, I want an honest relationship with you.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.360]   Can you ask me for what it is that you desire?
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.080]   That's what I'm asking you to do this as clearly as I possibly can.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:55.680]   And so in college, when I was dating a girl, we'll call her Melissa, because that was her
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.180]   name.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:06.000]   When I was dating Melissa, I think God wanted me to beg her not to break up with me because
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   that was my greatest desire that she wouldn't.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.680]   And so I think he legitimately wanted me to beg him, God, please don't let her break up
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   with me all while showing me that the relationship was not holy.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.440]   It was not godly that if she was an idol in my life and that if she broke up with me,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.960]   it wasn't going to be that big of a deal.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.840]   And frankly, probably one of the greatest things that could ever happen to me is for
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.360]   her to end that relationship.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.960]   So I think that God wanted me to beg him, Lord, please don't let Melissa break my heart
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.160]   all while he would come and say, Hey, can I show you what I desire for you?
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.080]   Why would he want me to ask him that?
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.040]   Because it was honest.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.720]   Because it was how I feel.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.600]   Because it was what I wanted.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.080]   Verse nine, which of you, if your son asked for bread, will give him a stone or if he
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.040]   asked for fish, will give him a snake.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.440]   If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.840]   more will your father, how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.640]   who ask him?
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   Oh, man.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.640]   So my second point is pray to a perfect father.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.800]   Pray to a perfect father.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.600]   This passage is talking about God and it's talking about me.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.600]   And what it says about God is he's a good dad.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.800]   And what it says about me is I'm an evil dad.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.000]   Do you see that?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.720]   It says, if you, though you are evil, it just assumes.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.480]   If you and your role, your role is evil.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.760]   Your role is evil.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.240]   If you know how to give good gifts to your children, then how much better are the gifts
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.360]   that come from a perfect, loving, good father?
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.880]   If you give good gifts to your children, even though you're evil.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.760]   I love to give my kids good things.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.080]   I love to.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.760]   I delight in it.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:04.240]   You know, we spayed, we, we saved thousands and thousands of dollars over a long period
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.480]   of time so that we could take the three of them to the blistering heat of Orlando and
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.360]   gather around a weird place that worships a mouse.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:22.480]   And so that we could sit in lines that were way too long and deal with their whininess
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.600]   and senses of entitlement.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.640]   You know why I did it?
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.360]   You think I wanted to go if I could choose anywhere in the world, that's where I wanted
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:29.680]   to go.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:37.520]   I did it so I could hear them giggle because I delight in that.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:46.080]   I paid for their smiles and to make some memories with them because I love them that much.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.440]   And I'm an evil dad.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.960]   How much better is he than me?
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.240]   And so some of you are like, man, my dad never took me to Disney world.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   In fact, he did terrible things.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.920]   He wasn't even there.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   And I would say, don't throw God out with your father.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.920]   God is not the reflection of your earthly father.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.280]   He's the perfection of him.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.720]   God's not like your earthly dad.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.040]   He's like the, your perfect dad, like a perfect dad.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.920]   And you know what this passage says?
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.760]   He doesn't give snakes and stones.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.400]   He doesn't know how.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.400]   It's not what he does.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.440]   It's not his character.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.480]   He can't not give you good.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   God will answer your prayer every single time with something good.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.200]   Is that crazy?
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.560]   What I just said, God's going to answer your prayer every single time with something good.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.200]   Now you, here's the only catch I got for you.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.480]   It might take time and perspective to learn that it was good.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.880]   You might not fully see that it was good until you are with him in his kingdom.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.240]   Looking back, it's like, Oh, now I see what you were doing.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.160]   Okay.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.320]   But how do I know?
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:13.360]   If it was a good thing that Melissa broke up with me when it felt like the most painful
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.680]   thing in the world, how do I know cancer is not the same?
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.960]   Did you hear me?
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.520]   You hear what I'm saying?
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.880]   How do I know that something terrible right here is not equally as good as that time when
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.240]   Melissa broke my heart?
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.680]   You say, JP, how can cancer be good?
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.080]   Listen, it's a broken world.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.200]   We live in a fallen world, a world that we ushered sin into.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.360]   And now there's all these sorts of terrible things.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.640]   But the scripture says, God is at work in the terrible things, working out good for
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.440]   those who love him.
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:52.480]   And you can roll your eyes and you can shun that and you can think it's not true.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:23:00.160]   But I will tell you that if God gave me cancer right now, and I suffered through chemo right
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.320]   now in the midst of health, and I'm sure I'd question him and I may have momentary
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.200]   doubts, but in the midst of a healthy mind and clear theology, I'd assume he was doing
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.760]   good in it.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.200]   And I could trust him and you can trust the same thing.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.080]   You can do the same thing.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.760]   It may take time.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.480]   And it will certainly take perspective.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.080]   Are you saying that cancer is good?
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.400]   Are you saying that my son dying is good?
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.280]   I'm saying that your son dying on an instrument of torture in the midst of public
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:40.640]   humiliation, being stabbed in the side, nails in his hands and feet, crown of thorns on
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.280]   his head is good.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.760]   You think God doesn't know suffering?
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.640]   I'm saying that if you want to know that God loves you, you need to look no further
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:24:03.200]   than what he did for you, to purchase you, to adopt you, to know you, to converse with
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.600]   you, to have a relationship with you.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:14.400]   So that you might ask, seek, and knock, and trust.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.560]   The gospel is how you know God is good.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.280]   Let's have some real talk real quick.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.960]   Right now, there's got to be questions coming in your mind.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.760]   I've got a friend, his name is Daniel.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.840]   He and his wife, Kelly, got pregnant.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.440]   Anytime somebody's pregnant, we celebrate.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.800]   He's on staff with me.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.240]   Pregnant, celebration, yay, cue the streamers.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.720]   Daniel's pregnant, awesome, baby's coming.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.800]   Daniel goes and gets the sonogram.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.240]   Doctor says, "Hey, your baby has a chromosomal disorder called trisomy 18."
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:47.200]   What?
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.000]   "It's not compatible with life."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   What does that mean?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.480]   It means your baby's going to die in the womb or just outside the womb.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.920]   What?
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.120]   That feels like a stone.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.160]   That feels like a snake.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.720]   How, God, how can you do that?
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.320]   I can't see how that's a loaf or a fish.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.360]   It certainly feels like a stone or a snake.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.720]   God, how is that good?
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.800]   I met with Daniel and I asked him, I said, "Hey, I just want to ask you a question, buddy."
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:28.320]   I said, "Do you feel the freedom to ask God to present Abel to you?"
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.280]   That's his son's name.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.720]   He's healthy, made perfectly in his image, free from any chromosomal disorder.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.880]   Do you feel the freedom to go to God and beg him to give you a healthy son?
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.320]   Now, we're right in the middle of this.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.920]   This isn't something that's going to happen.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.640]   This is right now.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.680]   He answered me really honestly.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.880]   He said, "Kind of."
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:50.080]   I said, "What do you mean by kind of?"
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.080]   He said, "Well, if I ask according to his will."
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.160]   That's just not what I see here.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.360]   That's not what I see here.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.320]   What I see here is you go to God and you beg him.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:07.440]   If you pound the pavement, you beg him consistently every waking hour, "Lord, please, I want to
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.080]   meet you.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.960]   I want to meet you."
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.400]   Every waking hour, "Lord, please, I want to meet Abel.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.160]   I want to meet my son.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.080]   I want to hold him.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   I want to throw baseball with him.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.760]   I want to see him graduate, God.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.360]   I want to meet my son.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.000]   God, would you please give me a healthy son?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.800]   That's what I want."
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.480]   Lord, whatever you do, not as an asterisk or some superstitious add-on, whatever you
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.800]   do, I will steward to the best of my ability for your glory and your honor.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.200]   But if you want to know what I want, I want a son.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.040]   That's what I want.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:43.280]   I think the scripture gives you the freedom to say that.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.520]   Daniel sent this email to the staff.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.720]   Here's an excerpt from his email from a book he was reading.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:54.160]   "In my prayer times, there seemed to be two options available to me as a believer, each
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.320]   justified in the scripture, but polar opposites.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.960]   I could accept this tragedy as my lot in life, passing through the hand of the only one able
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.840]   to change things.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.640]   That's God.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.480]   For it is he who is in control of all things, sovereign and at work and in the midst of
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.440]   every good gift and terrible occurrence.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:15.760]   I could resign myself to an inevitable outcome, and my prayer would be that he be near to
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.800]   us, not to overwhelm us and to fulfill us with his claims in our time of need."
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.840]   That's a great prayer.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.800]   "And I prayed that."
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.920]   That's a great prayer.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.440]   "Yet despite how plausible and appropriate such a prayer seemed, I was unable not to
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.040]   append a cry for more.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.800]   And so I did.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.400]   My life of faith in Christ told me to believe against rational leanings otherwise, that
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.760]   God was able and that he actually requested me to ask him the impossible, all with the
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.840]   believing heart of a child.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.600]   He would have to tell me no, and it would not be for lack of asking if he refused the
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.200]   answers that I sought.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.040]   I would beg for healing or misdiagnosis.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   Any miracle would suffice.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.160]   I asked that the nursery be needed, prayers lasting for long stretches but containing
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.280]   very few words.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.600]   Please let us know this child.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:14.880]   It is my logic, my simple mind that tells me the Lord does not want us to have a baby
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.000]   with trisomy 18.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.160]   But beyond my logic, I asked maybe why.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:25.760]   And I could conceive of a situation where he would be trying to spare that child of
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:33.200]   something, some hardship in life or something that lays ahead or and or that he would entrust
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.480]   to this couple, a suffering to steward for his glory.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.760]   In fact, that article I just read comes from someone in the exact same situation who put
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.480]   out a YouTube video where 5 million people saw and heard the gospel.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.440]   Because of this child's life.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.080]   And so as Daniel read that, he was motivated to pray differently.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:03.280]   And I tell it to you so that you might pray differently, because I know so many people
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.160]   that say, hey, that was the hardest thing I ever went through, but I wouldn't change
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.480]   a thing.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.920]   I know a man that was born with no arms and no legs that became the greatest blessing
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.720]   in his life that he had no arms and no legs outside of knowing Christ.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.800]   I know another dear friend of mine whose son was born with Down syndrome, and he would
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.280]   say the greatest blessing in his life outside of knowing Jesus was his son Noah with Down
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.240]   syndrome.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.640]   When it looked like a snake and a stone, God said, no, it's a loaf and a fish.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.360]   Give it time.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   Tim Keller says, God either gives us what we ask for.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.560]   Or gives us what we would have asked if we knew everything he knows.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.200]   Verse 12, so in everything due to others, what you would have them do to you for this
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.880]   sums up the law and the prophets.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.480]   That's a big two letters right up front.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.440]   It says so.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.400]   So as, as you know this about God, your father in everything, because so therefore in everything
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.120]   due to others, what you would have them do to you for this sums up the law and the prophets.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.960]   My third and final point is that God often answers prayers through people that you might
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.040]   be the answer to someone else's prayers, or at least have the means to answer someone
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.200]   else's prayers by the way you do good to them.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.760]   That God may have you where you are.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.720]   Let me say that differently.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.440]   God certainly has you where you are when you are there for a reason and purpose to use
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:29.940]   you.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:35.440]   And so if your father gives good to those who ask him, then what would his children
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:35.840]   do?
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.440]   They ought to do the same.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.920]   If your father in heaven, your perfect father.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.000]   Gives good to those who ask him, then his children, his reflection should do the same
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.500]   thing.
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.160]   So you might be the answer to someone else's prayer.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:55.440]   George Mueller was a well-known Christian in the 1800s.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.760]   Well-known because of two reasons, his kindness to orphans and his prayer life.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.160]   Notably, he cared for over 10,000 orphans in his lifetime.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.240]   He was not a wealthy man, but known for his kindness and his prayer life.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.600]   There are lots of stories about like similar to the one I'm about to tell you.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:25.040]   On particular day, he sets the table for a mealtime for dinner and there's no food in
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.540]   the cupboard.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.320]   There's no food in the pantry.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.280]   They're empty, right?
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.440]   And his kids are sitting there at the table.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.680]   And so he goes to pray to God for the food that they are about to receive, yet they have
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.480]   no food.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.400]   And he says, Lord, we thank you for the food we are about to receive.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.120]   And as he says, amen, there's a knock at the door and it's a baker from a nearby bakery
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.360]   who says, last night I had a dream that the Lord wanted me to come and provide this food
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:49.840]   for you.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.560]   And he gives them enough bread and baked goods for everyone there until their bellies
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.040]   are full.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.240]   And that's not all.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.280]   At that same time, a milk truck goes by and breaks down and he then comes to the door
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.040]   and says, my truck is broken down.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.960]   Do you have need for all of this milk?
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.680]   As George Mueller with empty cupboards, prayed to God for the food that he was about to receive.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.120]   This is the faith that marked his life, the prayer life that marks life.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:15.920]   And you know what?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.280]   As you think of that, it's like, well, that's true.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.800]   In the 1800s, cool one man.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.720]   No, I hear those stories all the time.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.200]   I mean, whether it's like there's one particular one, I didn't have enough money to go to
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:25.520]   college.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.880]   I needed this exact amount.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.440]   And, you know, these guys come around me and said, hey, we felt compelled to give you this.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.480]   Another one said, hey, I was going to go on this international trip.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.400]   I needed exactly $1,700.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.120]   We got in a room, we prayed.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.640]   Everyone said they would give this amount.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.040]   And when I added it up, it was exactly $1,700.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.360]   People who wanted to go to launch, but I couldn't afford a ticket.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.120]   And then someone lo and behold, just says, hey, the Lord put it on my heart to provide
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.080]   for you a way to go.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.160]   Because their prayers were answered through people.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.800]   Do you see that?
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.480]   Anywhere you see the golden rule, it's in a negative form.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.200]   Do not do unto others as you would not want them to do to you.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.160]   But God says, no, no, let's focus on what you should do.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.120]   Meet the needs of others.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.080]   Care for others.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.200]   These are from some of my favorite stories of just being here.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.120]   People all around you have prayers they need answered.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:31.760]   And you might be the agent that God uses to display his goodness and his love to them.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:38.000]   And so in summary, in summary, pray with persistence.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.760]   Pray to a perfect father.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.240]   And be a person who God uses to answer the prayers of others.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:55.600]   The reason that I felt compelled to meet with my friend Daniel
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.280]   was because I had been in that situation.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.040]   And shortly after Monica and I were married, some of our closest friends called us.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.280]   We had just recently celebrated their pregnancy, and they said they were just leaving the doctor
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.080]   and their child had been diagnosed with trisomy 18.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   She had cysts on her brain, holes in her heart, dilated kidneys, and clubbed feet.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.000]   They then brought in a specialist that looked at this information, trisomy 18 specialist,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.480]   and he said, "Yes, this is the situation, but here's the deal.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.560]   We can take the child, and you guys can try again."
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.800]   And they said, "No, we cannot abort this baby because of our faith.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.840]   We don't know, you know, but we believe in a God.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.040]   We can't do this."
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.320]   And they said, it was terrible bedside manner.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.440]   They said, "You don't wanna carry a baby for nine months that you won't get to hold
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.680]   or play with.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:54.320]   Don't do this."
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.360]   And they said, "No, we will."
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.200]   And their community gathered around them, and we prayed.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.640]   We begged God.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.520]   We pleaded with Him.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.600]   "Lord, we wanna meet Rayleigh.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.280]   Father, we wanna know Rayleigh.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.520]   God, why wouldn't you want us to know Rayleigh?
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.160]   Lord, we will steward whatever suffering you have."
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.520]   Do you guys know what I mean by steward?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:26.720]   "We will make the most of, we will use it to your glory and honor and your benefit.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.680]   We will trust you in the suffering that you're at work.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.480]   We will steward it as best as we can."
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:37.360]   That's all you can do with suffering is steward it to the best of your ability.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.720]   "Lord, if you take this child, we will steward our suffering.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.560]   But Father, we wanna meet her.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.760]   We wanna play with her.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.960]   We wanna know her.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.880]   We wanna hold her, laugh with her."
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.440]   And Rayleigh was born.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.080]   Here's a picture.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.080]   We didn't know what that would be.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.120]   And they said, "Oh, lo and behold, the holes in the heart healed themselves and the cysts
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.760]   on the brain are gone and the kidneys seem fine.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.040]   She's just born with club feet."
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.880]   And they sent my friend, Mike and Erica, to Scottish Rite Hospital to a specialist with
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.440]   club feet.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.160]   And she got there and he said, "What are you doing here?
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.640]   Go home.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.000]   Your baby doesn't have club feet."
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.600]   And here's a picture of Rayleigh today.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:27.440]   [Applause]
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.960]   Hey, can I just tell you something?
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.720]   If God takes Rayleigh to night in her sleep, he's still good.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:41.280]   If God takes her into his kingdom tonight, welcomes her in, I mean, how selfish am I
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.240]   gotta be to say that's the worst thing that could happen to Rayleigh?
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.200]   God, I trust you in that.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:47.840]   I'm sad.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.880]   I'm mourning.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.000]   It hurts so bad.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.400]   But Lord, I trust you.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.520]   You're a good God.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.560]   I got a little bit of life on this earth and I'm gonna live it for you.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:01.200]   I trust you.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:07.840]   I know the Lord has given you some, some of you, some terrible things to steward.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.320]   And you haven't stewarded them in your sadness.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.400]   You stayed there in a state of grieving and anger.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:24.720]   And he says, "Man, I want to show you that it's a loaf or a fish, something that you
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.640]   can use to feed others in their time of need.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.880]   Will you let me show you that?
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.440]   Will you let me show you that?
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.280]   And if you think I can't empathize in your suffering, will you look to the cross where
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.200]   he watched his son die slowly and painfully?"
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.280]   In an effort to simply show you that he loves you and he forgives you.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.800]   I'm not delusional.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.640]   I'm not just pretending it's okay when it's not.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:04.320]   I'm not looking at bad situations and calling them great when they feel bad and awful and
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.840]   I really think they're awful.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.960]   I'm just saying I trust God is good.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.160]   Let me say that differently.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.560]   I know God is good.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.200]   He can't give snakes.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.440]   He can't give stones.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.320]   And so if I have something that's a snake or a stone, I'm just gonna assume I need some
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.280]   time to gain perspective and trust him.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.600]   Let me pray.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:40.000]   Father, you're a good father.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.280]   You're a good father.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   You give good to us.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.080]   Lord, help us to believe that.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:56.640]   Help us to look to your son, Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for our sins, not by
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:03.360]   accident, but by your plan, according to your will, so that you might break him out of the
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.440]   grave to display an empty tomb and the hope that we have that we can know that we're gonna
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.880]   be with you forever and ever and ever in your kingdom.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:23.280]   Lord, help us believe you're a good father, a perfect father who desires to give good
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.160]   to his children.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.880]   And help us to know you.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.400]   Even now.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.640]   God, I pray for Daniel and Kelly and Abel.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:45.920]   God, I pray that you would heal that child inside of her womb, that it would be a misdiagnosis.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.000]   Any miracle, anything that you choose to do will be fine.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.840]   God, we want to meet Abel.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.040]   We want to know him.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.240]   We want to laugh with him and hold him and play with him.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.680]   Lord, would you do that?
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.800]   That is what we want.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.320]   Please do that.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.160]   And father, this is not an asterisk.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.960]   This is not an and but or this is listen, we'll steward whatever you choose to give
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.560]   us, trusting that it's not a snake, trusting that it's not a stone, trusting it is a fish
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.280]   or a low, something that we can use for your glory and honor, something that we can delight
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.000]   in somehow, some way with perspective.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.040]   We will steward that Lord, but we beg you God, sovereign Lord, we plead with you.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.880]   Please give us a healthy baby boy.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.960]   You're a good father.
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.160]   Just help us to know that.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:45.360]   The phrase echoing in my head is is an interesting one from the Texas and though you're wicked
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.440]   and I just think about how much I love my kids.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:55.360]   I mean, if you tried to give my kid a poisonous serpent, I would wrap it around your neck
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.160]   and choke you out.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.960]   I mean, I love him.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.000]   I'm crazy about him.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.840]   And like, I don't even I don't after reading the text, I don't know that God, you know,
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.680]   the way that I let Finley eat that hot chocolate thing.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.880]   I don't even think God would do that.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.400]   I don't think you could do that.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.240]   He's like, no, you just I'm not going to let you do that.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.440]   Like, I want to give you good.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:28.320]   And let me redeem the brokenness in the world in the way that you steward that which you
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.520]   think that you don't want.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.480]   Let me show you that you can trust me.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.520]   He answers those prayers.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.720]   He hears them and he answers them.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:45.280]   And he wants you to ask what you want while you seek what he wants, seeking what he wants.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.080]   But be honest with him.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.160]   He desires a relationship with you only.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:53.280]   A relationship with you, not this check the box thing, but like a daily conversation,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:59.440]   ongoing conversing with you, a relationship, one that's that requires maintenance.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:05.600]   I remember being in this room and there was like a section of people just like right here.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.840]   That's all that showed up on Tuesday nights.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.840]   And can we turn the lights up and turn the lights on?
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.800]   And and I remember with this little section of people, I was like, I'm going to go to
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.480]   and I remember with this little section right here, I said, here's what I want you guys
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:20.960]   to do.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.520]   Okay.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.520]   And I said, and I had everyone turn around and because everything else was empty, all
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.680]   of that, there were no people up there and there and there.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.880]   And in fact, can we just do that?
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.160]   Just just you guys right here.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.120]   If you're on the floor, can you just turn around and look that way?
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.480]   And you could keep looking that way.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.840]   And I just want to tell you something that that you keep looking that way, because I'm
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.760]   going to talk to you for just a minute as you do.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.400]   Did you know?
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.880]   Did you know that that, you know, college students, you know, they sneak in here during
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.360]   the summer.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:53.920]   We know that you do if you're listening and and they're about to go back to school.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.120]   And they're about to make room.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:00.480]   And so here's what happened when when this little group of people turned around.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.600]   I said, can we just pray?
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.240]   Can you find a seat up there that's empty?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.680]   And you pray that one of your pagan friends, you know, that that you one of your old drinking
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.280]   buddies or whoever they are that don't know God.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.000]   Would you just pray that they would fill a specific seat?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.120]   I said, look at a seat and pray that they would be sitting in it.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:17.840]   And we did.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.280]   And is that not an answer prayer?
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.760]   I'm not saying all you guys up there are pagans or anything.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.440]   Let's thank God for that answered prayer.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:37.680]   And I tell you that because he may make space again as some friends return to universities
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:45.120]   around this country for you to go to a coworker and say, hey, will you come and see not the
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:52.960]   porch, but my Jesus learn from the scriptures here with the Lord might want to say to you.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:57.360]   And so our friends gathered in Houston, they just text us this photo.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.400]   That's them in Houston.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.760]   Pretty awesome.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.960]   If you know someone in Houston.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.760]   Yeah, praise God.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.800]   They're going to gather every Tuesday night.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:14.960]   And so, listen, if you're here and you don't have other brothers and sisters who can pray
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.640]   for you, other brothers and sisters who can meet your needs, other people who are Christians.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.880]   If you're a guy, we do have open community group.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.600]   You can go down this corridor right here in a room and there'll be guys that would love
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.320]   to get to know you.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.560]   If you're a girl, you can walk down this hallway and there's a room there of girls that would
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.600]   love to get to know you.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.200]   But everyone has a profession.
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.320]   I say that most of you, most everyone here tonight has some job that they will return
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.600]   to tomorrow.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.120]   And we want to help you be on mission in that place, whether you're a teacher or an engineer,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.760]   a scientist, or whatever you do.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.240]   Okay.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.560]   I don't know what you do, but a barista, I don't know what you do.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.520]   You're an artist.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:53.840]   Okay.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.680]   Of sorts, a graphic designer, a software engineer, you work in computers, technology, a consultant.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.480]   Okay.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.440]   We're going to gather, do this deal tonight called affinity groups.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.680]   And so that you can go and sit with other people that do your exact profession and hear
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   them talk about how they live on mission.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.200]   And so here's a kind of map that's going to be up on all of the TVs.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.040]   You can go and look at it and find out where you to go.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:20.320]   But I would just invite you to hang out for a few more minutes with us and gather with
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.040]   other people who do the same thing that you do.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:26.240]   And if you heard something tonight where you're like, Hey, I don't think God is good.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.560]   I'm telling you, it's the most unloving thing that you can think.
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.480]   And we would love to try and convince you.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.040]   Otherwise, please come and talk to someone in a red shirt.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.520]   Love you guys.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.040]   Have a great week of worship.
