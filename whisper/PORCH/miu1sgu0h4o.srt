00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,640
 All right, Porch, how you doing tonight?

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,400
 We are about to start four or five weeks together.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,320
 My name is Todd Wagner.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,600
 Some of you guys don't know me.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,680
 I get to hang out with everybody here on staff.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,640
 I spend more time probably with large groups on Sunday mornings

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,800
 than I do on Tuesday nights.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,440
 But every now and then, they let me dive in here with you all.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,040
 Can't wait to dive in with you at the launch retreat

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,640
 this year for the 1,000 or so of you that are going to join me

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,440
 there.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,680
 Get on the waiting list if you're not,

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,960
 because it always opens up in some way.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,440
 You'll never be surprised on that.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,080
 But we're about to take four or five weeks here.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,640
 And we're going to talk about questions that all of us have.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,360
 If you've got any kind of intellectual integrity,

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,680
 you're going to ask questions.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,080
 One of the things that absolutely frustrates me

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,640
 to no end is that people think that faith is believing

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,560
 something you know not to be true.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,900
 And people think if you're really

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,700
 going to be a person of faith, that you've

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,960
 got to be an individual that commits intellectual suicide.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,040
 But if you're a thinker, man, if you're a skeptic,

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,960
 if you challenge this supposed reality

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,800
 that this idea that has been passed down

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,320
 by men who want to rule you and control you and just kind

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,720
 of help you in your imbecilic state,

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,920
 kind of limp through life, then you'll ask questions.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,540
 And when you ask questions, man, you'll

37
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,840
 find out it's not what you think.

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
 And you'll start to learn and live on your own

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
 and make your own reality.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
 That's what the world often tells you.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
 That's what the intellectual elite wants you to believe.

42
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,140
 Let me just tell you something, man.

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,340
 The fact that the world thinks that faith is believing

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,500
 something you know not to be true isn't surprising.

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,580
 But the fact that so many people who hang out

46
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,340
 around a place like Watermark or a church

47
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,540
 still believe that is tragic.

48
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,260
 I want to tell you guys something.

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,560
 If something is true, then no amount of scrutiny

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,100
 can affect it.

51
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,020
 People that have something to hide don't like questions.

52
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,380
 I was talking to a guy who is part of a Hindu heritage.

53
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,580
 And he told me that when he was 10,

54
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,740
 he started asking questions.

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,980
 And his dad said, we don't ask questions.

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,820
 And they sent him to some different leaders

57
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,100
 within that specific expression of faith.

58
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,780
 And they go, hey, no one asks questions.

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,180
 It's a sign of disrespect to ask questions of your elders.

60
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,100
 Nobody's asked questions for 5,000 years.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,340
 And this guy started asking questions.

62
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,760
 And as he started asking questions,

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,820
 he found out that the faith of his Hindu belief system

64
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,780
 didn't hold up.

65
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,180
 But he asked questions.

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,740
 And he found out that the explanation that

67
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,780
 was provided by the God who reveals himself

68
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,300
 through the scripture, the God who reveals himself most fully

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,100
 through Jesus Christ, did make sense.

70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,460
 And that brother is no longer Hindu.

71
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,540
 Let me just say something.

72
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,980
 The opposite of faith is not reason.

73
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,060
 You know how you know that?

74
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,100
 Let's just work our way backwards, OK?

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,000
 What is the antonym of reason?

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,700
 It is irrationality.

77
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,260
 It is not faith.

78
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,700
 The opposite of faith is disbelief.

79
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,900
 Now, here's the question.

80
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,020
 We all believe something.

81
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,820
 The question is, have you asked yourself,

82
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,940
 why do I believe what I believe?

83
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,900
 Is it reliable?

84
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,020
 Is it true?

85
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,420
 If something is true, no amount of scrutiny will affect it.

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,660
 So we're going to dive in, man.

87
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,420
 We don't dance around stuff here,

88
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,500
 because we believe we live in reality.

89
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,900
 We believe we live in truth.

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,100
 Now, I'm going to tell you as we go that I

91
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,180
 can't prove everything to you.

92
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,680
 I mean, there's people who are going to argue with you about

93
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,940
 whether or not I'm really here, or if I'm just

94
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,820
 a figment of your imagination, and you're not

95
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,260
 in some Leonardo DiCaprio movie, and this is all an illusion.

96
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,740
 And you're going to have to sort that one out on your own.

97
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,240
 What I'm going to tell you, though,

98
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,740
 is that you can make a decision based on the preponderance

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,820
 of the evidence.

100
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,780
 And what you're going to find out

101
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,280
 is that we've got a faith, if you're

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,620
 a believer in Jesus Christ, and you follow his ways,

103
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,260
 and you understand the Bible as God's revelation,

104
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,300
 you're going to find out that you have a faith that

105
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,780
 does not go against reason.

106
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,140
 It is super rational.

107
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,860
 It goes beyond reason.

108
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,660
 It does require some belief.

109
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,580
 But I'm going to show you that your belief--

110
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,260
 we're going to talk about it in these weeks ahead--

111
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,300
 is we're going to show you that what you believe in

112
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,460
 is the most logical, and consistent, and congruent

113
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,820
 philosophy that you can have.

114
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,620
 It is the right way to perceive reality

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,060
 because it's real and true.

116
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,020
 Now, what we're going to do tonight

117
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,700
 is we're going to ask ourself this question.

118
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,100
 How in the world can we believe in a God that is good

119
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,260
 and a God that is God if this world is so screwed up?

120
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,220
 In other words, it's what's called the problem of evil.

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,940
 Theologians will call it theodicy.

122
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,140
 It makes up two Greek words-- the problem for justice

123
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,340
 and the problem of God.

124
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,780
 In other words, God is not just if he

125
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,140
 is sovereign over this world.

126
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,100
 Because if you haven't been paying attention,

127
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,860
 this world is rather screwed up.

128
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,380
 Amen?

129
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,700
 Amen.

 Well, that's the kind of movie you

156
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,820
 would expect for a skeptic to show before he stands up here

157
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,940
 and tells you why you are a fool if you believe there

158
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,060
 is a loving God who created this place, who cares about you

159
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,940
 and cares about this world.

160
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,820
 How are you going to answer that?

161
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,940
 What's your answer to that question?

162
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,180
 I mean, follow the logic here.

163
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,780
 If God is good, he would get rid of evil.

164
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,660
 If God was God, he could get rid of evil.

165
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,060
 Evil still exists.

166
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,540
 Therefore, either God is not good or he is not God.

167
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,700
 And quit wasting your time.

168
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
 And JP and Wagner and anybody else

169
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,580
 can stand up here and tell you all day long how good he is

170
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,060
 and how he's your shepherd, how he

171
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,220
 wants to leave you behind beside still waters and green pastures.

172
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,900
 But you are kidding yourself, and you've

173
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,500
 got your head in the sand if you believe that God is good

174
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,180
 or God is God.

175
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,420
 Right?

176
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,580
 Well, I don't think so.

177
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,260
 I'll take the other side of that position.

178
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,740
 What I want to do tonight is just give you

179
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,860
 what is called an apologetic, a reasonable explanation

180
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,620
 for believing that God is good and God is God,

181
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,540
 even while evil is still here.

182
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,820
 In fact, I want to let you know that God would tell you

183
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,220
 to not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you.

184
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,460
 God has said when he was here, hey, listen, in this world,

185
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,460
 you will have trouble.

186
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,660
 God explains where trouble comes from.

187
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,260
 And what I want to say to you is that I

188
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,580
 believe in a sovereign God who created everything.

189
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,340
 And evil is real, but God is not the author of evil.

190
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
 Now, wait a minute, Todd.

191
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,480
 That sounded logically inconsistent.

192
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,300
 I thought you told me that my faith didn't go against reason.

193
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,380
 You just told me that God created everything

194
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,420
 and that evil is real, and it's not an illusion

195
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,900
 like the Eastern mystics say.

196
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,860
 And yet, God didn't create evil.

197
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
 If evil is something and God created everything,

198
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,460
 therefore, God is the author of evil.

199
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,620
 And why would I want to worship a God who

200
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,500
 is the author of evil?

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,860
 One man said, if God is there, then he is my devil.

202
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,300
 What I want to do is let you hear from Thomas the Engine

203
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,020
 for just a second.

204
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,700
 That's an abrupt shift, right?

205
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,060
 No, from Fillmore in the movie Cars, right?

206
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,140
 You know who that is?

207
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,220
 From Rufus in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,

208
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,040
 you with me?

209
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,300
 All the same guy, his name is George Carlin.

210
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,900
 George Carlin, to a guy like me, when I was buying albums,

211
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,060
 yes, and was listening to great comedians,

212
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,020
 George Carlin was one of the great comedians

213
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,300
 of my generation.

214
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,580
 And I love George Carlin.

215
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,580
 He was hilarious.

216
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,740
 And he also prided himself in helping people in his humor.

217
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,660
 And he exposed government.

218
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,740
 He exposed corruption in his humor.

219
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,620
 And he exposed religion.

220
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,540
 Now, I want you to hear for about a minute 30

221
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,280
 from George Carlin.

222
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,500
 George also was very famous for a little bit

223
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,660
 that he did called Seven Words You Cannot Say on Television.

224
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,620
 And he was fond of all seven of those words.

225
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,900
 And so we have demarved this video,

226
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,580
 if you know what I mean, if you were here for the announcements.

227
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,100
 And so follow through.

228
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,740
 I think you'll follow the logic.

229
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,260
 But what I'm going to do is answer Thomas the Engine.

230
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,180
 I'm going to answer Rufus.

231
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,140
 I'm going to answer Fillmore.

232
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,740
 I'm going to answer Mr. Carlin.

233
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,100
 And I'm going to provide answers for you,

234
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,140
 because you're going to run into these questions.

235
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,340
 And frankly, the truth is, you've probably already got

236
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,900
 them.

237
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,580
 And here's the deal.

238
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,260
 You might just say, well, I just believe in God, man.

239
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,380
 The Bible says that I believe it.

240
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
 That settles it.

241
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:02,900
 That's wonderful.

242
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,380
 But you're going to run into an atheistic, nihilistic person

243
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,060
 someday.

244
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,420
 And they're going to look at you and belittle you.

245
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,340
 And what's going to happen is, if you

246
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,820
 don't have good answers to their good questions,

247
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,780
 it's going to create doubt.

248
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,260
 God says in the scripture, come, let us reason together.

249
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,580
 God says, I don't mind you asking me questions.

250
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,500
 It's OK.

251
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,260
 In fact, let me just say this before I get to Mr. Carlin.

252
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,060
 God's always had people asking questions.

253
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,540
 If you're a country music fan, right, you know Clay Walker.

254
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,420
 I don't think God was angry with Clay Walker.

255
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,540
 Walker wrote his song, "A Few Questions."

256
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,740
 That song starts this way.

257
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,060
 How in this world can we put a man on the moon

258
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,380
 and still have a need for a place like St. Jude's?

259
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,660
 I don't know if you know it or not, but this last week,

260
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,660
 about 150 kids from Watermark went up and worked

261
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,420
 at a place called Camp Barnabas.

262
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,060
 It was Adult Disability Week, where they cared for people,

263
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
 many of them nonverbal, who had been a wheelchair

264
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,340
 their entire life.

265
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,060
 My little 15-year-old girl was given stewardship

266
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,740
 over a 225-year-old, 225 pound--

267
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,020
 that would be really amazing.

268
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,900
 [LAUGHTER]

269
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
 In fact, you probably wouldn't have to care for her very much,

270
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,580
 right?

271
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,260
 No, a 225 pound, 30-something-year-old woman

272
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,100
 that she fed, they had to put filler in her water

273
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,620
 because she had swallowing issues.

274
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,060
 She had to use a hydraulic to lift her up out

275
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,340
 of her wheelchair, put her in bed, put her in the shower.

276
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,100
 She had to help her every time she used the restroom.

277
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,300
 And I went up there, and I was watching those kids work

278
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,640
 and serve, and I looked at that camp full of people

279
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,700
 who their entire life has been very, very broken.

280
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,540
 And you go, man, I don't need a chaos video.

281
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,580
 I see chaos right here.

282
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,820
 Where are you, God?

283
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,460
 How in the world can this be if you're a loving and good God?

284
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,380
 You know, we took care of those kids for a week,

285
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,020
 and then all the parents that cared for them 24/7,

286
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,200
 51 weeks out of the year, showed up.

287
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,340
 You think they asked this question?

288
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,660
 Well, let me just tell you this.

289
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,100
 The very first guy that I know asked the question eloquently

290
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,480
 was not a country-western writer.

291
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,060
 He was a Middle Eastern writer.

292
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,680
 Listen to this.

293
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,860
 This is the words of a guy named David in Psalm 13.

294
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,500
 He says this.

295
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,220
 "How long, O Lord, will you forget me forever?"

296
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,780
 Have you ever felt like that?

297
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,180
 "How long will you hide your face from me?

298
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,300
 How long shall I take counsel in my own soul,

299
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,700
 having sorrow in my heart all the day?

300
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,060
 How long will my enemies be exalted over me,

301
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,100
 that evil people are prospering, while me,

302
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,980
 who tries to do good, is suffering?

303
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,780
 Consider and answer me, O Lord, my God, and light my eyes,

304
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,780
 or I will sleep the sleep of death."

305
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,060
 In other words, despair will so overtake me

306
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,140
 that it's going to kill me.

307
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,700
 My enemies will laugh and will say, we've overtaken him.

308
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,380
 My adversaries will rejoice.

309
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,020
 Now, what you don't see behind me

310
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,340
 is that right here in that Psalm,

311
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,380
 there is this little Hebrew word, silah, which just basically

312
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,740
 means interlude.

313
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,460
 And what David did is he played on his harp at that moment.

314
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,860
 What I'm going to do tonight is play on the harp for you.

315
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,220
 We're going to take a musical interlude.

316
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,580
 And I'm going to speak to you with some melodious sonnet.

317
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,380
 I'm going to speak to you words of truth

318
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,300
 that I want you to meditate on, because God doesn't mind

319
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,420
 when you ask him questions.

320
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,380
 But here's the deal.

321
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,100
 God doesn't want you to rail on him.

322
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,860
 There's a difference between coming to him

323
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,220
 and asking questions and railing on God

324
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,220
 and telling him what you know about what he should be doing

325
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,700
 and giving God orders, because you know better than God

326
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,940
 what's going on.

327
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,140
 What David did is he asked the question,

328
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,820
 and then he just took a little time.

329
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,660
 And he meditated.

330
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,220
 And he went back over the character and nature of God.

331
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,900
 And he basically ended that little Psalm, and he said this.

332
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,460
 "I have trusted in your loving kindness,

333
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,340
 and I will rejoice in your salvation.

334
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,460
 I will sing to you, because you have doubt bountifully with me."

335
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,140
 And so there's a lot I don't understand,

336
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,660
 a lot that's going on I don't see.

337
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,460
 But at the end of the day, when David really

338
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,060
 considered all that God said and all that God had done,

339
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,460
 he said, "I will trust you, and I will follow you."

340
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,660
 And my belief is if you pay attention tonight with me,

341
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,820
 you'll end up in the same place that David ended up and not

342
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,740
 Thomas the Engine.

343
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,660
 But let's listen to the questions

344
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,380
 that sometimes we wish we had the permission to ask.

345
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,880
 Roll this.

346
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,700
 If we follow that as a humor bit,

347
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,580
 he says he believes in Joe Pesci, right?

348
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,780
 Because Joe Pesci always gets the job done,

349
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,860
 is what Carlin goes on to say.

350
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,220
 Now some of that's just funny.

351
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,620
 And a lot of it just rings true.

352
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,780
 We look around, and there's not a lot

353
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,500
 to argue with him when he says that.

354
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,580
 But let me just take some time with you,

355
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,380
 and let me just tell you what we're going to answer tonight.

356
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,840
 We're going to answer the question,

357
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,620
 is this the best that God can do?

358
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,020
 This world that we're in is evil on God's resume.

359
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,140
 Remember how we said that?

360
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,860
 This looks like the work of a bad office temp,

361
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,540
 an office temp with a bad attitude.

362
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,980
 Is evil on God's resume?

363
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,900
 Is God incompetent?

364
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,780
 Why doesn't God give a rip?

365
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,380
 Are you mindless if you believe in God

366
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,340
 with so much evil continuing under his rule?

367
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,540
 And is God short on compassion?

368
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,100
 You know, another movie that deals with this

369
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,620
 is a movie that Robin Williams is in.

370
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,380
 Robin Williams has a rant very similar to that.

371
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
 The movie's Patch Adams.

372
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,860
 I don't know if you've seen it.

373
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,060
 But in the movie Patch Adams, this guy

374
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,420
 who's a real figure in history, who loved people,

375
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,460
 was compassionate, and broke through some

376
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,980
 of just the stoic nonsense that's

377
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,740
 associated with so much of our medicine,

378
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,940
 was a really caring, compassionate person,

379
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,140
 who brought joy to people in the midst of suffering,

380
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,220
 loved this little girl, and she was tragically

381
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,300
 raped and murdered by just some expression of evil

382
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,980
 that he couldn't get his arms around.

383
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,300
 And there's this moment where Patch Adams,

384
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,720
 and the person of Robin Williams,

385
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,980
 stands on the edge of this cliff, and he says to God,

386
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,140
 what do you want from me?

387
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,380
 Answer me.

388
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,620
 Tell me what you're doing.

389
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,020
 Let's look at the logic.

390
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,620
 You create man.

391
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,300
 Man suffers enormous amounts of pain.

392
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,700
 Man dies.

393
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,540
 Maybe, just maybe, you should have

394
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,220
 spent day seven on compassion.

395
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,460
 Maybe you should have brainstormed just a little bit

396
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,060
 before you rolled this thing out.

397
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,300
 You are not worth it, he says.

398
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,260
 And he walks away.

399
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,780
 So again, there's the problem, right?

400
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,140
 And so we want to deal with this.

401
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,780
 And so I want to walk you through just

402
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,420
 some basic syllogisms, some logical constructs,

403
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,220
 and I want to answer them.

404
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,980
 People start by saying what Carlin says.

405
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,900
 Look, I reject God.

406
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,400
 If this is the best that you can do,

407
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,780
 I want nothing to do with him.

408
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,020
 And they start by saying things like this.

409
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,940
 There is no good purpose for evil and suffering.

410
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,980
 And they say that because they say

411
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,180
 that an all good, an all perfect, an all powerful God

412
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,020
 must have a good purpose for everything.

413
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,340
 And since there's no good purpose for evil and suffering,

414
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,020
 therefore there cannot be an all good, an all powerful God.

415
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,260
 That's another way to get at what I said a little bit

416
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,580
 earlier.

417
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,460
 Let me just tell you how to answer this.

418
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,780
 Carlin said, I tried.

419
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,340
 I really tried.

420
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,500
 I just couldn't do it.

421
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,700
 And for you to say you really tried,

422
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,620
 you've got to start by acknowledging something

423
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,980
 that's true about yourself.

424
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,460
 If you're really going to try, you've

425
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,980
 got to really acknowledge your limitation, right?

426
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,500
 Which basically starts with this.

427
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
 I don't know everything.

428
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,940
 There are some things outside of my scope of knowledge

429
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,040
 that I can't get my arms around because I'm a finite creature.

430
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,100
 I've got 70, 80, 90 years to figure this thing out.

431
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,780
 Look, Einstein, who clearly was one of the brightest minds

432
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,780
 that ever lived, he understood that he didn't even

433
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,580
 access all the brain that he'd been given,

434
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,220
 but he knew he didn't know everything.

435
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,460
 He, though, did reject the character of God

436
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,620
 as revealed in the Bible.

437
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,060
 And here is why.

438
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,200
 Einstein was what is called a determinist.

439
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,580
 He did believe in a creator.

440
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,660
 Einstein looked around and he goes, look,

441
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:21,060
 this world that we're in, creation and design

442
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,300
 demand a designer.

443
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,220
 There is a mind.

444
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,700
 He understood that every effect has a cause,

445
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,220
 and he believed in a divine causer.

446
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,700
 But he had a real problem.

447
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,380
 Understand, Einstein was a Jew.

448
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,220
 He saw what was happening in his lifetime to his Jewish people.

449
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,620
 He saw wicked men have immense power.

450
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,980
 He saw incredible suffering.

451
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,780
 And what Einstein became was a person

452
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,720
 who rejected the mind or the character

453
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,860
 of the God of his people.

454
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,140
 And he became what's called a determinist.

455
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,900
 And he believed that men were just basically wind-up toys.

456
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,980
 And we did exactly what we were just

457
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,740
 created to do by this God that he rejects because he doesn't

458
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,900
 have a good character because God would never wind up

459
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,420
 people to do this.

460
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,060
 He believed that men basically did what they did for the same

461
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,340
 reason that rocks lay where they lay,

462
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,580
 that somebody placed them there to do it,

463
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,660
 and that's just the way it is, and you just

464
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,540
 got to make the best of it.

465
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,580
 That's what a deterministic or fatalistic

466
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,680
 or a person who would take that philosophical explanation

467
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,500
 for evil, that's where they would come out.

468
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,440
 And that's really what I want to do.

469
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,560
 I want to start by just saying this.

470
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,740
 Look, you've got to start, if you're going to really try,

471
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,360
 you've got to start by acknowledging--

472
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,060
 I don't care if you're Einstein-- that you are not God.

473
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,240
 It's like in the movie Rudy.

474
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,180
 Remember that?

475
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,800
 When Rudy was struggling with why he wasn't getting

476
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,360
 to Notre Dame, why his body wasn't big,

477
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,440
 why he wasn't strong, he went to that little priest

478
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,460
 and he was wrestling.

479
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,760
 And the priest said, look, Rudy, I only know two things.

480
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,080
 There is a God and I'm not him.

481
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,640
 And I might suggest to Mr. Carlin,

482
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,160
 and I might suggest to Mr. Einstein,

483
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,400
 and I might suggest to you that that's not a bad place

484
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,920
 to start.

485
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,560
 Look, if I can explain everything God does--

486
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,120
 in other words, if my mind gets around everything that God

487
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,920
 does and why he does it and when he does it,

488
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,300
 then I don't need to worship him.

489
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,000
 I can explain him.

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,480
 I, in effect, own him.

491
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,280
 I don't worship my watch, even though I don't really

492
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,000
 understand how to build it.

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,780
 Somebody does, and if I spend enough time,

494
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,760
 I could figure it out.

495
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,920
 But it's arrogant of me to say to a Nobel laureate

496
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,120
 that his mathematical equation can't be true

497
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,400
 because I can't get my arms around it.

498
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,240
 And therefore, his math is science.

499
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,520
 I mean, his math is nonsensical because it

500
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,600
 doesn't make sense to me.

501
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,860
 And he's not a Nobel laureate.

502
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,440
 He's a Nobel idiot.

503
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,720
 What would you say to me if that was my reasoning?

504
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,320
 You would go, well, Todd, there's a possibility

505
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,040
 that maybe you don't know what he knows.

506
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,320
 And what looks like just a bunch of numbers and letters

507
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,680
 up on a chalkboard is really brilliance.

508
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,520
 And it looks like nothing to you because you

509
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,440
 don't have that mind.

510
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,960
 See, I need to take a position of humility

511
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
 because I'm not a Nobel laureate.

512
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
 And I want to tell you what, Nobel laureates

513
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,940
 need to take a position of humility

514
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,240
 because they're not God.

515
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,840
 There is no way that I can pour my five decades of learning

516
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,240
 into the mind of a three-year-old.

517
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,640
 Six-year-old, it starts to get a little close for me.

518
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,880
 But a three-year-old, I don't expect for them

519
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,680
 to understand it.

520
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,080
 And it would be crazy if that three-year-old said,

521
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,360
 I reject what you're saying because I can't understand why

522
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,640
 you wouldn't feed me ice cream for breakfast, lunch,

523
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,960
 and dinner.

524
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,160
 Therefore, you are a bad God.

525
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,560
 And I reject you.

526
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,520
 And I will worship the God of Blue Bell

527
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,560
 and serve him with all my heart.

528
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,640
 Now, I don't understand why a three-year-old would

529
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
 want to do that, the God of Skittles and Mountain Dew,

530
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,320
 if you put that in a sippy cup.

531
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,440
 But we would say the problem with a three-year-old

532
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,640
 is he's not taking a position of humility

533
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,480
 because there is nutritional value

534
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,040
 to what that 50-year-old father is saying.

535
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,880
 If you're really going to try, you

536
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,720
 have got to start by acknowledging that just maybe,

537
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,040
 maybe, there's somebody who knows more than me.

538
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
 And I'm not God.

539
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,200
 And just because I can't see the purpose for evil and suffering,

540
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,920
 it doesn't mean there is not a purpose for evil and suffering.

541
00:24:52,920 --> 00:25:02,240
 If you're going to really try, what you need to do

542
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,760
 is go and look at what the other explanations for evil are.

543
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,960
 Let me just give you a few of them, OK?

544
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,400
 I'll take some of the major views.

545
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,280
 I've already talked about Einstein's determinism,

546
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,720
 that he believed that evil was here because people were

547
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,120
 made to just do what they do.

548
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,560
 There is a God that's out there.

549
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,760
 He just didn't want to worship him

550
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,960
 because that God clearly created wind-up toys that

551
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
 did nasty things.

552
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,840
 And Einstein was glad that he didn't

553
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,360
 get created to do nasty things.

554
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,080
 He was created to build things that blew up nasty people

555
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,560
 and that helped others.

556
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,040
 But some people are what are called nihilists,

557
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,840
 that they believe-- or rather, naturalists and atheists.

558
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,160
 They believe in a closed system.

559
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,880
 They're really the reason that we're here.

560
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,640
 Einstein didn't say this, but many people

561
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,320
 believe that we're here just because of time and nothing

562
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,160
 and chance all of a sudden turned into something

563
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,360
 and order and design.

564
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,860
 And they're saying it just happened.

565
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,640
 We don't know why.

566
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
 It just is.

567
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,920
 And what they say basically-- and this

568
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,720
 is what Richard Dawkins, who is a Nobel Laureate, or at least

569
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,160
 is a well-known prof at one of the leading schools in all

570
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,960
 of England, says basically this to you.

571
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,920
 He says that you need to know that DNA just is.

572
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,320
 It neither knows or cares.

573
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,360
 It just is.

574
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,880
 And we dance to its music.

575
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
 And so atheistic or naturalistic people

576
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,680
 who think that there is no real explanation,

577
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,680
 it's just time plus nothing plus chance,

578
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,240
 and somewhere in there some matter came from somewhere

579
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,320
 that they don't know why.

580
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,400
 They can't explain.

581
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,960
 Dawkins, by the way, who's one of the leading

582
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,680
 new atheists of our day, when really pressed and asked

583
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,840
 where something came from, his best explanation--

584
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,720
 and I kid you not, go get the movie expelled

585
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,560
 if you don't believe me-- is aliens.

586
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,160
 To which, listen, maybe, maybe, but I would just

587
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,760
 say to Mr. Dawkins, what is your evidence for aliens?

588
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,760
 And let's talk about whether or not your faith,

589
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,960
 that that's your best explanation,

590
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,760
 is rooted in reason.

591
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,080
 Or maybe there's a better explanation for the God

592
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,880
 that I say that I love and serve.

593
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,760
 But third basic solution to evil is just shut up and take it.

594
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,160
 Survive if you want to.

595
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,320
 By the way, can I tell you, if I wasn't a Christian,

596
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,000
 I would be close to this.

597
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,700
 And what I would really be is a hedonist.

598
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,660
 And here's the problem.

599
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,080
 There's not enough intellectually consistent

600
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,400
 atheists, an intellectually consistent atheist that

601
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
 says DNA just is.

602
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,880
 It doesn't know.

603
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,760
 It doesn't care.

604
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,120
 You dance to its music.

605
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,600
 My question for them is, why are you putting up with any pain?

606
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
 That's why I would.

607
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 I would be a hedonist.

608
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,920
 I would do everything I could to milk all the pleasure I

609
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
 could out of life.

610
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,920
 I would abuse people, hurt people, take from people,

611
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,520
 use you for my own pleasure and my own advancement

612
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,320
 as long as I could in a way that I probably in some way

613
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,920
 govern so that you wouldn't lock me up or want to kill me.

614
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,520
 And then when it just got too hard for me,

615
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
 I would just check out.

616
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,920
 I would just check out.

617
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,640
 And by check out, I mean I would just

618
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
 move back to be food for the worms

619
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,360
 and get in whatever naturalistic cycle is coming next.

620
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,800
 I mean, why suffer at all if we're not here for any purpose

621
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,720
 and we don't really have any reason to hang around?

622
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,240
 Now look, Ernest Hemingway is an intellectually consistent

623
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,760
 atheist.

624
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,160
 Ernest Hemingway was an atheist.

625
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,460
 And that's exactly what he did.

626
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,080
 When wine, women, fame, and song no longer satisfied him,

627
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,320
 he put a shotgun in his mouth and he pulled a trigger.

628
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,200
 And he just moved on.

629
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,240
 But here's the problem.

630
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,080
 Is Ernest was making a wager that he

631
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,480
 was right in his philosophy.

632
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,720
 And I would have begged him to listen to his heart that

633
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,280
 told him there was more to this life

634
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,640
 than just wine, women, and song.

635
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,200
 And that in fact, death is not an end.

636
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,620
 It's an eternally fixed beginning.

637
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,800
 And I would have told Ernest, don't do that.

638
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,000
 By the way, that's why suicide is the greatest

639
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
 lie of the deceiver who doesn't want

640
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,000
 you to know the God that created and the God that is good.

641
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,280
 Because what he'll do is he'll tell you, don't listen to God.

642
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,980
 Don't follow God.

643
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,880
 Look at all the chaos in the world.

644
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,920
 Look at all the narrowness of God's claims.

645
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,560
 Look at some of the inconsistencies.

646
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,840
 He says this in the Old Testament.

647
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,640
 No one does that anymore.

648
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,280
 And now he's got these new ideas and all the different kind

649
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,720
 of stuff we're going to deal with.

650
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
 With you, science is much, much more reliable than his faith

651
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,480
 system and everything that we'll try and help you

652
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,640
 with in the weeks ahead.

653
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,160
 But here's the deal.

654
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,840
 What he'll do is he'll tell you to do what you want to do.

655
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,340
 Right?

656
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,840
 The Satanic Bible, the main idea in it is do what thou wilt.

657
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,480
 Right?

658
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,840
 Jesus would tell you that the golden rule

659
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,320
 is do unto others as you want them to do unto you.

660
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,200
 By the way, Confucius said it backwards.

661
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,760
 Confucius said, don't do to others what you

662
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,440
 don't want them to do to you.

663
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,160
 In other words, don't be a mean person.

664
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,480
 Jesus said, no.

665
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,440
 You be a lover, because I made you in my image.

666
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,100
 And I'm a lover.

667
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,840
 And you must care for others.

668
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,240
 So don't not do.

669
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,400
 I want you to do to them what you wish they would do to you.

670
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,120
 Serve them.

671
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,720
 Love them.

672
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,320
 Care for them.

673
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,540
 Be compassionate.

674
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,200
 Help them.

675
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,160
 But what happens when you don't do that, you live your life,

676
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,960
 and you get filled with a lot of despair.

677
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,440
 OK?

678
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,560
 And you start to find out that this life that you thought

679
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,100
 you would have by making yourself God

680
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,160
 and doing what you wanted didn't work out so well.

681
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,700
 That the Bible was true when it says

682
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,840
 that those who despise the word will be in debt to it.

683
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,460
 That the way of the treacherous is hard,

684
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,980
 like it says in Proverbs 13.

685
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,320
 And you'll start to want to go, well, what am I going to do now?

686
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,720
 Because now I'm filled with guilt and shame.

687
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,520
 Maybe I've got a long history of pain around me.

688
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,280
 Maybe there's some consequence coming to me

689
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,520
 I don't want to face.

690
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,720
 And then the enemy lies to you one more time and says,

691
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
 well, I'll tell you what you should do.

692
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
 You should be sovereign over your life.

693
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,560
 And don't believe that God's numbered your days.

694
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,220
 Why don't you just play the role of God?

695
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,840
 And why don't you check yourself out right here?

696
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,960
 And the reason he does that is because he

697
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,840
 wants to destroy you.

698
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,440
 He has come to kill, steal, and destroy you.

699
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,880
 Now, what I'm not saying right here

700
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,640
 is that suicide is ultimately the sin that you

701
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,960
 can't be forgiven from.

702
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,600
 But what happens is the scripture

703
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,560
 does say that it's appointed for man to die once.

704
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,840
 And after this comes judgment.

705
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,720
 And if you're a person who's made a decision

706
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,200
 that there is no God, and you shouldn't follow him,

707
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,900
 and you're going to do what you want right down to checking out

708
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,720
 when you are experiencing pain, then what he's trying to do

709
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,200
 is close the deal on the destruction

710
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,320
 that he has in mind for you.

711
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,560
 Which is why God is always saying, he who confesses

712
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,440
 and forsakes his sin will find compassion.

713
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,280
 But he who conceals it will not prosper.

714
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,080
 And so come.

715
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,960
 The solution to the atheistic naturalistic mindset

716
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,800
 is just, hey, grin and bear it.

717
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,760
 Hope you get more good than bad, but shut up and take it.

718
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,120
 That can be one solution for evil.

719
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,600
 They don't have a problem with evil,

720
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,160
 because in many ways, there's some

721
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,280
 of that Einsteinian idea of just deterministic evil

722
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,240
 that's in this world.

723
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,000
 And off they go.

724
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,240
 The second group is a deist.

725
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
 I'll do this very quickly.

726
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,840
 One of the things that you could say if you really try

727
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,760
 is you could evaluate the deistic idea.

728
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,160
 A deist is basically, in my mind, it's a chicken atheist.

729
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,240
 They really don't want to be an atheist.

730
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,040
 But what they say is, we may as well be here without God,

731
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,080
 because what God did is he created the world,

732
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
 and then he just left it.

733
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,280
 Determinism has some relationship to this.

734
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,800
 But it's the idea that what goes on out there

735
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,440
 is just what's going to go out there.

736
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,280
 And they wouldn't necessarily believe, like Einstein,

737
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,240
 that men are like wind-up toys, and some do this

738
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,160
 and some do that.

739
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,760
 What they would say is that men were here,

740
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,400
 and they've just got to figure it out.

741
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,040
 And so the idea of the enlightenment or rationalism

742
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,960
 would fall up underneath this.

743
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,080
 And the solution that they would offer for evil

744
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,800
 is education and advancement.

745
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,520
 And what we really need to do is we work our way

746
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
 through this, that the God who was good,

747
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,280
 who created us and left us in a good place,

748
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,200
 we screwed it up, and now we just got to figure it out

749
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,720
 on our own, okay?

750
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,960
 We're just here in this lab of life by ourselves.

751
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,800
 There's no one to rescue us.

752
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,040
 And so education and advancement is the best way

753
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,960
 to go about this.

754
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,440
 Some people might even say what we got to do is get rid

755
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
 of people that are not perfect and manage it that way.

756
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,400
 And so we get into eugenics and other kinds

757
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
 of things like that.

758
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,640
 Here's the problem.

759
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,960
 Would you guys agree with me just for a second

760
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,920
 that we've advanced in technology and science and industry?

761
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,200
 That we've advanced intellectually over the last

762
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,960
 couple of thousand years?

763
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,240
 How many of y'all think this is a better place?

764
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,060
 Is it working?

765
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,780
 Can we create our own utopia?

766
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:47,700
 Or do we just keep using more industry and technology

767
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,660
 to just further destruction and pain?

768
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,820
 Frankly, we use some of it to numb ourselves

769
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,300
 from the reality that pain is there,

770
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,540
 and that's one of the most dangerous things

771
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,380
 that you can do.

772
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,180
 Because pain is a gift, and I'm gonna explain that.

773
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,580
 I'm gonna tell you that there is a purpose to evil.

774
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,180
 Remember the very first little syllogism I said

775
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,620
 in this little section right here,

776
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,180
 which is that there is no good purpose for evil

777
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,260
 and suffering, I'm gonna tell you,

778
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,420
 there is a good purpose for evil and suffering.

779
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,740
 And some of you are in this room tonight,

780
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,900
 and you're very empty, and you're very alone,

781
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900
 and you're suffering, and you're angry at God.

782
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,740
 And I'm gonna tell you, this is not God's problem.

783
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,660
 Pain and suffering is God's gift to you.

784
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,340
 This is what it says in the Proverbs.

785
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,580
 It is not good for man to be without knowledge.

786
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,380
 He who makes his haste with his feet errs.

787
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,340
 The foolishness of man subverts his way,

788
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,540
 and then his heart rages against the Lord.

789
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,060
 Some of you guys are here and go, why am I pregnant?

790
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,860
 Why do men use me this way?

791
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,660
 Why is my life filled with despair?

792
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,660
 Why can't I get out of bed?

793
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,620
 And God's saying, because you're living a life

794
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,460
 that's gonna always steal joy from you,

795
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,660
 because you're not listening to the one who loves you.

796
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,860
 And that pain that you're experiencing is a gift.

797
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,460
 It means something isn't as it should be.

798
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,620
 By the way, I'll just prove this to you.

799
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,540
 When something's working, you don't think about it.

800
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,260
 How many of you guys got here tonight, had no car trouble?

801
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,180
 Right, a bunch of you guys.

802
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,300
 You didn't think about your car at all.

803
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
 You didn't think about your tires.

804
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,460
 You didn't spend any time thinking about it.

805
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,580
 Anybody here have a flat on the way here?

806
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
 Anybody here have car trouble today?

807
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,540
 Raise your hand in this room.

808
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,320
 Okay, a couple of you guys, right?

809
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,720
 You thought about your car, didn't you?

810
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,080
 You worried about your car.

811
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,940
 You spent time, because my car isn't right.

812
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,100
 When you are focusing on something,

813
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,620
 look, if you stub your toe,

814
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,880
 what all of a sudden you think about?

815
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,820
 Everything in you, like, I am thinking right now

816
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,780
 about my pinky toe.

817
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,500
 That's all I'm thinking about is my pinky toe.

818
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,160
 That pinky toe, the one that's going,

819
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,860
 (grunting)

820
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,180
 That one, I'm thinking about it,

821
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,920
 because it's not working correctly.

822
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,780
 So let me just tell you something.

823
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,420
 Do you know why you're thinking about yourself so much?

824
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,020
 Because your self is broken.

825
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:54,660
 It's not operating the way it was designed to operate.

826
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,500
 You focus on yourself, your ego is wounded.

827
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,020
 And so you're trying to fix it.

828
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,940
 And what God is going to say is,

829
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,700
 hey, it is broken, and it is wounded,

830
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,980
 but why don't you not think about how to fix it?

831
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,460
 Why don't you listen to the one that created it?

832
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,060
 I didn't break it, you broke it,

833
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,300
 but I can fix it, because I'm a gracious God.

834
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,060
 If you want to say you really tried,

835
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,900
 you would have to study pantheism or monism,

836
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,900
 and see if that's the solution that you want to go into.

837
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,860
 Pantheism and monism is just basically

838
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,660
 the idea that not that God created,

839
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,340
 but that all creation is God.

840
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,460
 Okay, that all is God, and God is all.

841
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:41,860
 Eastern mysticism has some attachment to this,

842
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,620
 and there's many religions that have this idea

843
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,660
 that really God, though, is mind.

844
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,620
 God isn't real, and you can't touch God.

845
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,820
 God is spirit, they would say,

846
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,480
 which is consistent with what the scripture says.

847
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,940
 But they would say that all matter is illusion.

848
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
 And they would have something like this.

849
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,700
 They would say, God is mind, okay?

850
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,860
 Or they would go, no material thing exists.

851
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,240
 So you say, what is mind?

852
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,620
 They go, no matter.

853
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,660
 And what is matter?

854
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
 They would say, never mind.

855
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,300
 Mark Twain, who I love, said that he came across

856
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,100
 an Eastern mysticist who believed

857
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,660
 that all reality was illusion.

858
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,700
 And so that means they think evil is an illusion.

859
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,620
 It's not really real, which is why one of their solutions

860
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,700
 for you to overcome evil is to meditate

861
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,300
 and get yourself out of this world that's broken

862
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,420
 that is an illusion, and just go ahead

863
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,300
 and move yourself to a nirvanic higher state

864
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,780
 where you can find peace, not subject

865
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,180
 to all the illusion of evil that you're in.

866
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,060
 Mark Twain said he came up against somebody

867
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,020
 who believed that, and he wrote him an imaginary check,

868
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,380
 and they sued him for very substantive dollars.

869
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,460
 In other words, that's a nice philosophy.

870
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,260
 I mean, one of the options you guys have tonight

871
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,400
 is to say that evil's not real,

872
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,580
 that none of this is real, it's just an illusion.

873
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,900
 And so you're gonna just kind of move

874
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,300
 to a higher state and get beyond it.

875
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
 And I'm gonna say to you that that's a fine philosophy,

876
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,900
 it's just not livable.

877
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,020
 Nobody lives like it's not real.

878
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,180
 You write me an imaginary check,

879
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,500
 and I'm an Eastern mystic, I'm gonna sue you

880
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,560
 for real dollars.

881
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,540
 You tell me that that hot oil you're pouring

882
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,860
 over my head is an illusion, and I don't care

883
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,420
 how much I'm meditating, I'm gonna have

884
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,380
 to do bidness with you at that moment.

885
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,860
 So pantheon and Moses, if you're gonna really try,

886
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,940
 you're gonna say I've looked at naturalism or atheism,

887
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,700
 I've looked at deism, I've looked at pantheism, monism,

888
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,000
 I've looked at finite godism or fatalism.

889
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,460
 This, by the way, is what Harold Kushner did.

890
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,420
 Harold Kushner's a rabbi.

891
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,460
 Harold Kushner's son was born with this disease

892
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,980
 called progeria, it's a terrible disease.

893
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,540
 It is a rapid aging of the human body.

894
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,620
 And Kushner, who loved God and wanted to serve God,

895
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,620
 looked at his son, who was rapidly aging beyond his years,

896
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,540
 and said no, a good God wouldn't let this happen.

897
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,780
 And so he wrote a book called

898
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,340
 When Bad Things Happen to Good People.

899
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,980
 You ever heard of it?

900
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,940
 He is a finite goddest.

901
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,980
 And what he basically believes is that there is

902
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:12,540
 a God that's there, he's just not really God.

903
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,940
 He's creator, but he's not infinite in his power.

904
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,500
 God loves us, but he can't stop evil

905
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,740
 from either existing or affecting us.

906
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,820
 Kushner's the one that said this,

907
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,540
 just because you're a vegetarian,

908
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,000
 it doesn't mean that the lion's

909
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,500
 not going to still attack you.

910
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:33,700
 And so basically, you've got a good God

911
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,600
 and you believe in him, but there's still this force

912
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,180
 that's out there that's gonna attack you.

913
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,180
 And so basically, Kushner's solution in all of this,

914
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,380
 the finite goddest solution is brace yourself.

915
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,700
 And it goes really to the other option that's out there,

916
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,720
 it's the polytheistic or the dualistic idea,

917
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,900
 which is there isn't just one God,

918
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,620
 there's a bunch of gods and they're at war with each other.

919
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,740
 There's good gods, there's bad gods,

920
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,120
 and they have conflicting plans,

921
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,180
 they're coextensive, they're coeternal.

922
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,380
 Evil is a necessary presence to struggle against,

923
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,020
 a force that we must reckon with.

924
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:10,180
 And you look at Greek mythology and Roman mythology,

925
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,420
 and what people basically do is they'll just say,

926
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,100
 look, what we gotta do is worship the good guys,

927
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,660
 cheer for them, feed them, and hope that they have

928
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,420
 more good days than bad days.

929
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,220
 And I would just tell you that none of those

930
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:29,220
 offer a logical construct that is congruent with our reality.

931
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,260
 What I wanna offer to you is this.

932
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,100
 There was another guy who I've been in the room

933
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,220
 with a guy named Christopher Hitchens,

934
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,700
 who wrote a book called God is Not Great.

935
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,680
 Christopher Hitchens was having a discussion

936
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,700
 with some friends of mine, and Christopher Hitchens

937
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,260
 listened to these guys give 10 logical reasons

938
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,920
 for the belief in the existence of God,

939
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,020
 including reasons that answered the problem of evil.

940
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,220
 And Christopher Hitchens, who wrote the book

941
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,940
 God is Not Great, much of it is filled with stories

942
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,540
 like in that little video, Chaos,

943
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,860
 that caused him not to believe.

944
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,020
 Hitchens said basically this, guys,

945
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,000
 can I just tell you this?

946
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,380
 What you said I cannot refute.

947
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,540
 What you said is congruent and consistent

948
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,420
 with the reality that I see.

949
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,660
 I can't argue with the resurrection

950
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,640
 as a historical, reliable event.

951
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,640
 I can't argue with divine stamp in creation.

952
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,720
 I can't argue with the cosmological,

953
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,140
 which is basically what I just said,

954
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,700
 the cosmological argument for the existence of God

955
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,860
 and a series of others.

956
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,360
 He said, but I just choose not to believe in it,

957
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,860
 even though I can't refute it.

958
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,780
 It's congruent with reality, it is consistent with logic,

959
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,620
 and it is supported by reason.

960
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,180
 But he just said I reject it,

961
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,860
 because I don't want to believe that.

962
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,380
 And so what I would say to Christopher Hitchens,

963
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,880
 and I would say to Mr. Carlin, is you're really not trying.

964
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,540
 You're what's called an obscurantist.

965
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,420
 You just want to suppress truth and unrighteousness.

966
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
 Now here's what we want to do.

967
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,060
 I just walked through some of the other solutions,

968
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,780
 but what about the Christian solution?

969
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,120
 I mean, what is that logical, congruent explanation

970
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,300
 that Hitchens heard?

971
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,140
 Because we've got to answer these questions.

972
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,080
 I just basically said this, this is the best God can do,

973
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,920
 and here's the answer.

974
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,340
 No, it's not the best God can do.

975
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,260
 God doesn't think this is the best that he can do.

976
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,860
 It's not what he intended.

977
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,340
 What the story of the scripture is

978
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,660
 is that we messed up what God intended.

979
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,160
 What God said was best for us, we jacked up.

980
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,100
 We didn't go his way.

981
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,020
 And he told us, listen, trust in me, I'm good.

982
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,340
 I've created a place that is called Edenic.

983
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,520
 It's paradise, it's perfect.

984
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,820
 You don't need to know good and evil,

985
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,700
 not because I'm afraid if you know good and evil,

986
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,220
 you're going to somehow run for mayor against me.

987
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,740
 But the reason I don't want you to know good and evil

988
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,340
 is because even when you know good and evil,

989
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,300
 you're not like me, you're not intrinsically good.

990
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,460
 You're made in my image.

991
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,340
 And I'll talk about why that's important in just a moment.

992
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,060
 But you're not me, you need me.

993
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,240
 I am the author and giver of life.

994
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,920
 Look, I created you, look around you.

995
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,280
 Is there anything that you lack?

996
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,460
 And the enemy said, oh yeah, there is.

997
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,800
 Is that good and evil thing you lack?

998
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,140
 And God said, there's a reason for that.

999
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,000
 And the reason is because if you know good and evil,

1000
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,320
 you won't always choose what I choose.

1001
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,300
 Let me guys ask you a question.

1002
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,880
 Some of the pain you've caused yourself,

1003
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,320
 you know the fifth time you slept with a guy

1004
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,520
 to find support, encouragement, and meaning?

1005
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,720
 And you thought he really did love you this time,

1006
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,020
 and it just didn't work out again?

1007
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,700
 And that because you called it an embryo or a fetus,

1008
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,540
 you could just abort it,

1009
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,480
 and you would maybe get away with it,

1010
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,680
 and you realized, no, it wasn't an embryo or a fetus.

1011
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,760
 I am haunted by what I did to my child.

1012
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,000
 It didn't work out again.

1013
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,480
 See, yours is not an information problem, right?

1014
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,320
 You know the right thing to do.

1015
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,600
 You know overeating makes you not like yourself,

1016
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,520
 feel lousy, and be filled with despair.

1017
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,140
 You know that drugs and alcohol don't really deal

1018
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,120
 with a hole in your heart.

1019
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,520
 I mean, it numbs you for a while,

1020
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,600
 but it doesn't make you feel powerful.

1021
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,060
 In fact, you do things that make you feel

1022
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,660
 even more powerless, and yet you keep making those choices.

1023
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,540
 That's not an information problem.

1024
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,260
 Knowing good and evil is not our problem.

1025
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,860
 The problem is is that we aren't able

1026
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,980
 to not do what we don't want to do,

1027
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,460
 because we're not intrinsically good,

1028
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,580
 but we have a God who loves us.

1029
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,420
 Now listen.

1030
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:14,400
 God does not have evil on his resume.

1031
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,420
 Do you remember what I said?

1032
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,580
 I said earlier this little statement

1033
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,980
 that God created everything.

1034
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,020
 This is James chapter one, verse 17.

1035
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,900
 James 1, 17 says this.

1036
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,080
 Every good thing and every perfect gift is from above,

1037
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,560
 coming down from the Father of lights,

1038
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,660
 with whom there is no variation or shifting of shadow.

1039
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,620
 So wait a minute, Todd.

1040
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,780
 You just said that every good and every perfect thing,

1041
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,140
 but you said God created everything.

1042
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,580
 You told me not to believe in Eastern mystics,

1043
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,420
 where they tell me that evil's an illusion,

1044
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,240
 because even evil is very real, so what do we do?

1045
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,580
 Follow me on this.

1046
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,500
 Here's the logic.

1047
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,360
 God is the author of everything.

1048
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,460
 The Bible teaches that.

1049
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,140
 The Bible talks about God's sovereignty.

1050
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,620
 It talks about how God's sovereign over kings,

1051
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,460
 or all people.

1052
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,700
 He's sovereign over nature.

1053
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,300
 He's sovereign over demons.

1054
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,700
 He's sovereign over history.

1055
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,060
 He's sovereign over nature.

1056
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,060
 There's nothing he's not sovereign over.

1057
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,940
 So I can't say he's not powerful,

1058
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,460
 because the Bible claims God's powerful.

1059
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,980
 The Bible claims it's good.

1060
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,220
 God created everything.

1061
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,140
 Evil is something.

1062
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,780
 Therefore, God must be the author of evil, correct?

1063
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,620
 No.

1064
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,540
 I'm gonna tell you that God is not the author of evil.

1065
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,580
 There's a guy named Augustine, and he said this to you.

1066
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,260
 He said that what evil is,

1067
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,780
 it's an ontological parasite that exists because God exists.

1068
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,140
 And you're like, okay, Todd, that's really helpful,

1069
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,660
 except I have no idea what ontological means.

1070
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,780
 Ontological is the study of being.

1071
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,740
 What's it mean to exist?

1072
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,180
 And what he's saying is that God,

1073
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,060
 who is eternal and always good,

1074
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,460
 if God exists eternally and is good,

1075
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,180
 there must necessarily be,

1076
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,660
 at least in the beginning where there was nothing but God,

1077
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,900
 eternally is good, the possibility of evil.

1078
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,780
 In other words, if God isn't good,

1079
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,140
 if God is just blah, then there is no anything but blah.

1080
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,420
 But because God is good,

1081
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,820
 the possibility of evil must exist.

1082
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,580
 If you say something is big,

1083
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,700
 what does that absolutely necessitate?

1084
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,820
 That there must be something of a different size.

1085
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,900
 And so what happened is there was a moment in history

1086
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,860
 that the Bible explains that evil moved

1087
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:29,700
 from a philosophical possibility to a practical reality.

1088
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,060
 Now, follow me.

1089
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,500
 Those of you guys that have studied physics understand this.

1090
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,460
 How do you create cold?

1091
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,100
 (audience mumbling)

1092
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,060
 See, cold is not really something.

1093
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,780
 It is the absence of something.

1094
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,980
 It is the absence of heat.

1095
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,820
 How do you create darkness?

1096
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,180
 Darkness is not something you create.

1097
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,020
 Darkness is the absence of light.

1098
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,860
 What's hatred?

1099
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,340
 It's the absence of love.

1100
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,220
 What's rebellion?

1101
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,500
 It's the absence of obedience.

1102
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,700
 What evil is is the absence of what should be.

1103
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,380
 When you take away God, what you have is non-God.

1104
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,340
 If God is good and God is life and God is light

1105
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,900
 and you say, "I don't want God.

1106
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,540
 "I want to go my own way,"

1107
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,620
 you have the absence of what should be.

1108
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,940
 So evil is not nothing, but watch this.

1109
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,540
 Evil is a no thing.

1110
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:31,100
 It's like the hole in the sweater that the moth ate.

1111
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,300
 We look at that and go, "That shouldn't be."

1112
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,820
 And I'm gonna say, "Yes, it shouldn't be,

1113
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,060
 "except there's these things called moths."

1114
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,660
 And what I'm gonna make a case for

1115
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,980
 is that moths, who have always existed

1116
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,140
 because God created them, didn't always eat holes in wool.

1117
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:53,060
 God, when he created, there was perfection

1118
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,460
 and light and love and there was no death.

1119
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,460
 What is death?

1120
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,940
 It is the absence of life.

1121
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,740
 What evil is, God is the author of everything,

1122
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:05,060
 and evil is something, but what it is,

1123
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,820
 it is the absence of what should be there.

1124
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,580
 Now, we still gotta ask ourself, where did it come from?

1125
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,700
 And the answer is, it came from,

1126
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,580
 the story goes, that God created because God is a lover

1127
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,420
 and one of the things that lovers must do

1128
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,460
 is share its goodness with others.

1129
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,660
 And so God created creatures

1130
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,940
 that he could share his goodness and glory with.

1131
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,700
 This is the story of the scripture.

1132
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,900
 Initially, he created the angelic realm.

1133
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,540
 And he shared his glory with them.

1134
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,700
 He even created provision for them

1135
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,740
 to be in the midst of his glory and not be consumed by it

1136
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,660
 because his glory was so wonderful

1137
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,460
 that it would be, they would be consumed

1138
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,740
 if he didn't make provision for them.

1139
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,500
 And yet, one of those creatures whose job,

1140
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,020
 if you'll study and look at the scriptures,

1141
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,100
 what theologians would say,

1142
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,180
 probably was even to reflect the glory of God

1143
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,940
 so other angels could see the image of God in them,

1144
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,100
 started to say, "They're not worshiping

1145
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,780
 "the image of God in me, they're worshiping me.

1146
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,940
 "And frankly, I think I can do better than God."

1147
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,260
 And so he tried to exalt himself above God

1148
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,620
 and over the rest of creation,

1149
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,500
 and God in that moment cast him out.

1150
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,180
 Now when God did that, the scripture says,

1151
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,500
 there was no question about his sovereignty and power.

1152
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,020
 But there might have been a whisper in heaven

1153
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,020
 with the two thirds of angels

1154
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,840
 that weren't cast out during the rebellion,

1155
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,140
 that maybe he's not really as good as Lucifer was.

1156
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,260
 And so what God did is he said he created again.

1157
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,780
 He went into that chaos and void,

1158
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,780
 into that area of judgment.

1159
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,960
 He created beauty and order and life.

1160
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,740
 And he placed into that beauty and order and life

1161
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,660
 creatures made in his image.

1162
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,220
 And he told those creatures,

1163
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,760
 "Enjoy me, walk with me, be blessed by me.

1164
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,240
 "There's nothing here that you lack.

1165
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,180
 "Just know that I am good.

1166
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,220
 "You don't need to know good and evil,

1167
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,500
 "you just need to know me.

1168
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,800
 "And I want you to love me.

1169
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,060
 "But I'm gonna tell you, there's gonna be an enemy there

1170
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,380
 "and he's gonna try and steal your heart from me.

1171
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,820
 "And the day you move away from me,

1172
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,160
 "you're going to move to death.

1173
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,080
 "The day that you don't believe that I am good,

1174
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,760
 "you will experience non-good."

1175
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,500
 The story of the scripture is that we bought that lie.

1176
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,220
 We believe that we could do better than God

1177
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,540
 because the enemy told us we could

1178
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,140
 and it fed our own little prideful self.

1179
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,860
 Instead of enjoying God, we started to create our own world.

1180
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,180
 And into that world comes all the things

1181
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,220
 that you saw in that video.

1182
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,160
 And it's not God's world, it's the world that we get

1183
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,260
 when we leave God.

1184
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,460
 This is not on God's resume.

1185
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,560
 In fact, God even says that all of creation,

1186
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:21,740
 which is now subject to us

1187
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,980
 because we were made in the image of God,

1188
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,620
 so he's given us a right to rule over this creation.

1189
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,180
 When we fell, creation fell with it.

1190
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,940
 And God said, "My creation is longing for redemption."

1191
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,980
 Now follow me on this.

1192
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:37,500
 You might say, "Well, God shouldn't have created

1193
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,340
 "creatures that would rebel against him."

1194
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,940
 And I'm going to explain to you why he did that.

1195
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,780
 Are you ready?

1196
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,040
 Follow this little syllogism.

1197
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,860
 Every creature God has made is perfect.

1198
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,020
 Perfect creatures can't do what's imperfect.

1199
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,380
 Therefore, if God created perfect creatures,

1200
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,300
 perfect creatures must only act perfectly.

1201
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,820
 You just told me God created angels,

1202
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,020
 they rebelled against him.

1203
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,900
 You told me God created man, they rebelled against him.

1204
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,020
 Those aren't perfect creatures.

1205
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,860
 Yes, they are.

1206
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,300
 Here's the solution to that little problem.

1207
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,900
 God made everything perfect.

1208
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,860
 One perfect thing that God created is free creatures.

1209
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,500
 Why did he make free creatures?

1210
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,420
 Because free creatures have the ability to make choices

1211
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,980
 and they have the ability specifically to love.

1212
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,820
 And let me say it this way.

1213
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,620
 One of the things that perfect creatures must do

1214
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,460
 is love.

1215
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,420
 In order to be able to love, you've got to choose.

1216
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,260
 You're not a robot.

1217
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,860
 I can remember when I was talking to my little girl

1218
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,340
 and she asked me when she was four years old,

1219
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,460
 "Daddy, why did God let us sin?"

1220
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,220
 And I just said, "Because he loves you

1221
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,020
 "and because he wants you to love him."

1222
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,100
 I said, "Ally, let me ask you a question.

1223
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,500
 "You got lots of stuffed animals in your room.

1224
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,100
 "You're the first kid, so all you got

1225
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,340
 "is more stuffed animals than any kid could ever need.

1226
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,900
 "Look around your room and I can tell you

1227
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,060
 "that you play with your little stuffed animals.

1228
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,300
 "You got names for all of them, don't you?"

1229
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,940
 And she went around the room and she talked about the names

1230
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,500
 she has for her stuffed animals.

1231
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,340
 She has for them.

1232
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,420
 I go, "What if I left you in this room

1233
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,060
 "and I told you that you could be God

1234
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,900
 "over these stuffed animals and you could always

1235
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,140
 "make them sing songs to you,

1236
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,380
 "you could always make them love you,

1237
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,140
 "you could always make them hug you.

1238
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,700
 "When you wanted to sleep with them and cuddle,

1239
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,540
 "they would always do it.

1240
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,380
 "They would never say no.

1241
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,180
 "They would be at your beck and call

1242
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,660
 "and they would never, ever once disappoint you.

1243
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,820
 "But Ally, you need to know something.

1244
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,660
 "They're not real.

1245
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,060
 "They're just stuffed animals.

1246
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,140
 "They can't really love you.

1247
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,900
 "They won't hurt you, but they won't really love you.

1248
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,220
 "But you can imagine they'll love you.

1249
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,620
 "Or you can be friends with Sally, the street.

1250
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,460
 "You can be friends with Maggie.

1251
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,820
 "You can be friends with Susan

1252
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,140
 "and you can be friends with Ginger.

1253
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,740
 "But you need to know something.

1254
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,780
 "Ginger and Susie and Sally, Megan,

1255
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,780
 "they can really love you,

1256
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,500
 "but they're also gonna maybe hurt you

1257
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,020
 "and disappoint you and let you down

1258
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,540
 "and not wanna spend time with you

1259
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,260
 "and say mean things to you.

1260
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,420
 "But which one do you want, Ally?"

1261
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,500
 And she says, "I want friends.

1262
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,340
 "I want real friends.

1263
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,180
 "I love my stuffed animals,

1264
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,020
 "but my stuffed animals don't really love me.

1265
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,020
 "What I really want is real interaction."

1266
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,060
 They go, "That's because you're made in the image of God.

1267
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,020
 "And that's why God gave you the right to choose."

1268
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:15,140
 See, one of the things perfect creatures must do is love.

1269
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:15,980
 In order to be able to love,

1270
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,860
 you've gotta be able to choose.

1271
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,140
 So to follow this little syllabus,

1272
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,060
 one perfect thing God made is free creatures.

1273
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,300
 Free will allows for the choice to not love.

1274
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,660
 We call that hate or rebel or evil.

1275
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,060
 Therefore, it is possible that a God

1276
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,220
 that created something perfect

1277
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,620
 out of that imperfection could rise.

1278
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,860
 I'm gonna move a little quickly with you here

1279
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,020
 and wrap this thing up.

1280
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,460
 What I wanna do is just share with you

1281
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,500
 just this little excerpt that explains

1282
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,660
 a little bit about why there is evil.

1283
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,940
 Because remember at the beginning,

1284
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,000
 I said to you that there's no good purpose

1285
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,840
 for evil and suffering?

1286
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,260
 I'm gonna tell you there is.

1287
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,780
 But let me just deal with this issue of power and love.

1288
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,320
 This is from a book by a guy named Philip Yancey.

1289
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,860
 It's called "Disappointment with God."

1290
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,780
 "Is God unfair?

1291
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,620
 "Is he silent?

1292
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,700
 "Is he hidden?

1293
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,580
 "Such questions must have troubled the Hebrews

1294
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,160
 "until in Moses' lifetime, God took off all the wraps.

1295
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,780
 "He punished evil and he rewarded good."

1296
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,740
 Just like we kinda want God to do.

1297
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,640
 "He spoke audibly.

1298
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,340
 "He made himself visible, first to Moses in a burning bush,

1299
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,740
 "and then to the Israelites in a pillar of cloud and fire.

1300
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,420
 "The response of the Israelites to such direct intervention

1301
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,260
 "offers an important insight into the inherent limits

1302
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,980
 "of all power."

1303
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,260
 Power can do everything but the most important thing.

1304
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,340
 Power cannot control love.

1305
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:34,160
 "The 10 plagues in Exodus show the power of God

1306
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,100
 "over a pharaoh.

1307
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,660
 "But the 10 major rebellions recorded in Numbers

1308
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,840
 "show the impotence of power to bring about

1309
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,020
 "what God desires most,

1310
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,720
 "the love and faithfulness of his people.

1311
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,640
 "No pyrotechnic displays of omnipotence

1312
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,820
 "could make them trust and follow him."

1313
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,340
 We don't need the ancient Israelites

1314
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,340
 really to teach us this fact.

1315
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,740
 We can see it today in societies where power runs wild.

1316
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,140
 In a concentration camp, as so many witnesses have told us,

1317
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,780
 the guards possess nearly unlimited power.

1318
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,700
 By applying force, they can make you renounce God,

1319
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,940
 curse your family, work without pay, eat human excrement,

1320
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,820
 kill and then bury your closest friend

1321
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,120
 or even your own mother.

1322
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,820
 All this is within their power.

1323
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,580
 Only one thing is not, they cannot force you to love them.

1324
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:18,200
 "The fact that love does not operate

1325
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,780
 "according to the rules of power may help explain

1326
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,380
 "why God sometimes seems shy to use his power.

1327
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,340
 "He created us to love him,

1328
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,740
 "but his most impressive display of a miracle,

1329
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,520
 "the kind we may secretly long for,

1330
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,540
 "does nothing to foster that love."

1331
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,440
 As one guy put it, "God's problem is not that God

1332
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,860
 "is not able to do certain things."

1333
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,340
 Watch this, "God's problem is that God loves.

1334
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,500
 "Love complicates the life of God,

1335
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,800
 "even as it complicates every life."

1336
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,140
 Let me tell you the purpose and beauty of evil.

1337
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,100
 Because we have seen evil, it makes us love what is good.

1338
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,240
 Pain is a gift.

1339
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,420
 At the beginning, we talked about this idea,

1340
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,260
 there is no good purpose for evil and suffering.

1341
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,080
 I'm gonna tell you, I don't ever drop on some persons

1342
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,580
 who are really in the midst of suffering,

1343
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,380
 hey man, all things work together for good

1344
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,980
 to those who love God and are called

1345
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,980
 according to his purpose.

1346
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,480
 By the way, that is very true.

1347
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,700
 But the Bible does not deny me the right

1348
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,780
 to mourn with those that mourn.

1349
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,240
 In fact, it commands me to.

1350
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,700
 It just tells me not to grieve as those who have no hope.

1351
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,300
 It tells me to do what David did,

1352
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,700
 to tell God, God, this is a beating.

1353
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,420
 How long is this gonna go on?

1354
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,940
 And then just to stop and rest.

1355
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,340
 And for him to go, I'll tell you how long it's gonna go on.

1356
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,340
 And I'll tell you why I haven't wrapped up

1357
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,220
 judgment against evil completely yet.

1358
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,540
 It's because I love people.

1359
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,140
 And if I'm gonna get rid of evil,

1360
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,780
 it's gonna be all evil, Todd.

1361
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,920
 Not just the evil you want me to get rid of.

1362
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,620
 In fact, everybody in this room would come in and say,

1363
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,820
 I wish God would get rid of evil.

1364
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,740
 And what you're really doing is if you have not

1365
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,740
 had your evil atoned for and covered,

1366
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,340
 you are wishing for your own destruction.

1367
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,140
 Because evil is not what you think is evil.

1368
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,160
 Evil is less than perfection.

1369
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:57,040
 Anybody here still wanna get rid of all evil?

1370
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,660
 If you're a fatalist or a nihilist, you should.

1371
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,060
 But see, God has made you in his image.

1372
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,180
 He said eternity in your hearts.

1373
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,500
 And that's why you don't put a gun in your mouth

1374
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,180
 and pull it like Ernest Hemingway,

1375
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,900
 who was very drunk when he did it.

1376
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,220
 Because you know something is true,

1377
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,340
 and that is that life is not over at the grave.

1378
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,580
 It's an eternally fixed beginning.

1379
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,900
 And what God says, I don't want life

1380
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,220
 to have to start for you at the grave.

1381
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,320
 That's why I want you to start experiencing life right now.

1382
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,540
 And pain is a gift.

1383
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:25,040
 It tells you something is not as it should be.

1384
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,920
 There's a guy named Paul Brand

1385
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,140
 that I recommend you guys do some research on.

1386
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:32,420
 And Paul Brand is the world's leading expert on leprosy.

1387
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,380
 Leprosy is a really interesting disease.

1388
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,460
 Do you know, by the way, if you go back and read

1389
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,860
 in Exodus where it's talking about skin issues,

1390
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,540
 it talks about leprosy and a disease

1391
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,340
 where it has to be put outside the camp.

1392
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,660
 When you see lepers in the Bible, it's a picture of sin.

1393
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,660
 Let me tell you why.

1394
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,300
 Leprosy is not a flesh-eating disease.

1395
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,900
 Leprosy is a disease that attacks the nerve endings.

1396
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,020
 And what it does is lepers can't experience pain.

1397
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,820
 What happens to a leper is they don't do what you do.

1398
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,440
 If you're sweeping a floor, you don't even know it,

1399
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,380
 but you just are constantly manipulating

1400
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,720
 that broom in your hand 1,000 little times

1401
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,620
 so it doesn't wear a groove into your hand.

1402
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,540
 Lepers don't care.

1403
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,680
 They never have to adjust the broom

1404
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,620
 because they can't feel it.

1405
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,100
 And what eventually happens is they rub their skin raw,

1406
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:15,940
 but that doesn't hurt.

1407
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,140
 Usually when you rub your skin raw,

1408
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,340
 you get a blister and you kind of go, that hurts.

1409
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,180
 And you address it.

1410
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,060
 Lepers don't address it.

1411
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:23,420
 And it gets infected.

1412
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,700
 And they don't even care that it's infected.

1413
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,460
 That infection is kind of ugly and slightly,

1414
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,820
 they'll just wrap it up, but they'll let it go.

1415
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,140
 Once it's out of sight, it's out of mind

1416
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,460
 because it doesn't hurt.

1417
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,820
 And what eventually happens, that infection then

1418
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,440
 starts to not just go into the flesh,

1419
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,100
 but eventually makes its way into the bone.

1420
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,700
 The only time a leper will call for help

1421
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,240
 is when the stench overwhelms them.

1422
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,320
 Then they'll go to somebody and say, this just stinks.

1423
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,600
 Would you address it?

1424
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,800
 And usually at that point in lepers,

1425
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,500
 it has gone all the way down to the bone.

1426
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,000
 What literally happens is it affects the structure

1427
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,880
 of the body and the skin pulls back.

1428
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,000
 And what you see is that the body literally eats itself.

1429
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,960
 It shrinks back.

1430
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,840
 You become less of a person.

1431
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,800
 Is that not a beautiful picture of sin?

1432
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:07,040
 That disease affects you and you just pull back

1433
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,260
 and you become less and less of who you were intended to be.

1434
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,840
 That's what it means when it says in the scripture

1435
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,520
 that we all become less than the glory

1436
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,020
 that God intended for us.

1437
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,520
 And see, when we see that happening,

1438
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:16,780
 God says, let me heal you.

1439
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,480
 That's why the only person that could heal a leper

1440
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,180
 in the Bible wasn't a doctor, it was a priest.

1441
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,020
 That's why the very first healing

1442
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:24,500
 that Jesus went through was a leper.

1443
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,020
 'Cause God has made new what no one else can make new.

1444
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,380
 What God does is he brings back

1445
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,940
 into our dead hearts feeling.

1446
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,940
 If you don't have pain, you don't know something is wrong.

1447
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,640
 And God gave us the gift of pain and chaos and suffering

1448
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,560
 so we would stop trying to create a utopia

1449
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,920
 through philosophers and some new political movement

1450
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,660
 or some new government messiah.

1451
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,120
 And we would pay attention to God.

1452
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,440
 Now what did God do in this world that turned away from him

1453
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,780
 that he brought judgment to?

1454
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,260
 Just like he said, that's omnipotence.

1455
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,960
 But what did we never see before evil entered in?

1456
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:07,220
 We never saw the love of God.

1457
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,020
 We knew nothing of mercy.

1458
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,780
 We knew nothing of kindness.

1459
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,780
 We knew nothing of rescue and redemption.

1460
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:18,420
 And God is revealing his goodness and his glory

1461
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,300
 in a way that we can go, rightly do we love you.

1462
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:26,820
 And rightly do we run away from this thing

1463
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,140
 that brings pain, this sin, this death, this deceiver

1464
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,060
 who tells us you're not there.

1465
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,680
 When in fact, the reason we're here

1466
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,280
 is because we've acted like you are not

1467
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,400
 what you claim to be from the beginning.

1468
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,000
 And in your kindness, you let us and our world

1469
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,120
 experience pain and death and child abuse and rape

1470
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,680
 and this beautiful creation to have chaos

1471
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,720
 because this world is not your home.

1472
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:55,080
 Now you might say this.

1473
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,800
 If God is all good, he would destroy evil.

1474
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,920
 If God is all good, he could.

1475
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,920
 Evil's not destroyed, therefore there's not an all good.

1476
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,760
 If God is all good, he could.

1477
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,880
 Evil's not destroyed, therefore there's not

1478
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,960
 an all good and powerful God.

1479
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,880
 But there's another way to look at this.

1480
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,640
 If God is all good, he will defeat evil.

1481
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,320
 If God is all good, he can defeat evil.

1482
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:15,320
 Evil is not yet defeated, therefore God will one day

1483
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,000
 completely defeat evil.

1484
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,120
 That's the story of scripture.

1485
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,160
 Scripture says that God does hate evil.

1486
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,340
 He's done something about it.

1487
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,340
 When he was here, he wept over the grief and suffering

1488
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,360
 that we experience.

1489
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,800
 He was tempted in every way as we have been.

1490
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,680
 He made provision for evil.

1491
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,680
 He became sin on our behalf and that he might

1492
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,940
 give us his righteousness.

1493
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,080
 The story of scripture is this world is broken.

1494
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,200
 God knows it's broken.

1495
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,520
 He wept at the effects of sin and he wept over those

1496
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,420
 that rejected him as the solution to their sin

1497
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,560
 because he loves men.

1498
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:00,300
 Do you know why God has not wrapped up judgment on evil yet?

1499
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,600
 The answer is in 2 Peter chapter three verse nine.

1500
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,700
 And it says this, God is not slow as some count slowness.

1501
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,980
 But is patient towards you, not wishing for any to perish

1502
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,740
 but for all to come to repentance.

1503
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,440
 I'm gonna tell you why God has not gotten rid of evil

1504
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,960
 because there's some people in this room tonight

1505
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,320
 that have never had their evil covered, atoned for.

1506
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:26,220
 And God loves you and the pain that's in your heart

1507
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,380
 and the pain that's in your world is screaming to you,

1508
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,820
 this is not God's world.

1509
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,200
 It's a world spun out of control away from him

1510
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,820
 and he loves you personally in it.

1511
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,420
 One day he's gonna redeem the world

1512
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,860
 and he's gonna take redeemed people with him into it

1513
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,860
 but for now, he is saying let me redeem you

1514
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,100
 and then he does this.

1515
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,940
 This amazing thing when you're redeemed by the God

1516
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,220
 who rescues you from sin and death is he says,

1517
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,540
 hey, now that you know that I'm good

1518
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,040
 and now that you can trust me,

1519
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,340
 I'm gonna leave you here in this world filled with cancer

1520
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,880
 and loneliness and rejection and adultery

1521
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,740
 and rape and poverty

1522
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:04,760
 and I'm gonna ask you to do what you can do about it.

1523
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,520
 I'm gonna ask you to be my hands and feet

1524
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,920
 and when you do it, I'm gonna tell you to tell others

1525
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,840
 that you do it not because you're doing some random act

1526
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,760
 of kindness but because you're worshiping the God

1527
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,320
 that wants them to know of his goodness

1528
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,640
 and you are here as his messenger.

1529
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,080
 And so Jesus says to you who have come to him,

1530
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,340
 hey, in this world you will have trouble but take heart,

1531
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,580
 I've overcome the world, this is not my world

1532
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:29,120
 but you are my people if you have accepted my grace

1533
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,020
 and provision for your sin and evil and suffering and death

1534
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:35,260
 and I'm gonna ask that you serve me for a while

1535
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:38,220
 and I'm not so unjust as to forget your kindness

1536
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:39,180
 that you've shown to the saints

1537
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,880
 and still ministering to the saints

1538
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,500
 and there's gonna be a forever where it's gonna make

1539
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,660
 this 60, 70, 80 years look like nothing

1540
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,860
 and I know it's really hard for you

1541
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,700
 and maybe your story is a wheelchair,

1542
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,340
 maybe your story is barrenness,

1543
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,300
 maybe your story is an abusive daddy,

1544
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,760
 I didn't want abusive daddies and wheelchairs and barrenness

1545
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,820
 but that's the effects of sin

1546
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,500
 and my grace is sufficient for you

1547
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:07,380
 and I wanna forgive you and I wanna make you heroic in it,

1548
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,760
 a messenger of hope.

1549
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,860
 That's the story, gang.

1550
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,100
 Evil not only does not disprove God,

1551
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,420
 it proves that there is a God

1552
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:25,700
 who's doing exactly what he said would happen

1553
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,860
 if we left him and God didn't just throw out some philosophy

1554
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,820
 he anchored his story in the context of history,

1555
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,580
 go check it out, the Bible isn't just some poetic idea,

1556
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,260
 it is a historical narrative of what God is doing

1557
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,380
 in revealing his glory so that you would want to know him.

1558
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,340
 The story of the Bible is not behave

1559
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,460
 and you might be saved,

1560
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,500
 the story of the Bible is God loves you

1561
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,460
 and is gonna rescue you from your disobedience.

1562
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:56,100
 Don't perform for me, let me provide for you.

1563
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:02,300
 I hate evil, I judge evil,

1564
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,300
 I pour out all my wrath on evil

1565
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,380
 and guess what, I know what it's like

1566
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,360
 to feel like I've forgotten, been forgotten by God.

1567
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:16,860
 Check this, God, why have you forgotten me?

1568
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,040
 Why have you forsaken me?

1569
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,580
 Because Jesus was found in the likeness of a man

1570
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,340
 and being made in the appearance of man,

1571
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,840
 humbled himself and became obedient

1572
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,780
 even to the point of death, death on a cross, why?

1573
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,740
 Because God hates death and suffering

1574
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,220
 because he's a God of love

1575
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,180
 and he wants you to accept his provision.

1576
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:40,840
 He wants you to join him in declaring to the world his love.

1577
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,340
 And he promises that one day he's gonna roll this thing up

1578
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:50,700
 and there will be forever evil

1579
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,580
 where there's nothing that will ever remind you of God again

1580
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,820
 if you choose not to worship him

1581
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,280
 and there will be forever good

1582
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,880
 where we know that he's sovereign and good

1583
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,780
 because the rescue has happened.

1584
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,420
 Do you love him?

1585
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,300
 Do you want to know him?

1586
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,560
 Tonight can be your night.

1587
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,820
 You just got to acknowledge that you're part of the problem

1588
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,460
 of evil in this world

1589
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,540
 and that you need rescue and atonement and provision

1590
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,220
 and you're gonna find it in the person of his son,

1591
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:19,580
 Jesus Christ, who was there in the beginning

1592
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,180
 with God and was God.

1593
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,760
 And because he loved you,

1594
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,620
 entered into the sin and death of this world

1595
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:27,380
 and he provided what only God can provide

1596
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,280
 which is a perfect and complete sacrifice

1597
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,860
 which appeased his perfect nature

1598
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,200
 so that he might be just in judging sin

1599
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,340
 and the justifier of those who love him.

1600
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,140
 And so you can have a logical construct.

1601
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,220
 Don't be surprised by the evil among you.

1602
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:45,920
 It's exactly what you think you would get

1603
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,820
 in a world that's run away from God,

1604
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:52,760
 run with God and declare hope to others.

1605
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,300
 Father, thank you for this night with these porch friends

1606
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,180
 and I pray that they would be the rest of their life

1607
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:02,100
 learning more about you and your character and your nature

1608
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,640
 and I pray that you would rescue them

1609
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,980
 from lies and sin and death.

1610
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,380
 Thank you, Lord, that we can come in here

1611
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:08,340
 and we can reason together

1612
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,680
 that you're not afraid of our questions

1613
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,620
 but you want us to really listen when we ask.

1614
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,100
 And so God, tonight we ask this,

1615
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:15,460
 that you would open the eyes of our heart

1616
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,300
 and let us see you.

1617
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,540
 We ask that you would allow those of us

1618
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:21,620
 who don't know you to know you if you're that good.

1619
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,200
 Would you let us not go to bed tonight?

1620
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,440
 Would you let us not leave this room

1621
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,340
 until we do business with a God who rescues

1622
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,900
 and if we came in this room knowing you,

1623
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,180
 may we love you more.

1624
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:31,020
 May we turn to the person to our left and to our right.

1625
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:31,860
 Are you suffering?

1626
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,140
 This is a beaten down world.

1627
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:34,660
 How can I help you?

1628
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,080
 How can I encourage you?

1629
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,900
 How can I be a friend for you in a friendless world?

1630
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,580
 How can I offer you hope in the midst of your hopelessness?

1631
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:44,640
 I pray that believers in this room, Lord,

1632
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,060
 would love as you love, do as you did,

1633
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,660
 suffer as you suffer until that day

1634
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:50,400
 when they will move to that world

1635
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,660
 where they'll just receive your goodness forever.

1636
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,320
 While we're here on this journey,

1637
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,940
 help us to take on evil with the declaration of good news,

1638
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:03,300
 the doing of good deeds by the power of your spirit

1639
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,420
 because we live in relationship with you,

1640
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:08,380
 not so you'll love us but because we love you.

1641
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:11,300
 For the glory of God, the salvation of others,

1642
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:14,060
 and for joy to our own hearts, I pray.

1643
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:14,900
 Amen.

1644
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:20,820
 God is powerful, but he's not a rapist.

1645
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:25,460
 You know, money can buy you a good dog,

1646
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:28,980
 it just can't buy you the wag of his tail.

1647
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,980
 And what God has done in expressing his goodness to you

1648
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,260
 through the redemption of this world,

1649
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,700
 through the crucifixion of his son,

1650
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:39,020
 is show you his love and he just says, "Come to me."

1651
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:42,020
 But he's not gonna force himself on you.

1652
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,900
 You're free to choose to follow him

1653
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,540
 or you're free to choose to make this your heaven.

1654
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,620
 But one day, mark my word,

1655
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:49,780
 there's gonna be two kinds of people,

1656
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,860
 people that says God to them, "Have as you want.

1657
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,860
 "There'll be nothing that will ever remind you of me again."

1658
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:00,660
 That means nothing but pain, no rest.

1659
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,900
 Death would even be a gift

1660
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,460
 and that's why there won't even be that.

1661
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,100
 Just eternal loss.

1662
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,380
 And then there's people that will come to him now

1663
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,820
 and say, "God, your will be done.

1664
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,460
 "Redeem me from death and sin."

1665
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,420
 And to you he'll say, "Your will be done.

1666
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,460
 "Let me give you all of me.

1667
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,620
 "And there'll be nothing that will ever remind you

1668
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,540
 "of the absence of me again."

1669
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,980
 God's story is he wants you to start

1670
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,420
 to live in that reality right now.

1671
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,060
 That's why there are crazy people like me

1672
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,420
 who sing in the midst of chaos and cancer.

1673
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,940
 'Cause I'm not surprised by it.

1674
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:37,420
 I know why it's here.

1675
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,660
 I do what I can to mitigate it,

1676
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,540
 but my God's sovereign over it.

1677
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,460
 And if this is the end for me, I just move to glory.

1678
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,740
 But while I'm here, I'm gonna be faithful

1679
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:45,780
 and filled with hope.

1680
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:48,380
 (gentle music)

1681
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:58,380
