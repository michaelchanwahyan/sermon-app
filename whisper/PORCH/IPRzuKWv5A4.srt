1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,960
 All right, what is up guys, friends listening in

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,320
 wherever you are tuning in from.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,980
 And of course, I've got some friends here

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,820
 that are gonna be joining us

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,160
 as we continue this series,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,200
 fact check part two, facing the truth about our faith

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
 and putting some of the claims and beliefs

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,600
 that Christians have really held to on the stand

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,840
 and fact checking them.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,640
 So last week we covered how can God be good

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
 and bad things still happen.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,400
 And each week we're covering just some of the claims

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,520
 of how can Jesus be the only way?

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,840
 How can a loving God send people to hell?

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,240
 And tonight we are launching into

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,600
 another one of those topics.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,020
 But let me give a quick story

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,600
 that'll give us some direction for where we're going.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
 I've got a philosophy.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
 When I, when we've owned a couple of homes

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,280
 that we've lived in and then we moved on to another one

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 and sold that one and moved to another house.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,780
 And each time we bought a house,

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,040
 I've embraced a little philosophy.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,040
 So this is just for free for anybody out there.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,160
 And here's the way that I think about when we buy a house.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,880
 We look for the home that everybody else

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,160
 is gonna be afraid of wanting

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,760
 because of something wrong with it.

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,920
 Well, in other words, if there's a home

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,500
 that has criteria or things about it

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,400
 that it's like, oh, there's mold in there

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,680
 or there's foundation problems,

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,120
 whatever characteristics are gonna make everybody else

36
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,100
 be like, honey, we are moving on.

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,120
 That is not the house.

38
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,600
 That is the one that we want or that I want.

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,680
 And my loving wife goes along with or tolerates.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,600
 That's why marrying well is important, fellas.

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
 But point being, when it comes to houses,

42
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
 that's just been kind of the offense that we've run.

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,600
 It's high risk, but it also comes with high reward.

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,960
 And it allows you to get usually a deal

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
 because most people are scared away

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,640
 from getting that type of house.

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,840
 So there was a chance a couple of years ago

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,600
 where there was a house that came on the market

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
 and it was, actually it was off market,

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,920
 but some friends had told us about it being available

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
 and we found out more about the property

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
 and it was what's called a distressed property.

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,760
 So there was like some issues with it.

54
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,520
 So we went and saw it and we had known

55
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,400
 that there was foundation issues,

56
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,060
 which is a big deal as it comes to a house.

57
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,320
 And we knew there were foundation issues,

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,640
 but they had fixed them.

59
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,680
 But because the foundation issues were so significant,

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,640
 although they had recently fixed the foundation,

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,660
 they hadn't fixed all of the problems with the house

62
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,740
 that had come from its foundation being off.

63
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,600
 So literally every single door in this house was jacked up.

64
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
 It was all on an angle.

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
 Some doors you couldn't even open

66
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,120
 because the foundation had shifted

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
 and it moved things around in the house

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
 and it didn't allow you to open all the doors.

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 Windows were jacked up, there are cracks in the ceiling,

70
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,640
 all types of problems.

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,580
 The upstairs bathroom didn't work

72
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,040
 because the plumbing had gotten jacked up

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,060
 with all the foundation stuff.

74
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,440
 So we go see this house

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
 and this is like a dream come true for me.

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,520
 'Cause I'm like, dude, this is gonna scare everybody away.

77
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,480
 This is a house that we should seriously consider.

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
 But there was foundation problems.

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,280
 And before, I made like a good deal,

80
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,000
 but I'm not gonna move my entire family into a house

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,680
 that if the foundation is not fixed,

82
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,360
 it's gonna continue no matter if we fix all the doors,

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,860
 it's gonna continue to be a big problem for our family.

84
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,040
 So I began to go like, hey, how can I put it to the test

85
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,040
 to make sure that the foundation that is here

86
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,580
 has been fixed, it is trustworthy,

87
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,400
 this isn't gonna continue going forward.

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,600
 We're not gonna, in six months after replacing the doors,

89
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,240
 be like, the doors still don't open again

90
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,500
 or don't open again.

91
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,600
 How can I make sure that happens?

92
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,080
 So we began to like invest stuff

93
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,240
 I wouldn't normally do to a house that I didn't own

94
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
 where we were like, it's worth it though.

95
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,200
 Before we move our life into here,

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,860
 we need to test this and pay engineers and pay architects

97
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,400
 and have someone come out

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,900
 to make sure this foundation is fixed, it is solid,

99
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,280
 it is trustworthy and you can live your life

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,520
 and rebuild this house on top of it.

101
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
 And what does that have to do with tonight

102
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,680
 what we're talking about?

103
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
 So tonight we're continuing and we are looking at

104
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,160
 one of the most key objections

105
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
 I think that a lot of people have,

106
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,440
 which is how can I know the Bible is the words of God?

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,680
 Or how can I trust the Bible?

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,240
 Hasn't been changed over time, is it really reliable?

109
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,660
 In other words, is it a foundation

110
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,320
 that I can build my life on?

111
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,440
 'Cause that's, Jesus even said his teachings

112
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
 were like a foundation that you should build your life on.

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
 And when we think about our faith,

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
 the Bible is a foundation that is at the epicenter

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,760
 and beneath all the Christian teachings.

116
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,980
 Like if we can't trust the Bible,

117
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,940
 then our foundation is totally done.

118
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,940
 And yet if we, for many of us,

119
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,500
 we build our life on these teachings

120
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,040
 and along the journey, maybe you were a Christian

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
 and you began to build your life on the teachings

122
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,160
 of the Bible and the teaching of Jesus.

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,680
 And then at some point in life, somebody came along

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,020
 and they were like, hey, you know,

125
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,980
 the Bible has been changed or there's contradictions in it

126
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,080
 or there's problems with it, or it's really outdated.

127
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,960
 You can't build your life on that thing.

128
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,340
 And all of a sudden it's like our foundation got knocked

129
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,440
 and our faith just shakes.

130
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,760
 And does it have to be that way?

131
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,860
 And I believe the answer is no.

132
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,200
 And so tonight, I just wanna talk about

133
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,600
 some of the key objections as it relates

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
 to the foundation of God's word and examine together,

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,420
 putting it to the test over whether or not it is trustworthy,

136
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,380
 can we build our life on top of it?

137
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,200
 And is it worth living according to?

138
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,220
 'Cause think about it for a second.

139
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,160
 If it's true, I think a lot of us entertain the idea

140
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,600
 that maybe it's not true.

141
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,800
 But I want you for a second to entertain the idea,

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
 what if it's true?

143
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,000
 What if every single part of it is accurate?

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,400
 It's true, it's true, it happened.

145
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,940
 It changes everything.

146
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,280
 And if it is true, then we shouldn't be afraid

147
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
 of examining and putting it to the test

148
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,260
 and asking the hard questions.

149
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,680
 Because if you're anything like me,

150
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,600
 you went to school or college or had people in your family

151
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,700
 that came along at some point and said,

152
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,200
 "Hey, I'm not sure you can really trust that.

153
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,120
 "And tonight I just wanna put to the test

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
 "the foundation of God's word.

155
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,520
 "Is it something that we can build our life on?"

156
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,680
 So I'm gonna answer three questions.

157
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,340
 Number one, what is in the Bible?

158
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,760
 Just a high level in case you've never heard it,

159
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,920
 or maybe you got this message past you from a friend

160
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,080
 and you don't have kind of a great understanding

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
 of even what the Bible is.

162
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,320
 And I'm sure you're a quick learner

163
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 'cause you're listening in tonight.

164
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,600
 So I'm just gonna high level explain

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
 what even the Bible is, what it contains.

166
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,520
 Then go into, can I trust the Bible?

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,360
 Can I trust it?

168
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
 Has it been changed?

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
 Does it contradict itself?

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 If so, how and where?

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,580
 And then what should I do with it?

172
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,840
 So let me start with what is in the Bible?

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,560
 Is it just a religious book and just like,

174
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,920
 any of the different religious books out there?

175
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,440
 No, you would expect me to say that,

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
 but here's why I would say that.

177
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,680
 First off, let me explain inside of the Bible,

178
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
 the word Bible is kind of comes from a Latin word.

179
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,360
 It just means La Biblia, it's like the books.

180
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
 And a better way of understanding

181
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,680
 or thinking about the Bible is it's not just one book.

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,360
 It's like this library of books.

183
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
 It's a bunch of different books that are in there.

184
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
 And if you were to compare it to the way

185
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,360
 that our books currently we read,

186
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,720
 there's like a chapter when you read

187
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
 just kind of modern books today,

188
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,640
 almost each of the different books in the Bible

189
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,520
 are like a different chapter.

190
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,160
 So Genesis is a chapter and then Exodus is a chapter.

191
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,480
 And inside of the Bible,

192
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,040
 there's 66 of those books or chapters.

193
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
 And they break up into two parts.

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,480
 You got part one, we call it the Old Testament.

195
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,180
 Part two, New Testament.

196
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,320
 Inside of the Old Testament, what's that about?

197
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
 Old Testament is about the people of God,

198
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,960
 nation of Israel and God's relationship with them

199
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,780
 and his plan and his working through that nation.

200
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,320
 And then the New Testament is really the story of Jesus

201
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
 and everything after.

202
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,080
 Everything in the Old Testament, it's all before Jesus.

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
 Everything in the New Testament,

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
 that's Jesus and everything after.

205
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
 And one of the reasons why you're thinking,

206
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,460
 hey, when I read the Bible, it's kind of hard to follow.

207
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,780
 Like I don't exactly understand what's going on.

208
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,400
 It doesn't read like a Harry Potter novel

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
 where I can just, I can seamlessly follow.

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
 And yet people say it's this one storyline

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
 that God has written from beginning to end.

212
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,480
 Why is it hard to sometimes follow?

213
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,220
 And here's the answer why.

214
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,040
 It doesn't take place in chronological order.

215
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,920
 If you've ever opened it

216
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,080
 and you can actually buy a Bible

217
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,280
 that goes in chronological order,

218
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
 but the typical Bible that people read,

219
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,460
 the average American has one, nine out of 10.

220
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,560
 The typical Bible that is there

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,440
 is grouped up into different genres.

222
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
 And some of those genres,

223
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,520
 so in other words, if you were to open up,

224
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,320
 it's not grouped in order of sequence.

225
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,640
 It's like it's grouped based on the type of literature.

226
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
 You guys remember like types of literature,

227
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,260
 like you got poetry and you got fiction and nonfiction.

228
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,240
 In the Bible, they group it up

229
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,200
 into these different categories.

230
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
 So the first five books are called the law.

231
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,000
 That was like Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus

232
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,100
 and Deuteronomy and Numbers, that's the law.

233
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,440
 And then you have the historical books.

234
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,240
 All this is in part one, the Old Testament.

235
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,880
 So you've got the law, then you've got historical books.

236
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,640
 Then you've got like poetic stuff.

237
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
 This is Job and the Psalms,

238
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,200
 which is like the Spotify playlist for the nation of Israel

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,880
 kind of as poetic and there's repetition and imagery

240
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,160
 and it's really beautiful stuff.

241
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,100
 And then you have the prophecy books,

242
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,200
 which are those guys in the Old Testament

243
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,680
 that are always saying, "Let's say it the Lord,"

244
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
 and they seem just a little bit upset.

245
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,560
 That's the prophetic books.

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,320
 You got major ones and minor ones, but the prophecy books.

247
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,520
 And then you have the gospels.

248
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,760
 That's when you get into the New Testament.

249
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
 So all of that was in the Old Testament.

250
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,920
 Then you get to the New Testament

251
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
 and it's still grouped by category.

252
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
 And you've got these four gospels,

253
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,840
 which are just four accounts of the life of Jesus.

254
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,120
 And then you have the letters or the epistles,

255
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,960
 some people call them,

256
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,560
 but it's basically the letters of the guys

257
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
 who knew Jesus and walked with him.

258
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,640
 And then you have the prophetic book or kind of end times,

259
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,520
 which is the book of Revelation,

260
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,480
 but it's grouped up into that.

261
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,360
 And so if you've ever found yourself wondering like,

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,320
 "Man, why is this kind of hard to follow?"

263
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
 It's 'cause it's grouped in by genre

264
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,880
 and yet it has one storyline written throughout it.

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,620
 It's pretty remarkable, honestly.

266
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,360
 There's 40 different authors that have written

267
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,400
 over 2000 years, the storyline.

268
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,680
 And the storyline is simply this,

269
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
 it's how God's from the very beginning of time,

270
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
 his plan of redemption,

271
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
 his plan to save the human race through Jesus.

272
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,320
 That's from beginning to end.

273
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,140
 And you may be going,

274
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,640
 "Well, then why is it sometimes hard to follow in there?"

275
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,560
 It's like this, you guys ever seen the show, "This Is Us"?

276
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,720
 Anybody? Yeah?

277
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,120
 Okay, so you know in "This Is Us",

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
 there's these moments of flashback

279
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,200
 where Kate will have this flashback

280
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
 to an earlier time in her life,

281
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,040
 or even there's fast forwards where Rebecca has something

282
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,840
 and they're back to modern day

283
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,120
 and then they flashback to an earlier time.

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,420
 And it can be, unless you know the storyline,

285
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,120
 it can be kind of hard to follow.

286
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,680
 In other words, when somebody joins you for the first time

287
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,600
 and they've never seen any of it,

288
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,740
 and then they're tuning in, they're like,

289
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,600
 "Wait a second, why is she old in this shot?

290
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,060
 "And why is she young in that one?"

291
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,120
 Because there's this bigger picture storyline

292
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,220
 that's going on.

293
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,800
 And unless you see the full picture,

294
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,640
 it's hard to exactly go there.

295
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,480
 That's essentially what the Bible is.

296
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,320
 But it's possible to see the full picture,

297
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
 but if you just pick it up and you open up to one chapter,

298
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,840
 you're not gonna understand the storyline.

299
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,160
 It's like a version of "This Is Us."

300
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,040
 But the story that God has been writing

301
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,640
 from the beginning of time is his rescue plan.

302
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,000
 And you can go to very early in Genesis

303
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,440
 and you see Jesus told about in Genesis chapter three,

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,040
 where God said, "There's gonna come a day

305
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
 "I'm gonna get rid of everything evil

306
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,260
 "and broken in this world.

307
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,320
 "And I'm gonna send someone who will crush all of the sin,

308
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,800
 "all of the pain, all of the brokenness.

309
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,920
 "And he's gonna die for humanity's sin."

310
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,600
 And all throughout the Bible, that storyline is there.

311
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,320
 But that's big picture, what God is writing.

312
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,440
 And that's the storyline of the Bible.

313
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,680
 So that's what's in it.

314
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,280
 Okay, so now the bigger question is, can I trust the Bible?

315
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,820
 Like, can I trust what it says?

316
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,760
 How do I know that it hasn't been changed?

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,240
 How do I know that it wasn't just made up

318
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,300
 by some guys hundreds of years later,

319
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,960
 or this myth that was put forward?

320
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,520
 Like, how can I trust?

321
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,000
 'Cause let's be honest,

322
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,080
 that's a really big and important question.

323
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,320
 Me being told I should trust it

324
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,560
 is very different from me being shown

325
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
 and compelled why it is trustworthy.

326
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,560
 So I wanna attempt to answer two questions.

327
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,840
 The first being, is it possible that these are just myths

328
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,280
 that were made up years and years later?

329
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,440
 No, here's why I say that.

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,280
 There's a couple of reasons.

331
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,840
 The first one being this, and just listen to me

332
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
 in case you're tuning me out and you're like,

333
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,680
 "Oh man, no, my professor said this."

334
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,800
 Or some guy on YouTube who's like,

335
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,740
 "The Bible stinks, '09," gave you some comment

336
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,760
 that threw your faith off, tune back in

337
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,760
 because you may have abandoned it too soon.

338
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,320
 The reason why I say it couldn't have been a myth

339
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,520
 developed hundreds of years later,

340
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,780
 like the Da Vinci Code says,

341
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,640
 is because we have copies and we have versions

342
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,280
 of the New Testament and of gospel writings,

343
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,760
 of the book of John specifically,

344
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,680
 that date all the way back to between 90 and 110 AD,

345
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,040
 which is right around the time of the life of John.

346
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,840
 In other words, we have the story in the gospel

347
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,960
 very, very early on and very immediately after

348
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,320
 Jesus and the disciples and all of that timeline

349
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,260
 was taking place.

350
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,320
 The idea that hundreds of years later,

351
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,500
 people came in and they showed up

352
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,780
 and they just made this story up

353
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,080
 'cause they just all wanted power and that's what they did,

354
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
 that is not possible.

355
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,120
 Is it possible that maybe the disciples,

356
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
 now here's a more interesting question.

357
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,760
 Is it possible that the disciples,

358
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,280
 I'm talking Peter, John, James, Andrew,

359
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,480
 they got together and they decided,

360
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,040
 "We're gonna make up a myth,

361
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,160
 "it's gonna turn the world upside down.

362
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,780
 "Gonna make up, we gotta have a hero,

363
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,880
 "let's call him Jesus.

364
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
 "No, I like Jesus better, let's go with that one."

365
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
 And they just begin to put this plot together

366
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
 and they're like, "Let's get our story straight.

367
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,820
 "It's gonna turn the world upside down

368
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,560
 "and we're gonna end up all dying for it,

369
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,820
 "but everyone needs to be cool with it

370
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,000
 "'cause someday people will name their children after us

371
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
 "and they're gonna be like,

372
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,260
 "Oh, Peter, for thousands of years.

373
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,440
 "Yeah, let's all get together."

374
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,580
 And they got together and they began to plan out

375
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,640
 how they would make up this myth

376
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,140
 that all of them would die horrifically for.

377
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,680
 And the myth involved a Jewish peasant

378
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,640
 from a place you can't identify on the map,

379
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
 but it was so compelling

380
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,800
 that all of them went to their deaths

381
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,640
 and hundreds of others did as well

382
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
 and it turned the world upside down.

383
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,720
 And today, every atheist, Buddhist, Christian person

384
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,960
 on the planet dates their calendar

385
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,080
 by the date of this man that they made up.

386
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,000
 It's a pretty genius plan for some fishermen

387
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
 who could barely read and write.

388
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,600
 And so is it possible?

389
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,860
 Anything is possible.

390
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,340
 Is it logical or likely?

391
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,060
 No, what I mean by anything's possible,

392
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,460
 like when it comes to history, you just,

393
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,820
 you gotta know this.

394
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,780
 You cannot prove anything historically.

395
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,180
 And you may be going, "Yeah, you can."

396
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,020
 No, you can't.

397
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,300
 You can look at the evidence and based on the evidence,

398
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,500
 judge, what's a reasonable explanation for that?

399
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,460
 Like, for example, I would guess most of you

400
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,860
 believe in George Washington, right?

401
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
 Anybody not believe in George Washington?

402
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
 Why do you believe in George Washington?

403
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,760
 Because history books,

404
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,980
 because somebody told you about it

405
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,060
 and you read about it and you believed in there.

406
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,260
 Have you ever met George Washington?

407
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,260
 Do you know anybody who has ever met George Washington?

408
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,980
 You believe in George Washington by faith.

409
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,380
 And you know what's possible?

410
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,300
 It's a hoax.

411
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,020
 There was never George Washington.

412
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,980
 There was never any founding fathers that are here.

413
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,540
 We're not even really real.

414
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,780
 We're all in the matrix

415
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
 and everything I'm doing right now is not real.

416
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,100
 Is that possible?

417
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,520
 Anything is possible.

418
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,300
 Is it likely?

419
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,120
 Is it probable?

420
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,940
 Is it reasonable enough to live your life according to?

421
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,260
 No, and as unreasonable as it is to reject

422
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,420
 the idea of George Washington,

423
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,060
 it is unreasonable to look at these fishermen disciples

424
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,660
 and think, I bet they came up with a myth

425
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,580
 that would turn the world upside down.

426
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,780
 And it wasn't because they would get any financial gain.

427
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,840
 Nope, they lost everything, including their own lives.

428
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,440
 And they did all of it and went to their death saying,

429
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,100
 this is not about some movement I'm starting.

430
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
 All of them died for the same reason.

431
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,480
 I saw a man die on a cross

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,140
 and he was buried in the ground.

433
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,280
 And then he came back alive and you can kill me.

434
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,540
 You can do whatever you want.

435
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,920
 But he said, if I trust in him,

436
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,100
 I'm gonna have eternal life.

437
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,760
 And every one of them lost their life for that.

438
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,660
 Could it have been a myth

439
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,220
 that they just got together and made up?

440
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,120
 Sure, it's possible.

441
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,180
 It's not reasonable.

442
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,320
 Okay, so maybe they didn't make that all up.

443
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,220
 Maybe the Bible has just changed over time.

444
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,540
 Like maybe some of the versions and the stories

445
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,920
 and maybe they got kind of added and changed along the way.

446
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,760
 There's two problems.

447
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,960
 One I already mentioned.

448
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,120
 We have manuscripts that go way back

449
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,820
 into the first century, into the times

450
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,080
 and right after the disciples and everyone was there.

451
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,900
 And at the time they were there.

452
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,720
 The second problem is the number of the manuscripts.

453
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,880
 Like we have so many thousands of manuscripts

454
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,080
 and they all, they don't tell like very different stories.

455
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
 Like, oh, there's this version of the Bible

456
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,320
 and then there's this version.

457
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,320
 They all tell the exact same story.

458
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,580
 Here's what I mean.

459
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,620
 When it comes to manuscripts,

460
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,780
 you may have heard some of this stuff in school before.

461
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,660
 You may have heard of this.

462
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,120
 When it comes to the idea of like Caesar, Caesar's lives,

463
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,260
 there's a book called Caesar's Lives.

464
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,140
 How many versions and copies of Caesar's lives

465
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,660
 do you think we have?

466
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,700
 You may have heard of this book.

467
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,540
 We have 10.

468
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,000
 Plato, anybody heard of Plato?

469
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,580
 Not the stuff that you play with, like the guy, Socrates.

470
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,380
 How many versions of Plato do we have from the ancient world?

471
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,940
 Like how many copies?

472
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,260
 Seven.

473
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,020
 Tacitus, the Roman historian.

474
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,440
 He's responsible for the reason

475
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,760
 we know so much about Rome and that history.

476
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,480
 How many do we have of him?

477
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,320
 20.

478
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,080
 If you studied history, you like me learned that,

479
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,280
 hey, Tacitus, this is true.

480
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,760
 You can take it to the bank.

481
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,160
 We have 20 copies of that.

482
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,120
 Homer's Iliad.

483
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,280
 How many of you have Homer's Iliad?

484
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,960
 643, that's not bad.

485
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,920
 It's a lot better than the other ones.

486
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,360
 How many copies do we have of the New Testament?

487
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,600
 You guessed it, Lauren.

488
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,020
 24,633.

489
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,560
 We have an enormous number and all of those,

490
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,840
 to a 99.5% are entirely the same,

491
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,980
 with the exception of a couple of things.

492
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,840
 Some of them have some spelling errors.

493
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,200
 Like one has John with two Ns, one has John with one.

494
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,640
 Where it's like, oh, that's the type of changes

495
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,840
 that make people go, I'm not sure we can trust the Bible.

496
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,700
 Because one guy who was making a copy,

497
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,520
 put an extra N on there.

498
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
 The other ones, this is again, 99% of any of the differences

499
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,680
 between those thousands of manuscripts

500
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,580
 have to do with the order of words.

501
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,840
 One says Christ Jesus, and this one says Jesus Christ.

502
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,520
 Which one was it?

503
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,980
 In other words, the differences don't make any difference

504
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,400
 in terms of actual beliefs.

505
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,920
 Let me give you some of the examples of like,

506
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,240
 'cause there is 0.5 where the actual word is different.

507
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,360
 There's 0.5% where it actually makes a difference

508
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
 in the reading of the sentence.

509
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
 And I remember in grad school, we'd actually study these.

510
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,040
 And you would think like, dude, that's exciting.

511
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,280
 We're about to look at like the text that's like,

512
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,280
 oh man, this says Jesus had a girlfriend named Sarah.

513
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,240
 And this one says he was in a biker gang,

514
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,760
 all these different, maybe these are gonna be

515
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,840
 some really exciting differences in the versions.

516
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,240
 Here's one of the more exciting ones.

517
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,480
 Comes from 1 Thessalonians 2, verse seven.

518
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,760
 We have one copy of it that says,

519
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,120
 "But we were gentle among you,

520
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,920
 "like a nursing mother taking care of her own children."

521
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,540
 We have another copy that they found that says,

522
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,960
 "But we were infants among you,

523
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,120
 "like a nursing mother taking care of her own children."

524
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,200
 Is it gentle or is it infants?

525
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,760
 In Greek, the word has one letter difference,

526
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,840
 napioi or apioi.

527
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
 You decide.

528
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
 I think it's infants.

529
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,040
 The vast majority of manuscripts in all the copies say like,

530
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,360
 it's infants.

531
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,680
 But could it be that it was gentle?

532
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
 Sure.

533
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,800
 But that doesn't make any difference.

534
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,320
 So anybody and any parent or any friend or any uncle

535
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,160
 who comes up and is like,

536
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
 "The Bible has been changed, there's so many differences."

537
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,120
 You can say, "Uncle, one,

538
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,840
 "do you know the differences

539
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,020
 "do not make any difference at all?

540
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,600
 "Two, have you ever studied anything on that subject?"

541
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
 Because by him even phrasing it like that,

542
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,240
 it reflects the fact that he's ignorant.

543
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,800
 It is intellectually lazy

544
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,040
 to say that the Bible has been changed

545
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,400
 to any degree that is untrustworthy.

546
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,560
 There's not a single belief, doctrine, teaching

547
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,160
 of Jesus or in the Bible that changes.

548
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,120
 And even the differences like that,

549
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
 we have thousands that we can see like,

550
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,200
 "Oh yeah, it's probably infants, but it could be gentle,

551
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,480
 "but it doesn't change anything.

552
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,920
 "The Bible is trustworthy."

553
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,680
 Could it have been made up myths by men years later?

554
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,520
 No.

555
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,200
 Could it have been made up on the scene by Peter,

556
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,660
 getting the gang together?

557
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,880
 Maybe.

558
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,840
 Is it reasonable?

559
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,680
 No.

560
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,520
 Has it been changed over time?

561
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
 No.

562
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,000
 The real reason, candidly, while people don't want to accept

563
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,840
 or believe that the Bible,

564
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,180
 and they throw up this smoke screen of like,

565
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,480
 "You know what's been changed over time?

566
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,320
 "You can't trust it."

567
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,880
 And there's so many translations that it's outdated.

568
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,660
 It's not because the Bible contradicts itself.

569
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,500
 It's because the Bible contradicts them.

570
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,560
 It's because they think,

571
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,460
 "If I really accepted this as true,

572
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,180
 "I'm gonna have to change things,

573
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,740
 "or my girlfriend may stop sleeping with me,

574
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,100
 "or I don't like what it says about homosexuality,

575
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,720
 "so I'm gonna hide behind the smoke screen of,

576
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
 "you know, we can't trust that thing in any ways.

577
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,120
 "It's a 2,000-year-old book, and you can't believe that."

578
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,040
 And it's not because the Bible came up in error.

579
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,420
 It's because the Bible contradicted them.

580
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,800
 So what's in the Bible?

581
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,260
 And then we looked at, can I trust the Bible?

582
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,880
 Yes.

583
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,900
 What should I do with the Bible?

584
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,960
 You should read it and apply it.

585
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,900
 Read it and apply it.

586
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,120
 First, that involves understanding how to study it.

587
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
 It means you pick up God's Word,

588
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,720
 or you pick up the Bible, and you begin to read it,

589
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,440
 and you begin to go, "What is the eternal truth

590
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,600
 "in the verses and the passage that I'm reading?"

591
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,720
 Don't read it like an eight ball.

592
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,140
 And candidly, this is how I see a lot of Christians

593
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,640
 read the Bible, is they take it,

594
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,080
 and they're like, "I'm gonna shake this thing,

595
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,740
 "and should I move to Houston to take this job?"

596
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,860
 And then they open it up, and they're like,

597
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,200
 "Oh, man, this says, 'Hoshefeth moved to Baal.'"

598
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,040
 Oh, I think maybe that means Houston.

599
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,720
 That's not a good way to read the Bible,

600
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,840
 or people will think, "Am I supposed to marry Sarah?"

601
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,060
 And then they flip open, and they're like,

602
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,300
 "Look, and there, look at this verse.

603
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,560
 "It says Sarah, Sarah, she's in the Bible."

604
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,400
 And it's like, "Yeah, she's in the Bible.

605
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,580
 "That doesn't mean you should marry Sarah."

606
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,800
 And this is how people will think about it,

607
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,920
 and that's a bad way to read it.

608
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,400
 You should pick a starting point, pick a gospel,

609
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,440
 and begin to read it, and begin to ask the question,

610
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,160
 "Hey, what is the eternal truth,

611
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,400
 "or what was the truth then?

612
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,240
 "What was he saying then?

613
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,540
 "What's the truth always, and what is the truth now?

614
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,620
 "How does this apply to my life?"

615
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,100
 Begin to look through and see

616
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,940
 what are the principles that apply.

617
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,420
 The second thing that is involved in, as you're reading it,

618
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,140
 is you begin to read it through the lens

619
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,300
 of the New Testament and the work of Jesus on the cross.

620
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,540
 In other words, when it relates to the Old Testament,

621
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,420
 how should we read it?

622
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,340
 We read it in light of the New Testament

623
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,500
 and the work that Jesus did on the cross.

624
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,340
 In other words, when I come across verses

625
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,000
 in the Old Testament that are like,

626
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,560
 "And then if you do this sin,

627
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,420
 "you need to get three turtle doves and a goat,

628
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,140
 "and you need to kill 'em all."

629
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,740
 No, you don't, unless you want Peter coming to your house.

630
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,460
 Those, through the lens of the New Testament,

631
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,380
 were all finished by Jesus on the cross.

632
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,640
 The sacrifice was made by him.

633
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,300
 So I read everything that I go through

634
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,140
 through the lens of the New Testament.

635
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,980
 Also, as I go through it,

636
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,700
 you need to know that there's a lot of things in the Bible

637
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,500
 that it's not condoning or encouraging,

638
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,980
 it's just describing.

639
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,560
 In other words, there's a difference when it says,

640
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,160
 "Hey, this is what you should do,

641
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,760
 "and this is what they did."

642
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,840
 Does that make sense?

643
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,060
 Like there's times in the Bible

644
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,540
 where it's not telling you you should do this,

645
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,160
 it's just telling you what happened.

646
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,020
 Like Solomon had a thousand wives.

647
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,320
 It's not saying, "Hey, this is goals, guys.

648
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,860
 "You need a thousand wives."

649
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,140
 It's just describing what happened.

650
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,060
 God wasn't for that.

651
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,480
 And we learn in the New Testament,

652
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,100
 when we read through the lens of the New Testament,

653
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,400
 we're like, "Oh."

654
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,220
 When Paul talks about what marriage should look like

655
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,740
 in Ephesians chapter five,

656
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,500
 husbands should love their one wife

657
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,220
 and lay down their life and sacrifice.

658
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,560
 Huh, Solomon didn't get this thing right.

659
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,000
 And that's the way that we see that.

660
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,840
 We don't see it as like,

661
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,020
 "Oh, this is kind of how I should see

662
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,140
 "the way that I should live my life."

663
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,560
 Because there's a difference between what happened

664
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,020
 or what you should do, the Bible laying out,

665
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,020
 "Here's what you should do,

666
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,660
 "and here's what they did in that moment."

667
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,620
 So other tips, here's what would be good to know.

668
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,340
 So what translation should I read?

669
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,180
 'Cause you may hear this,

670
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,100
 like there's so many translations,

671
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,080
 which one should I read?

672
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,460
 We just did a Views from the Porch,

673
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,500
 which is our podcast.

674
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,260
 You can find on iTunes or Spotify

675
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,740
 and go check out the latest episode

676
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,340
 or one or two ago on Bible translations.

677
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,980
 What translation should you read?

678
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,880
 Whichever one you're going to read.

679
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,320
 In other words, is NLT and NIV and ESV, you pick one.

680
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,860
 If you like New King James

681
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,460
 or you like King James and Shakespearean English,

682
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,300
 you do you.

683
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,180
 But whichever one you're going to pick up and read,

684
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,300
 and if you want more information

685
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,340
 on even why they're different translations,

686
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,860
 go check out that episode of Views from the Porch.

687
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,560
 But pick up that, start in a gospel.

688
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,620
 Matthew, especially if you're new to Bible reading,

689
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,540
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,

690
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,980
 those are first century accounts of the life of Jesus.

691
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,000
 And they were written by men who just said,

692
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,500
 "I just saw this guy die, get buried,

693
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,940
 "he came back alive, and I have to record his account

694
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,080
 "because it's true and the world needs to know

695
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,360
 "and begin to read."

696
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,540
 There's resources that we may put out

697
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,700
 either on our blog or online

698
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,160
 that are other places you could start.

699
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,340
 There's something called Join the Journey

700
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,900
 where you can join lots of us here.

701
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,060
 It's a Bible reading plan

702
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,980
 that gets emailed to you every single day,

703
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,900
 and it has a devotional and scripture.

704
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,500
 Go to jointhejourney.com, you can go there.

705
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,900
 To find out more about just the Bible as a whole,

706
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,060
 type in Bible Project on YouTube.

707
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,820
 We have some friends that run something called Bible Project.

708
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,540
 It's excellent, it's phenomenal,

709
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,580
 and you can find out more about Old Testament books.

710
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,620
 And you could just type in a book of the Old Testament

711
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,160
 and it'll give you a high-level explanation of,

712
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,080
 "Oh, this is exactly what is going on there."

713
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,640
 But the point being, begin to read it.

714
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,060
 Do it with other believers in your life.

715
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,520
 This is why we encourage small groups around here,

716
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,600
 or we call them community groups,

717
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,840
 for you to have other people in your life

718
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,480
 so you can read a passage and go,

719
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,840
 "Man, I have no idea what he's talking about right there.

720
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,180
 "Like, why did God tell them to do that?

721
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,240
 "Or what is Paul saying there?"

722
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,760
 And you would have other people in your life

723
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,460
 who could come alongside of you and be like,

724
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,400
 "Oh man, here, let's answer

725
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,060
 "and ask those questions together,

726
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,360
 "and let's find answers together."

727
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,840
 Get a good study Bible.

728
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,440
 Study Bible is just something that has different ways

729
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,780
 or explanations and background and context in the verses,

730
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,760
 or right underneath it,

731
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,560
 so you can know more of what is going on.

732
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,360
 But point being, begin to read and apply it.

733
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,880
 And what you will discover,

734
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,720
 if you will do that consistently,

735
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,800
 your life will change, and it will change for the better.

736
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,240
 And you can put it to the test,

737
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,140
 and you're gonna experience that it is a foundation

738
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,660
 you can build your life on.

739
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,260
 And if you will begin to read it and apply it,

740
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,700
 I promise you, your life is going to change,

741
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,340
 and change in every way that you want it to change.

742
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,940
 There was a study done in 2009.

743
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,080
 It's actually been continued since then.

744
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,540
 But it was a study that basically was done

745
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,340
 over like 40,000 different Christians in America,

746
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,620
 ages eight to 80.

747
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,780
 They took everybody, and they were like,

748
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,220
 "Hey, we're gonna have you all give us some information

749
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,320
 "and the kind of questions that they asked them

750
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,380
 "on the survey ranged from how often you look at pornography

751
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,280
 "to how often you read your Bible

752
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,380
 "to how often was the last time you were drunk,

753
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,460
 "and just kind of like some somewhat personal questions."

754
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,180
 And these people filled it out, and they sent it in.

755
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,200
 And they discovered something really fascinating.

756
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,280
 Again, all these people were Christians.

757
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,880
 They discovered that as it related to reading your Bible,

758
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,640
 there's like a tipping point in life.

759
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,220
 In other words, if you read it one day a week,

760
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,720
 there wasn't much change that they saw in their life.

761
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,380
 And the likelihood of just kind of like reoccurring sin

762
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,660
 taking place in their life, of getting drunk

763
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,560
 and still looking at porn and sleeping with their girlfriend

764
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,620
 or sleeping with somebody outside of marriage,

765
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,980
 all of it remained kind of the same.

766
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,340
 And if you went to two days a week,

767
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,500
 it remained kind of the same as well.

768
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,120
 You were statistically just as likely

769
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,580
 as everyone outside of the church.

770
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,480
 If you went to three days a week, same thing.

771
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,280
 And then they discovered there was a tipping point.

772
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,180
 And that tipping point was four days or more.

773
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,660
 And they said everyone who reads it four days or more

774
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,220
 was 57% less likely to get drunk,

775
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,340
 61% less likely to use pornography,

776
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,740
 70% less likely to engage in sex outside of marriage.

777
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,180
 They were 228% more likely to share their faith with people.

778
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,700
 They were 230% more likely to disciple other people.

779
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,340
 They were 400% more likely to memorize scripture.

780
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,180
 What does all that say?

781
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,740
 It says that those who read their Bible consistently

782
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,740
 four days or more, they experienced life change.

783
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,020
 They were transformed.

784
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,420
 If you don't believe me, for the rest of corona,

785
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,420
 begin to read your Bible every single day.

786
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,980
 Pick up one of the gospels, begin to go through it

787
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,780
 and begin to study and see

788
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,460
 if your life doesn't begin to change

789
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,980
 because here's how it changes.

790
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,460
 We're about to land the plane.

791
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,740
 When you begin to read the Bible and read it consistently

792
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,980
 and not sporadically and kind of once every now and then,

793
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,980
 you begin to be introduced to the hero of the Bible, Jesus.

794
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,940
 You begin to see him on like every page.

795
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,780
 Like a lot of people think,

796
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,500
 oh, the reason why your life would change

797
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,900
 is because like the Bible is this rule book.

798
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,380
 And if you read the rule book every day,

799
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,740
 you probably know the rules.

800
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,860
 So you'll do what the rule book says.

801
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,260
 No, you read the rule book every day

802
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,220
 and you discover the Bible is not a rule book at all.

803
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
 It's a book about how you and I

804
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,320
 can have a relationship with God.

805
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,980
 And how from the very beginning of time,

806
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,700
 he's been on a rescue mission

807
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,820
 to save every single person out there

808
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,700
 from the pain of sin and death in our world.

809
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,380
 And inside, when you begin to read,

810
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,780
 you're introduced to the person of Jesus.

811
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,620
 And you know what the Bible says happens

812
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,460
 whenever that takes place?

813
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,180
 The Bible says, you begin to transform.

814
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,540
 2 Corinthians chapter three says, you begin to change.

815
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,300
 The more you see Jesus, your life begins to change

816
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
 from one degree to the next, to the next.

817
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,700
 And any person who reads the scripture

818
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,000
 and consistently reads it, their life doesn't change

819
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,220
 'cause they know all the rules.

820
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,220
 Their life changed because they see Jesus in it.

821
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,480
 From beginning to end.

822
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,860
 Can you trust the Bible?

823
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,980
 Yes.

824
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,880
 And if you do, and if you apply it,

825
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,060
 you're gonna experience a life

826
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,660
 like you could hardly even imagine.

827
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,780
 And you could build your life

828
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,380
 on the foundation of his word.

829
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,940
 And when you do, your life is gonna transform

830
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,160
 and you're gonna see Jesus on every page.

831
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,900
 Let me close with this just to emphasize that point.

832
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,300
 In Luke chapter 24, we're told of a story

833
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,100
 that takes place right after Jesus rose from the grave.

834
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,860
 In other words, right after he was crucified,

835
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,220
 towards the end of the book of Luke, the gospel of Luke,

836
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,740
 we're introduced to an interaction that Jesus has.

837
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,660
 He rises from the grave, he comes back to life,

838
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,260
 and he hasn't totally shown everybody himself yet.

839
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,500
 He hasn't totally introduced to all of the disciples.

840
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 He's alive.

841
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,340
 Hey, this is real.

842
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,120
 And we're told that there were two of his disciples

843
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,300
 who were walking on the road.

844
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,220
 It's called the road to Emmaus.

845
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,100
 They were just walking from one town to the next.

846
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,460
 And Jesus sees them,

847
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,620
 and he begins to walk up to these two guys,

848
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,200
 and it's like a seven mile walk, we're told.

849
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,060
 And he joins the conversation.

850
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,220
 But we're told for whatever reason,

851
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,340
 they couldn't see Jesus.

852
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,700
 They didn't recognize him.

853
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,120
 They didn't know exactly who he was.

854
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,980
 For whatever reason, he kind of like disguised himself

855
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,940
 and Jesus shows up and he's like, hey, what's up guys?

856
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,900
 And they were like, oh, you know,

857
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,060
 we're just grieving the fact that the Messiah

858
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,220
 we thought was the king just died.

859
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,780
 And he begins to enter in this conversation.

860
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,420
 He's like, what are you talking about?

861
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,560
 And they say, are you the only person?

862
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,420
 We just read the verse.

863
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,620
 Are you the only person?

864
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,420
 The only one visiting Jerusalem who doesn't know

865
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,060
 about the things that have happened here in these days?

866
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,900
 And he says, what things?

867
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,820
 In other words, they're like, hey,

868
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,180
 are you the only person that hasn't read

869
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,220
 the Jerusalem Times?

870
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,060
 There's a coronavirus going on, bro.

871
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,940
 There was a guy we thought was king and he died.

872
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,160
 We thought he was gonna save the world

873
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,860
 and save the nation of Israel, which is what they said.

874
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,200
 He was sentenced to death and they crucified him.

875
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,420
 We hoped he had been the one that was gonna redeem Israel.

876
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,860
 What more, it's the third day and all of this took place.

877
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,220
 In addition, some of the women, they amazed us

878
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,100
 because they went to the tomb of Jesus this morning,

879
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,300
 but they didn't find his body.

880
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,860
 They're telling Jesus this entire thing.

881
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,740
 And he's just like sitting there

882
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,660
 and listening to the entire thing.

883
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,220
 I love it.

884
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,700
 They came and told us they'd seen angels

885
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,760
 and that Jesus was alive.

886
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,980
 And some of our companions went

887
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,340
 and they found the tomb empty just as they had seen.

888
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,680
 And then Jesus jumps in and says something

889
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,300
 that is so remarkable.

890
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,000
 Think about this conversation.

891
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,380
 Oh, foolish ones, how slow to believe you are

892
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,240
 that all the prophets have spoken.

893
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,140
 Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things

894
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,580
 and then enter into glory?

895
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,660
 Wasn't what happened to Jesus, him dying, him rising,

896
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,260
 all of that told in the Old Testament

897
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,100
 and the writings and the prophets.

898
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,600
 And then beginning with Moses and all of the prophets,

899
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,880
 he explained to them

900
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,280
 what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself.

901
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,880
 Think about that conversation for a second.

902
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,920
 Jesus begins to go,

903
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,540
 all of the Old Testament, all of the Bible,

904
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,360
 everything you've ever read was all pointing to me.

905
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,200
 In other words, people have a tendency to look at the Bible

906
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,060
 and they're like, oh, it's a rule book,

907
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,940
 I need to follow the rules

908
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,340
 and I need to do whatever it says.

909
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,260
 You know what that puts at the epicenter?

910
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,780
 You, you're not at the center of the story of the Bible

911
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,680
 and neither am I.

912
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,060
 And Jesus says the entire thing,

913
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,220
 it's all been pointing to me.

914
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,340
 Chapter or part one, Old Testament, all of it about Jesus.

915
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,140
 Part two, all of it about Jesus,

916
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,220
 it's all been pointing to him.

917
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,740
 And I just want, think about what that must've been like

918
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,020
 when he sat there and he walked through,

919
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,780
 how all of it was pointing to him.

920
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,060
 How Adam, remember how Adam in the garden,

921
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,060
 he was tempted and he failed.

922
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,680
 Jesus also in the garden was tempted,

923
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,300
 but he passed his test and he went to the cross.

924
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,420
 How we're told about Noah, how God comes to Noah

925
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,100
 and he says, look, hey, I'm gonna allow you

926
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,620
 to build and take a piece of wood

927
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,380
 and any person who trusts in that piece of wood lifted up

928
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,300
 will be saved from destruction.

929
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,760
 So Jesus, through a piece of wood

930
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,900
 and him being lifted up on a cross

931
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,740
 and all who trust in that piece are saved from destruction.

932
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,140
 And he just walks through.

933
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,460
 Yeah, I could just see him on the road.

934
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,300
 He's walking with this guy, he goes,

935
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,860
 "Think about Abraham, Abraham in a moment where God came

936
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,060
 and he said, hey, I want you to take your son,

937
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,020
 your one and only son."

938
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,220
 It's in the verse.

939
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,580
 I want you to take him and sacrifice him.

940
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,020
 And he takes him to a mountain called Golgotha

941
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,380
 or Mount Moriah, it's where Golgotha is.

942
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,180
 And miraculously at the last moment,

943
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,980
 there's a ram that appears and God provides a sacrifice.

944
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,740
 Don't kill your son.

945
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,780
 How is it all not pointing to Jesus

946
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,740
 and God who would as a father sacrifice

947
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,900
 and make the provision by giving his son on our behalf?

948
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,220
 Think about David, David killed the giant of Goliath

949
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,440
 and Jesus killed the giant of sin and Satan and death.

950
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,380
 Jonah spent three days in the belly of a whale

951
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,840
 and Jesus spent three days at a tomb.

952
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,340
 All of it has been pointing to Jesus.

953
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,860
 He is the Lion of Judah.

954
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,820
 He is the lamb and the sacrificial lamb

955
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,900
 that died on behalf of you and me and all of humanity.

956
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,980
 He's the rock, he's the light, he's the king,

957
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,780
 he's the prophet, he's the shepherd.

958
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,100
 And it all points to him.

959
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,060
 And Jesus looks these guys in the eyes

960
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,020
 and he walks them through all of it.

961
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,420
 And if you begin to read the Bible,

962
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,940
 you'll be introduced to the one who it's all about,

963
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,160
 who life is all about.

964
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,700
 And the one who frankly is the reason we trust it,

965
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,780
 who gave his life for you and for me.

966
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,480
 Every week listening, there are people

967
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,080
 who not only have not understood what the Bible is,

968
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,340
 they've never understood what the gospel, the good news,

969
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,460
 that's just what the word gospel means.

970
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,860
 What that is, and here, let me just give it to you.

971
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,900
 It's that God came to this earth in the form of Jesus

972
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,740
 and he loved you so much, he died for you and for me.

973
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,420
 He gave his life.

974
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,800
 We didn't deserve it, we don't earn it.

975
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,100
 We could never earn it.

976
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,740
 And he gave his life and he died.

977
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,660
 And then he rose from the dead three days later

978
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,780
 and he defeated death.

979
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,540
 And on that day where he rose, death died.

980
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,760
 And when he rose, it was like the payment for sins,

981
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,060
 it was like the check cleared.

982
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,660
 It was like the credit card when you're paying for something

983
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,620
 and it goes through and you're like, yes.

984
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,020
 The payment was enough, it was more than enough.

985
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,900
 And now anyone who puts their faith and trust

986
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,680
 in what Jesus did on the cross,

987
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,900
 accepting that God, you paid for everything, it's true.

988
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,740
 And I can believe it.

989
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
 And you gave your life

990
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,740
 and if I'm gonna have eternal life with you,

991
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,300
 it's because you gave your life for me.

992
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,860
 Anyone who puts their faith and trust

993
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,780
 in what Jesus did for them has eternal life

994
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,320
 and experiences the fulfillment of every prophecy

995
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,120
 and all of the points

996
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,100
 and everything that the scripture is about.

997
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,480
 And tonight, if you've never had that moment,

998
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,100
 this is your night.

999
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,660
 And the God who is there has had you stumble

1000
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,320
 listening onto this right now

1001
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,960
 and wherever you listen to this,

1002
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,680
 because he hasn't forgotten you

1003
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,980
 and he gave his life to prove and show that.

1004
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,060
 Let me pray.

1005
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,780
 Father, thank you that every word of God in the Bible

1006
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,740
 points to the ultimate word of God, which is Jesus.

1007
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,160
 Thank you that you are the sacrifice for sins.

1008
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,700
 You're the greater David, the greater Adam,

1009
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,260
 the greater Jonah, you're greater than all of them.

1010
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,760
 And every page and every word points to you, our King.

1011
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,000
 I pray for anyone listening right now

1012
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,060
 who candidly sits behind the smoke screen

1013
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,380
 of I don't want to believe it

1014
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,780
 'cause if then I'd have to change,

1015
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,100
 you would pierce and penetrate

1016
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,620
 and they'd stop wondering what would I have to change,

1017
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,240
 but could it be true?

1018
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,060
 And you would show to them that it is.

1019
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,140
 Thank you that you gave your life

1020
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,060
 and that anyone who trusts in that can have eternal life.

1021
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,520
 We worship you now in song, amen.

1022
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:56,520
