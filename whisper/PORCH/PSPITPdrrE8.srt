1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,560
 All right, what is up?

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,800
 Everyone tuning in from wherever you are listening

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,840
 and friends that are here today.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,720
 I've got a handful of friends that are jumping up

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,960
 as we continue this series, Fact Check,

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,320
 where we are putting Christian beliefs on the stand,

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,180
 so to speak, and examining and evaluating,

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,860
 is this belief something that I can really be confident

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,700
 is true?

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,040
 A lot of things that we've been told,

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,080
 if you've grew up in the church, you have a Christian faith.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,600
 And so each week we've been covering different ideas

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,540
 or beliefs that are a part of Christianity and examining,

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,120
 are we sure that's true?

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,840
 Can we fact check that?

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,600
 Let me start by telling a little bit of story

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,240
 that'll tell us some direction for where I'm going.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,000
 Every year, in recent history,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,080
 I have gone and had a dermatologist appointment.

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
 Have you guys, did you guys go to the dermatologist?

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,000
 Anybody here?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,840
 Yeah, you do.

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,660
 Come on, my man.

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,620
 Hey, if you can't tell,

26
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,360
 I'm what you would call extra Caucasian.

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
 And so I, for sure, have to make sure that I go

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,100
 and skin cancer doesn't feel like fun.

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,000
 Nobody's got time for that.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,980
 And so every single year I go in there

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,780
 and it's one of my least favorite things.

32
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,800
 And here's why.

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,960
 There's several things that are involved.

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,240
 You know what I'm talking about if you've been there.

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,720
 You kind of get in the room,

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,040
 you sit in that little doctor's office,

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
 you're waiting in the room.

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,960
 They tell you to get in your underwear.

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
 So you're sitting there like in your underwear.

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,080
 The doctor comes in and he begins

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,120
 to just like inspect everything.

42
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,000
 And so he's sitting there with his assistant,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,640
 just looking over your entire body

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
 like he's a mommy baboon or something,

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,960
 looking and making sure, seeing like,

46
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,000
 man, this doesn't look normal.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,340
 And what is this over here?

48
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,760
 And every time I've gone,

49
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,620
 he'll like flag something where he's like,

50
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,440
 oh, this doesn't look good.

51
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,480
 And he circles it with a Sharpie.

52
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,580
 And then he's like, we're going to have to take a graft

53
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,260
 of that and send it off to the lab

54
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,280
 because it looks like it possibly may be cancerous.

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,400
 And it just like produces this angst in me

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,520
 where I'm like, oh man, I'm about to go find out.

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,720
 Thankfully it hasn't ever been cancerous

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,240
 when it's come back.

59
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,320
 But every time that I have that exam

60
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,080
 or a doctor's appointment coming up,

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,020
 I'm like, oh gosh, I like, I do not want to go.

62
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,200
 I just want to even pretend like I don't have anything.

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 I just want to move on.

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
 I don't even know that I even want to know the truth

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,520
 if there is something suspect, you know,

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,640
 on my body that shouldn't be there.

67
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,280
 And I don't even want to go to a doctor

68
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,200
 and have that examination.

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,600
 Just puts like a week of anxiety in my head and mind

70
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,080
 while I wait to get that, you know, graft back.

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,900
 And what does that have to do

72
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,280
 with what we're talking about tonight?

73
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
 Well, in a lot of ways,

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,440
 I think that is the experience of this desire

75
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,100
 that I'm not even sure I want to know the truth.

76
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,040
 And I don't want to always know everything there.

77
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,380
 It's how a lot of Christians feel

78
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,660
 as it relates to the topic of science.

79
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,100
 There's a hesitation on, you know,

80
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,240
 I just don't want to spend too much time

81
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,080
 looking into the scientific realm.

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,440
 And I'm not even sure that I want to know everything

83
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,940
 that is involved with, you know, evolution or creation

84
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,780
 or the big bang.

85
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,740
 And it just feels like, you know, if I did know it,

86
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,380
 the possibility that my faith could begin to unravel,

87
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,800
 I just don't even want to think about that.

88
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
 Good vibes only, I don't want to know.

89
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,380
 And the crazy thing is, as Christians,

90
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,760
 we believe that all truth is God's.

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,620
 We believe that there isn't any truth out there

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,500
 that could dismantle this thing.

93
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,000
 And science, as we understand science,

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,580
 is something God created.

95
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,260
 Anytime there's a scientific discovery,

96
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,540
 it's not something we need to be afraid of.

97
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,640
 It's something that explains, oh, that is how God did it.

98
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,200
 So tonight, I want to talk about the idea

99
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,160
 of science and Christianity.

100
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,720
 Specifically, I want to fact check,

101
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,700
 does science or that science doesn't contradict Christianity.

102
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,960
 Like, let's talk a little bit about that.

103
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
 'Cause I think a lot of people, if you're anything like me,

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,360
 you went to a college or a university and you sat there

105
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
 and you had professors go,

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,340
 this is why we can't trust the Bible.

107
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,160
 Christianity has been disproven.

108
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,240
 Evolution makes it no longer necessary for God.

109
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,900
 We know that the biblical narrative is not true.

110
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,680
 And you were told that you can't even really trust

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,000
 the faith that you grew up with,

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,780
 that your parents said was worth trusting in.

113
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,500
 That science has really just proven a lot of it.

114
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,300
 Maybe there's some truth, but not all of it.

115
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
 And I want to talk tonight about the fact

116
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,200
 that science doesn't contradict Christianity.

117
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,000
 Specifically, I want to look at three buckets.

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,720
 So we won't have time to do an exhaustive look

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,120
 at all of this, but as best I can,

120
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,440
 I want to talk about the Big Bang Theory,

121
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,560
 not the TV show, the theory, the idea of evolution.

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,240
 And then I just want to talk high level

123
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,640
 about science, Christianity, what are they even pursuit of

124
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
 and how they don't contradict one another.

125
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
 So the first thing I want to dive into,

126
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,340
 if you take notes, is does the Big Bang,

127
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,720
 the Big Bang Theory, contradict Christianity?

128
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,640
 What is the Big Bang Theory?

129
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,440
 Big Bang Theory is a belief system

130
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,440
 almost unanimously embraced today in the scientific community

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,560
 that the origin of our universe had a beginning.

132
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,600
 There was an origin, there was a moment in time

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
 where the universe began to exist.

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,160
 A lot of this comes down to Einstein

135
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,060
 and his theory of relativity and expanding universe.

136
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,000
 And basically, over the last 100 years,

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
 science shifted from going,

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,980
 hey, the universe may be eternal, a steady state theory,

139
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,320
 or there may have been the universe always,

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,560
 to no, there was a moment in time where it all began.

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,680
 Stephen Hawking's, who, anybody seen

142
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,560
 the Theory of Everything when that came out?

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
 Yeah, you have.

144
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,320
 He said this, Stephen Hawking's incredibly brilliant guy

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
 in his book, A Brief History of Time.

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
 "Virtually everyone now believes

147
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
 "the universe had a beginning.

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
 "Many people do not like that idea

149
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,320
 "that it has a beginning

150
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,740
 "because it smacks of divine intervention."

151
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,640
 There was a professor from Princeton University,

152
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 a professor of physics,

153
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,700
 he wrote a book called The First Three Minutes.

154
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,540
 What an interesting thing.

155
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,520
 And The First Three Minutes

156
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,760
 was on the first three minutes of the universe.

157
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,640
 And he basically studied it and worked on producing,

158
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,200
 hey, this is what the first three minutes

159
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,080
 in universe history, when the creation happened,

160
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
 this is what it was like.

161
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,040
 And here's how he summarizes what took place initially.

162
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,480
 That at the beginning, there was a bright explosion

163
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,240
 of light and energy,

164
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,420
 and the universe was filled with light and heat.

165
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,200
 The Christian understanding

166
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,160
 does not in any way contradict

167
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,560
 the scientific idea of the Big Bang Theory.

168
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,640
 Why do I say that?

169
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,400
 What he just said is, hey, there was a moment in time

170
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,360
 where there wasn't anything,

171
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,240
 and then all of a sudden there's this explosion of light

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,760
 and the universe was created.

173
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,940
 What are we told in Genesis chapter one,

174
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,460
 in the first handful of words on the page?

175
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,300
 Again, this isn't like,

176
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,560
 I'm not reading this from Christian.com,

177
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,560
 I'm reading it from an MIT professor

178
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
 in his book on the first three minutes,

179
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,600
 universally almost accepted this is how it took place.

180
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
 An explosion of light and the universe began.

181
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,280
 Genesis says, in the beginning,

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,900
 God created the heavens and the earth.

183
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,800
 The very first thing that he says is created.

184
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,740
 And God said, let there be light.

185
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,080
 And there was light.

186
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,820
 The idea of a Big Bang is not a problem for Christianity.

187
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,100
 If anything, it's a problem for any type of belief

188
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,220
 or system that doesn't involve God.

189
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,460
 The Big Bang Theory was actually, oddly enough,

190
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,700
 created or came up or coined

191
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,620
 by a Belgian Catholic priest named George Lamarck.

192
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,700
 I think we have a picture of George.

193
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,540
 There he is.

194
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,820
 There's George doing some math problems.

195
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,060
 He's actually hanging out with Einstein,

196
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
 I think in another one of the pictures.

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
 But he came up with this idea or this teaching

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,800
 that the Big Bang was something that was created

199
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,560
 and happened because a big God caused it to take place.

200
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,480
 Or furthermore, I just want you to think about the idea

201
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,280
 of like Genesis 1, like let's say it's true,

202
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,120
 maybe you don't believe me,

203
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,340
 but just go with me for a second.

204
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,120
 God creates the heavens and the earth

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,160
 and he says, let there be light.

206
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,200
 What do you expect would happen

207
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,360
 when God creates into the world

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
 or creates the universe in a moment?

209
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,080
 Of course, there's going to be a big bang,

210
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,260
 a loud volume-filled eruption

211
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,000
 as everything that we see exists comes into existence.

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,580
 And a Belgian priest comes up with this idea

213
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,000
 and it wasn't a contradiction to his faith.

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
 Big Bang didn't push him away from God.

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,540
 If anything, it supported it, reinforced his belief

216
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,420
 that there was a big God behind the Big Bang.

217
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,800
 Science was a road sign that pointed to God,

218
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,480
 not away from him.

219
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,400
 There's a leading NASA scientist

220
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,560
 that was a part of, I believe, Apollo 11.

221
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,480
 It may have been Apollo 13,

222
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,760
 but he was one of the leading scientists in NASA

223
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,600
 and he was an astronomer.

224
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,280
 He basically studied galaxies and all that stuff.

225
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,000
 One of the leading astronomers that was out there

226
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,400
 was a Colombian professor and head of physics

227
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,080
 and astronomy at Columbia University.

228
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,480
 His name was Robert Jastrow and he wrote a book

229
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,360
 and he was an agnostic as it related to religion.

230
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,540
 But in studying kind of the universe and what we know,

231
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,880
 he came to the conclusion that, man,

232
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,760
 it really does align with what the Bible says.

233
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
 He's not a Christian.

234
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,880
 He just said, it aligns with the first, you know,

235
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,920
 a couple chapters that we see there.

236
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,560
 Here's what he wrote.

237
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,600
 "Now we see that the astronomical evidence

238
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,520
 "leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world.

239
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,660
 "The details differ, but the essential elements

240
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,700
 "in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis

241
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,860
 "are the same."

242
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,200
 He goes on to say, "For the scientist,"

243
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,160
 again, this is a leading NASA scientist.

244
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,840
 This isn't like, you know, Christian dad out there

245
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,680
 writing this.

246
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,080
 This is a leading thinker who worked

247
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,960
 with White House administrations as a part of some

248
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,480
 of the most significant launchings in terms of NASA,

249
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,460
 saying, "This is what we've discovered.

250
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,500
 "For the scientist who's lived by his faith

251
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,760
 "in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream.

252
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
 "He scaled the mountain of ignorance,"

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
 as it relates to who actually,

254
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
 or how did the world come into existence,

255
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
 or how did the universe get created?

256
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,760
 He scaled it and he begins to discover what happened.

257
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,000
 "He's about to conquer the highest peak,

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,500
 "and as he pulls himself over the rock,

259
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,760
 "he's greeted with a band of theologians,"

260
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,700
 that's just a big word for like people who study the Bible,

261
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,680
 "who have been sitting there for centuries,

262
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,220
 "for thousands of years saying,

263
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,120
 "hey, we knew there was an explosion of light

264
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,300
 "and a big bang,

265
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,040
 "because a big God started and created it."

266
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
 You may be thinking, and here's where,

267
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,040
 you know, I'll probably get an email,

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,180
 somebody's gonna be like, "No, wait a second,

269
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,900
 "the big bang has different theories

270
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,560
 "about like the Earth is 15 billion years old,

271
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,540
 "or a certain length of time that was involved,

272
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,920
 "and this many years were a part of it.

273
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,060
 "That contradicts the six-day creation

274
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,280
 "that we see in Genesis."

275
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,480
 No, not necessarily.

276
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,240
 And here's what probably a lot of you may know,

277
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,000
 and maybe if you're listening in and you don't have,

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,640
 you're still searching on what exactly do I believe,

279
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,300
 Christians don't all agree on whether or not

280
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,220
 the six-day creation, which is in Genesis chapter one,

281
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,140
 is a literal, is he literally saying six actual days?

282
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,580
 'Cause God's outside of time.

283
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,640
 The Bible says in 2 Peter chapter three,

284
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
 "With the Lord days like a thousand years,

285
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,820
 "a thousand years like a day."

286
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,820
 So is he saying like, "Hey, on the first day I made this,

287
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,980
 "was it actually a 24-hour day?

288
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,240
 "Or was that just speaking of a designated season

289
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,380
 "or time period in which God created it?"

290
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,980
 And a lot of Christians disagree.

291
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,920
 And I'm not here to really tell you

292
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,820
 which one you need to land on,

293
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,420
 I'm just saying that is not a contradiction

294
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,140
 to the scientific evidence we see

295
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,420
 as it relates to the Big Bang.

296
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,320
 And a lot of Christians believe,

297
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,100
 now, hey, the word in Hebrew, not to go too heady,

298
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,020
 but in that first chapter is the word yom,

299
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,260
 it just basically is a word even in the Bible,

300
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,900
 sometimes it's translated day,

301
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,820
 sometimes it's translated season,

302
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,620
 sometimes it's translated era.

303
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,740
 Which one is it?

304
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,660
 Man, you decide.

305
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,040
 I wouldn't die on any of those hills

306
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,700
 because it doesn't change anything

307
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,500
 about the fundamental beliefs of the teachings of Jesus

308
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,940
 and the message of the Bible.

309
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,640
 The Big Bang is not a problem

310
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,940
 and doesn't contradict Christianity.

311
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,980
 It is a problem for a belief that doesn't involve God.

312
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
 Here's why I say that.

313
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,860
 I mean, it goes almost without saying

314
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,660
 it's why less and less people

315
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,600
 are able to hold onto the Big Bang itself

316
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,420
 as an explanation for why God wouldn't be there.

317
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,060
 The reason why it would contradict the idea of God

318
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,180
 or is a problem for any view in life

319
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,300
 that doesn't involve God is because without,

320
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,300
 you take God out, what caused the Big Bang?

321
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,460
 Like what was behind it?

322
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,620
 And this is where people begin to go,

323
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,100
 you know, I don't really know.

324
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
 But think, none of us would live that way.

325
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,700
 Like, I want everybody right here to think.

326
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,980
 Have you ever had one of those moments

327
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,340
 where you like heard something outside

328
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,060
 and it was like a gunshot and you're like,

329
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,820
 dude, what is going, was that a gunshot

330
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,740
 or hopefully a firework or what is going on

331
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,140
 with the neighbors down the street?

332
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,540
 And honey, lock the door.

333
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,220
 And you have that moment where you're like,

334
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,340
 man, what was that?

335
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,240
 Am I alone?

336
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,800
 Maybe I just live in hood or something.

337
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,880
 And when that happens, here's what nobody does.

338
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,860
 Nobody goes, hey, did you hear that?

339
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,220
 Yeah, I did, but I'm pretty confident nothing caused it.

340
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,820
 It just was a Big Bang.

341
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,020
 There's no explanation behind it.

342
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,780
 All of us would rationally go,

343
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,940
 okay, that doesn't make any sense.

344
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,180
 So when you take God out of the equation,

345
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,660
 if anything, the Big Bang theory was so devastating

346
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,380
 to the worldview that doesn't hold God in it

347
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,580
 because it begs the question of like,

348
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,060
 then what caused it?

349
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,320
 And it takes a lot more faith to say nothing.

350
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,740
 Just like in that scenario, it takes a lot less faith

351
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,900
 to say, I think that was a gun that caused a gunshot.

352
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,060
 It's much more leap of faith to say,

353
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,560
 no, I think nothing caused the gunshot.

354
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,500
 In the same way, it's a bigger leap of faith to say,

355
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,580
 hey, I think nothing caused everything I see around me.

356
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,340
 Then it is to say, maybe there could be a God

357
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,020
 and a big one that caused that Big Bang.

358
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,980
 Okay, the second reason it's problematic

359
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,660
 is because not just like who caused it,

360
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,940
 but who designed everything that you see around us

361
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,140
 without a designer or God behind those things.

362
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,980
 You begin to look at the world and you're like,

363
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,500
 it just is increasingly challenging to believe.

364
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,100
 Things are so intricate and complex

365
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,860
 and finely tuned of our universe.

366
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,700
 Like, what do I mean by that?

367
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,780
 There are things that if you change them,

368
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,500
 like the smallest degree, you guys are smart,

369
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
 so you probably know all this,

370
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,940
 but you change them like the tiniest little fraction

371
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,620
 of a fraction degree and life would not exist on the planet.

372
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,460
 What do I mean?

373
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,280
 Like, here's a couple.

374
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,860
 If the earth rotation took any longer than 24 hours,

375
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,740
 temperatures would be too extreme.

376
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,220
 Alternatively, if the rotation period were shorter,

377
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,780
 atmospheric winds velocity would be too great.

378
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,980
 Large planets, nobody probably has wondered this.

379
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,220
 This was like fascinating to me.

380
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,780
 I thought it was interesting.

381
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,140
 You ever wondered like, why is Jupiter there?

382
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,300
 Like, why?

383
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,580
 What is it doing out there?

384
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,940
 Why would God make this like giant,

385
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,340
 and it's like the biggest of all of them?

386
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,460
 Like, what is Jupiter doing out there?

387
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,660
 One of the things that Jupiter does,

388
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,500
 in case you're wondering,

389
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,420
 this is how like important it actually is

390
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,900
 to the world around us,

391
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,700
 is that Jupiter, if it were not in its current orbit,

392
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,900
 the earth would be bombarded with space material,

393
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,660
 such as comets and meteors.

394
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,620
 Jupiter's gravitational field acts

395
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,260
 like a cosmic vacuum cleaner

396
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,740
 to attract space debris away from the earth.

397
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,920
 Here's another one, the earth's mantle,

398
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,340
 which is just like the ground around us

399
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,380
 or the outside of the earth.

400
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,260
 If the thickness of the earth's crust were greater,

401
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,500
 too much oxygen would be transferred

402
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,820
 to the crust to support human life.

403
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,780
 If it were any thinner,

404
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,540
 volcanic and tectonic activity would make life impossible.

405
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,740
 The world around us, these are three,

406
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,580
 there's an infinite,

407
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,620
 or there's a humongous list about this world.

408
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,660
 It's like incredibly well-designed.

409
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,540
 It's finely tuned.

410
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
 And if you take God out of the picture and equation,

411
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,940
 who did that?

412
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,100
 Why is it that way?

413
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,620
 I'm confident, if we were all hanging out

414
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,860
 and walking along the beach,

415
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,140
 and we came across like a piece of plywood,

416
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,700
 or a piece of not plywood, just like driftwood

417
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
 that was kind of up there on the shore,

418
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,180
 most of us would be like,

419
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,220
 you know, I don't know where that came from.

420
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,380
 My guess is probably one of these trees back here,

421
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,580
 and that's how it ended up here.

422
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,740
 But if we walked and, you know,

423
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,860
 we came across and we picked up,

424
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,580
 I found an iPhone and I picked it up

425
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,540
 and we're all walking there together,

426
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,380
 and I picked it up in the sand.

427
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,940
 And I was like, guys, dude, this, look at this.

428
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,180
 Look at this thing that natural forces

429
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,020
 in a collision of saltwater and wind and forces

430
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,560
 and things brought together.

431
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,720
 It's unbelievable.

432
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,900
 I mean, look at all the detail.

433
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,300
 This is unbelievably complex and incredible.

434
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,580
 You guys would go, you're an idiot.

435
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,740
 Somebody dropped their iPhone.

436
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,580
 That's where that came from.

437
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,420
 Think about it.

438
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,980
 I mean, I know it's silly,

439
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,340
 but all of us would rationally connect the dots.

440
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,060
 The world around us is infinitely more complex

441
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,940
 than an iPhone is.

442
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,860
 And yet people will hide behind,

443
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,160
 that, you know, it doesn't have to have a creator there.

444
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,740
 And often, just to be candid with you,

445
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,480
 generally speaking, the people who are like,

446
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,740
 no, there doesn't have to be a God behind the Big Bang.

447
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,580
 The reason they're there

448
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,180
 is they don't want there to be a God behind the Big Bang.

449
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,100
 Not because it makes sense.

450
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,260
 Not because it's rationally there any more than going,

451
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,140
 no, there doesn't have to be.

452
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,160
 It's possible that this could have been made by the wind

453
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,500
 and by, you know, like a tornado came together

454
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,620
 and, you know, just things smoothed it out

455
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,360
 and chiseled over time.

456
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,380
 Sure.

457
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,460
 Is it possible?

458
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,400
 I guess.

459
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,580
 Is it probable or rational or logical?

460
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,420
 No.

461
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,180
 And generally speaking,

462
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,380
 that's why most people hide behind like,

463
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,300
 oh, the Big Bang doesn't have to have God

464
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,740
 'cause they don't want it to.

465
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,640
 But the Big Bang complements and confirms the Bible.

466
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,560
 It doesn't contradict it.

467
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,740
 Now, what I think is more powerful,

468
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,780
 or not more powerful, more problematic,

469
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,220
 often, idea in terms of science and Christianity

470
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,220
 contradicting is evolution.

471
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,540
 Big Bang, you know, even most astronomers,

472
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,000
 scientists, leading thinkers will go like,

473
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,380
 yeah, the Big Bang is a pretty tough one to escape.

474
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,060
 But evolution, that is a field in which, you know,

475
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,980
 it totally contradicts the biblical narrative.

476
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,880
 So does evolution contradict Christianity?

477
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,380
 First, let's define what evolution is.

478
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,260
 So most of us probably went to a school

479
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,180
 or studied at some point a textbook that brought up like,

480
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,620
 hey, here's what evolution is.

481
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,940
 Evolution being the theory that,

482
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,700
 there's a couple of parts of it.

483
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:36,180
 One, there would be micro evolution or minor evolution,

484
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,820
 which would be small adaptations within a species over time.

485
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,180
 So this science, generally speaking, has confirmed

486
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,800
 that there have been small adaptations over time

487
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,760
 that allow whatever species in the species itself

488
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,700
 to be more effective at surviving.

489
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,540
 Does that make sense?

490
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,740
 So a giraffe, one of the theories behind a giraffe

491
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,100
 would be, hey, the giraffes with taller necks

492
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,020
 were able to reach leaves and trees higher.

493
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,160
 And so those just ended up living

494
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,940
 while other ones weren't able to get as much food.

495
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,000
 And so over time, just giraffes had higher necks.

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,180
 Macro evolution would involve the idea

497
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,340
 that everything on the planet spontaneously generated

498
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,900
 from some amoeba life form,

499
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,400
 and that began to evolve and adapt.

500
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,180
 And it eventually became an organism

501
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,420
 that turned into a fish,

502
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,800
 then they have turned into just an amphibious lizard

503
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,420
 that turned into something that walks on land.

504
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,860
 And then it turned into a mammal and kind of everything.

505
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,300
 And the tree of life evolved from the same thing.

506
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,080
 You may have seen something like this

507
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,740
 or seen the tree of life as it relates to evolution.

508
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,860
 I know you guys can't see it, but it's right there.

509
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,320
 Where every single thing kind of connects back

510
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,220
 to the same thing.

511
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,200
 The problem with this idea,

512
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,460
 and you probably have never heard this,

513
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,620
 or maybe you had professors that were like,

514
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,740
 hey, it's a proven thing you can take to the bank,

515
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,980
 is that those who study this field even acknowledge

516
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,500
 we have not found the transitional fossils in between those.

517
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,420
 In other words, if you had a giraffe

518
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,560
 that eventually morphed into an elephant,

519
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,480
 you would think that we'd have a girelephant

520
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,880
 in between there at some point,

521
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,700
 where it was like kind of giraffe-ish looking elephant

522
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,280
 and it morphed along the way.

523
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,180
 And we don't have evidence of that taking place.

524
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,780
 We have evidence of small adaptations in the fossil record.

525
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,500
 We don't have the evidence of the intermediaries.

526
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,340
 Does that make sense?

527
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,900
 Like the kind of in between ones that are there.

528
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,740
 And if you don't believe me,

529
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,700
 here's Harvard professor, paleontologist, Stephen Jay Gould,

530
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,880
 who says this, he's an atheist, by the way.

531
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,740
 "The extreme rarity of the transitional form

532
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,900
 in a fossil record," which is like those in between ones,

533
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,660
 "persists as the trade secret of paleontology."

534
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,660
 As in paleontologists know it, but everybody else doesn't.

535
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,940
 "The evolutionary trees that adorn your textbooks

536
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,660
 have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches.

537
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,520
 The rest is inference.

538
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,020
 However reasonable, not the evidence of fossils.

539
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,740
 Darwin," Darwin, Charles Darwin,

540
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,940
 came up with kind of the whole evolutionary theory,

541
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,120
 origin of species.

542
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,340
 "Darwin's argument still persists

543
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,460
 as the favored escape of most paleontologists

544
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,700
 from the embarrassment of a record

545
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,700
 that seems to show little of evolution directly."

546
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,660
 Here's what he just said.

547
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,500
 This is a Harvard professor.

548
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,700
 Again, you should Google this quote, look it up.

549
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,160
 This is not coming from sources that are Christian biased.

550
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,520
 This is a Harvard professor writing

551
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,680
 in "Evolution's Erratic Pace Natural History,"

552
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,880
 Stephen Jay Gould.

553
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
 Here's what he just said.

554
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,880
 "Hey, the paleontologists," and people believe this,

555
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,360
 but they don't believe it 'cause we have a record.

556
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
 They believe it by faith.

557
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,560
 "We only have," and this is kind of

558
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,320
 what only paleontologists realize,

559
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
 "When you look at that tree

560
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,440
 with all the different animals that are on it,

561
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,520
 we really only have the ends of those animals

562
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,080
 and maybe some minor adaptations on things,

563
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,380
 but we don't have an ability in the fossils

564
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,860
 that would allow us to trace further

565
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,420
 and further and further back.

566
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:05,800
 The idea of evolution at a macro level is just not proven."

567
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
 And so you believe it.

568
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,560
 If you believe it, as much as this may upset you by faith,

569
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,220
 according to Harvard professor Stephen Jay Gould,

570
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,040
 here's the problems with evolution.

571
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,380
 Number one, the fossils don't support it.

572
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,120
 We just said that.

573
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
 Number two, science can't reproduce it.

574
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
 I want you to think about this

575
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,200
 'cause it's a pretty interesting thing to think about.

576
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,560
 The idea of evolution is that species could come together

577
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,840
 and begin to slightly adapt and adapt,

578
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,880
 and they could interbreed with other types of animals

579
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,960
 and other species, and it would form new animals

580
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,320
 that would be a part of kind of the chain

581
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,520
 spreading and going out.

582
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,320
 Today, if a scientist or if a breeder

583
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,360
 or somebody who wanted to work on speciation

584
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,160
 and take different species and breed them together

585
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,620
 to make a new type of animal,

586
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,880
 in a test tube scientific environment,

587
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,400
 and they began to go like, "Here's what we're gonna do.

588
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,600
 "We're gonna take a lion,

589
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
 "and we're gonna mix it with this horse.

590
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,800
 "It's gonna be a lorce.

591
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,680
 "It's gonna be amazing."

592
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,880
 They can't do it.

593
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,560
 We can do it within species.

594
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,080
 We can do it within dogs.

595
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
 You can take a dog, you take a chihuahua and a poodle,

596
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,080
 and you make a puh-wah-wah,

597
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,160
 but we can't take a cat and a dog and make a dad.

598
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,760
 Think about that.

599
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,320
 It can't happen.

600
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,720
 Even when you go in the same family,

601
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,280
 you take a horse and a donkey, you guys know this,

602
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,080
 you can make a mule.

603
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,400
 A mule can't reproduce.

604
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,240
 It's sterile.

605
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,060
 They can't continue on,

606
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,880
 and that's in the same family of animals.

607
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,680
 So the idea that, hey, animals over time,

608
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,960
 by natural selection and natural processes

609
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,720
 and a blind, which is what the process of evolution would be,

610
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,440
 this blind guiding force to continue to drive animals

611
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,720
 to evolve and change and procreate,

612
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,140
 if we can't do it with science intentionally trying,

613
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,100
 why would anyone believe that nature

614
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,980
 was somehow able to do it over time?

615
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,460
 So the second problem is that science can't reproduce it,

616
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,940
 which is at the heart of what science does.

617
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,580
 They embrace things that they can observe,

618
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,100
 test, and reproduce.

619
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,060
 To scientifically conclude that evolution is a fact

620
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,120
 contradicts science.

621
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,780
 The third thing and third problem with it

622
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,440
 is that the idea that evolution is built on simpler things

623
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,080
 moving into more complex things.

624
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,620
 If enough time is given,

625
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,060
 simple things move into more complex things.

626
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,540
 Anybody who's been alive any amount of time here has seen

627
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,460
 that's not the way our world works.

628
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,900
 Things don't genuinely get more complex and more intricate

629
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,260
 and more impressive over time.

630
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,300
 More chaos is introduced.

631
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,140
 What do I mean?

632
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,500
 Like no one is ever, and I'll just hyper,

633
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 again, I'm condensing a time period really fast down,

634
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,460
 or condensing it, let me just explain.

635
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,380
 No one would go into there, anyone like bike here?

636
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
 You got a bike?

637
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,040
 You got a bike, dude.

638
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,880
 Look at you.

639
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,700
 Oh, come on.

640
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,540
 You guys, anybody?

641
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,420
 He's got long legs.

642
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,300
 Looks like a biker.

643
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
 Biker, runner, triathlete.

644
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,460
 Okay, let's assume Seth had a bike.

645
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,060
 If he went into his bike or in his garage

646
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,660
 and his bike's hanging out there,

647
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,000
 he wouldn't, how crazy would it be

648
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,220
 for him to show up the next day and be like,

649
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,740
 oh man, this bike just turned into a golf cart.

650
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,860
 And then he showed up the next day and it turned into a car.

651
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,940
 And then he showed up the next day, it turned into two cars.

652
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,500
 And then it reproduces.

653
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,780
 So I've had two little baby cars,

654
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,940
 little mini Coopers out there,

655
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,540
 and then it turned into a spaceship over time.

656
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,840
 It would be crazy.

657
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,560
 The idea of simple things moving in the direction

658
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,340
 of becoming increasingly complex over time

659
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,460
 doesn't make sense.

660
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,740
 It doesn't operate in the same way

661
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,220
 the world around us works.

662
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,140
 And in that scenario, you may be going,

663
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,660
 oh, but that's like a dead object.

664
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,480
 It could with a living object.

665
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,540
 In what world do simpler things

666
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,540
 get increasingly more complex entirely on their own?

667
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,500
 You add nothing to it.

668
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,800
 There's no mind and mental intelligent design

669
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,640
 that's a part of it.

670
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,220
 It just is gonna get increasingly more impressive

671
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,260
 on its own.

672
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,900
 It doesn't.

673
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,320
 And fourth problem with the idea of evolution

674
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,280
 is spontaneous generation,

675
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,980
 which is at the heart of the entire thing.

676
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,820
 What does that, what do I mean?

677
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,300
 That there was this blob and this kind of melting pot

678
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,060
 of forces that came together in this cocktail

679
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,220
 of things in our world.

680
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,300
 And somehow inanimate objects spit out life.

681
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,940
 And it may have just been bacteria or an amoeba

682
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,140
 or something really small,

683
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,180
 but spontaneously it was generated and came from nothing.

684
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,900
 And then there was something.

685
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,900
 The idea that nothing or something came from nothing

686
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,700
 makes no sense.

687
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,820
 Yesterday, let me use this.

688
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,660
 I got a call from my wife at 5.30.

689
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,900
 She was like, hey, there's a bird in our house.

690
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,100
 And I was like, a bird in the house?

691
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,220
 She said, yeah, there's a bird.

692
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,060
 It's been flying around.

693
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,540
 It's trying to keep the dog from killing it.

694
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,140
 And I've been calling animal control

695
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,820
 and animal control is apparently not doing stuff

696
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,660
 'cause corona.

697
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,020
 I'm like, you called animal control?

698
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,820
 That escalated so fast.

699
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,620
 And she's like, yeah, I didn't know what to do.

700
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,580
 There's a bird in our house.

701
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,700
 I was like, you know, I don't want to hurt the bird.

702
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,540
 And what do I do?

703
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,060
 And so I came home and she was just like,

704
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,320
 hey, I just tried to shoo it upstairs.

705
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,420
 I don't know where it is.

706
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,380
 I go and I'm looking all throughout the house.

707
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,360
 I don't even know how big the bird is.

708
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,820
 So I'm kind of going like,

709
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,560
 how is this not like a hawk or anything?

710
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,380
 It's like, it's a little bird, right?

711
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,220
 And she's like, yeah, it's kind of a little bird.

712
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,260
 So eventually I find it.

713
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,740
 It's in our master bedroom closet.

714
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,960
 I get a pillow and I just try to like guide it out the door

715
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,620
 and get the bird out of the door.

716
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,740
 You know what never crossed my mind?

717
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,020
 This bird came out of nowhere.

718
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,380
 This thing could have spontaneously generated.

719
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,980
 I mean, the doors were not open.

720
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,700
 The only way that this door,

721
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,380
 it's not like she was like, hey, come on in bird.

722
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,520
 And that's how it ended in the house.

723
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,220
 It must have spontaneously generated.

724
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,060
 It must've came out of nowhere

725
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,420
 and it just popped up there.

726
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,580
 No, because that's crazy.

727
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,820
 Maybe it came in through the chimney.

728
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,260
 I have no idea exactly how it came.

729
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,540
 Maybe she didn't even realize it,

730
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,740
 but one of the doors was open and it came in.

731
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,960
 But something and from somewhere that bird came.

732
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,940
 The idea of spontaneous generation

733
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,700
 is at the heart of the evolutionary theory

734
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,340
 and idea that something could spontaneously generate

735
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,420
 from nothing and something coming from nothing

736
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,740
 makes no sense.

737
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,380
 And anyone who tells you that it does

738
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,520
 is hiding behind a smoke screen

739
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,740
 where they do not want to believe there is a God.

740
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,100
 They're not hiding behind evidence

741
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,540
 that logically makes sense.

742
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,260
 And candidly, they have more faith than you do

743
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
 because they're going,

744
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,380
 hey, something came from nothing, which makes sense.

745
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,540
 No, it doesn't.

746
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,380
 And evolution does not contradict God

747
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,660
 and the macro evolution has not been proven.

748
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,500
 If anything, the picture that we get

749
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,620
 when we look at the fossil record

750
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,780
 and the world around us, when you look at it,

751
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,460
 aligns right with God.

752
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,300
 Or what do I say that?

753
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,420
 When you read Genesis chapter one,

754
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,620
 where he begins to talk about the creation of animals

755
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,820
 and mankind, he says, God created animals

756
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,140
 and he made fish and livestock

757
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,380
 and all those are living creatures that are on the ground.

758
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,820
 And he made them, he says it over and over,

759
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,820
 according to their kinds, according to their kinds,

760
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,860
 according to their kinds, like their species.

761
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,300
 They were placed in these groups

762
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,900
 and they reproduced in those groups.

763
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,260
 And then it says that he made man distinct

764
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,580
 from all other animals.

765
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,060
 It says, Genesis chapter one, verse 27,

766
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,060
 and God made man and woman in his image.

767
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,220
 In the image of God, he created them, male and female.

768
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,300
 And he said, hey, I'm giving you the ability.

769
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,020
 Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, it says.

770
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,700
 That they may rule over all that is,

771
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,980
 the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea,

772
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,900
 over livestock, all the wild animals,

773
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,420
 all the creatures that move along the ground.

774
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,060
 Am I, is that gonna convince you that God is there?

775
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,840
 No, but it aligns with what you see in our world.

776
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,980
 There's something distinct,

777
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,220
 like when God made all of creation, he says,

778
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,420
 I made just man in my image, uniquely.

779
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,220
 There's something distinct even about like humanity.

780
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,500
 Like why, if we all came and we all evolved

781
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,380
 and we're like, hey, but,

782
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,940
 and right behind us is the chimpanzee.

783
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,780
 Chimpanzees can do a lot of cool things.

784
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,620
 I don't know if you guys have seen it,

785
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
 like they can do sign language,

786
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,900
 some of them, they can learn some stuff.

787
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,180
 You know what they're not writing?

788
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,020
 Poetry, Shakespeare, playing music, like beautiful music.

789
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,720
 I mean, we can teach them to like.

790
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,940
 But think about that.

791
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,020
 That's the extent to which the highest height

792
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,500
 of the closest next animal in the world can catch up.

793
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,340
 Why?

794
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,680
 Because they weren't made in the image of God.

795
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,540
 They weren't given all the faculties and the reasoning

796
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,980
 and a soul and the ability to think and reason

797
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,820
 like humanity is.

798
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
 Whenever you think about the Bible,

799
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,480
 you may not even believe that,

800
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,380
 but that at least aligns with the world around you see.

801
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,120
 And it certainly aligns with the fossil record

802
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,420
 where animals seem to be groups in their kind,

803
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,960
 not in these transitional species.

804
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,460
 Finally, does science and Christianity contradict?

805
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,060
 Or does science contradict Christianity?

806
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,300
 No, of course you would expect me to say that.

807
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,880
 But the reason I say that is if it does,

808
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,840
 you have a big problem with the scientific community.

809
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,480
 And my guess is you're not a scientist

810
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,160
 because the average scientist believes in God,

811
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,320
 a personal God.

812
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,520
 And this is another stat that in case you think

813
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 I'm reading from, you know, christiandownatheist.com.

814
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,640
 This comes from the American Association

815
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,680
 of the Advancement of Science,

816
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,840
 conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2009.

817
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,240
 Said 51% of scientists say they believe in God

818
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,360
 or higher power.

819
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,000
 Christianity has fueled the advancement of science.

820
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,360
 The development of chemistry in the scientific world

821
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,120
 advanced in Western civilization, which was Christian

822
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,160
 and had a Judeo-Christian underlying to it,

823
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,240
 unlike any other place in the world.

824
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,920
 We're the only place where chemistry and biology,

825
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,840
 the way that it began to advance.

826
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,800
 Because Christians believed science was an exploration

827
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,660
 of how God made the world around us.

828
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,400
 They've been wed together and haven't been disconnected

829
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,960
 in a way that Christians were ever afraid.

830
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,920
 Some of the most famous scientists in history

831
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,100
 were Christians and they said this,

832
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,440
 or I'm sorry, let me list out some of them.

833
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,700
 Francis Bacon, he established the scientific method.

834
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,720
 You've probably heard of that.

835
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,960
 Isaac Newton, Michael Faraday,

836
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,600
 came up with the electromagnetic field theory.

837
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,420
 James Maxwell founded the electrodynamics.

838
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,760
 Louise Pastore, pasteurization, vaccination,

839
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,640
 immunization, bacteriology.

840
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,640
 Johannes Kepler, today, some of the leading thinkers

841
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,240
 in the scientific world see that science drives them to God,

842
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,760
 not away from God.

843
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,620
 One of those is Francis Collins.

844
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,360
 He was the founder of the Human Genome Project.

845
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,520
 He wrote a book called "The Language of God."

846
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,440
 He was a atheist until in his 20s,

847
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,560
 he began to study DNA and he looked at everything.

848
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,480
 And he began, he wrote a book called "The Language of God,"

849
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,520
 which was about DNA, where he looked at cells

850
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,440
 and he saw DNA.

851
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,760
 And you know what he discovered?

852
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,700
 He said in each cell of DNA,

853
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,320
 there contains enough information to fill 30,

854
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,280
 30 encyclopedias of structured information.

855
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,360
 When I read it, I'm reading the language of God.

856
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,840
 I'm seeing how he wove the DNA and things in our body.

857
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
 It didn't drive him away from God, it drove him to him.

858
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,760
 Rosalind Pickard, inventor of artificial,

859
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,400
 inventor and artificial intelligence expert.

860
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,760
 Invented effective computing, a professor at MIT,

861
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,960
 a follower of Christ.

862
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,460
 Ian Hutchinson, a nuclear science professor at MIT.

863
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,140
 Kenneth Miller, professor of biology at Brown University.

864
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,100
 And I could go on and on and on.

865
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,660
 If science contradicts Christianity,

866
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,860
 it certainly doesn't for them.

867
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,520
 And my guess is if you believe that,

868
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,280
 you are not a scientist.

869
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,540
 Because flip a coin and the average scientist

870
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,900
 is going to believe in God.

871
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,000
 Is gonna have a faith, you say they don't.

872
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,180
 The truth about science and Christianity,

873
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,860
 the reason why they don't contradict each other,

874
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,040
 is they share the same goal.

875
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,580
 Here's why I say that.

876
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,340
 The word science comes from a Latin word like scientia,

877
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,080
 which I probably butchered for somebody out there

878
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,060
 who speaks Latin.

879
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,220
 And that word means knowledge.

880
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,000
 The goal of science is to pursue knowledge and truth.

881
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,100
 The pursuit of truth.

882
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,800
 The goal of Christianity is not some blind,

883
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,460
 hey, we don't trust the world around us or trust facts,

884
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,320
 we're all about faith, blindly.

885
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,440
 It is the pursuit of truth.

886
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,700
 Jesus said you would know the truth

887
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,220
 and the truth would set you free.

888
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,400
 Paul in 2 Corinthians chapter 13 said,

889
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,380
 "For we cannot oppose," verse eight,

890
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,560
 "We cannot oppose the truth,

891
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,860
 "but must always stand for the truth."

892
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,020
 Christianity has always had at its epicenter in heart

893
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,060
 the pursuit of truth.

894
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,660
 The church was a part of funding and fueling

895
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,200
 Isaac Newton's research on gravitational theory.

896
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,260
 The church and Christians were the reason why Harvard,

897
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,600
 Princeton, Yale, Dartmouth, and Brown

898
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,040
 all began as Christian institutions.

899
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,760
 Harvard's original motto was truth for Christ

900
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,020
 and for the church.

901
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,480
 It is not an intellectual.

902
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,720
 In fact, if anything, Jesus says you cannot

903
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,000
 check your mind at the door and follow him.

904
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,700
 In Mark chapter 12, verse 30, he says,

905
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,100
 "I want you to love the Lord your God

906
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,880
 "with all of your heart, with all of your soul,

907
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,700
 "with all of your mind, with all of your mind,

908
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,820
 "with your mind and your strength."

909
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,460
 Christianity has nothing to be afraid of

910
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,280
 when it comes to science because every time

911
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,860
 there's a discovery, all it gets us the chance to do

912
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,420
 is say, "That's how God did it.

913
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,460
 "That's amazing."

914
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,020
 That's all that science is.

915
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,780
 And science really can't be anything beyond that

916
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
 because here's what science does.

917
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,780
 Like it has limits in what it can study.

918
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,700
 Why do I say that?

919
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,000
 Science is all about like what happened

920
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,280
 or kind of how it's there.

921
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,720
 It's not about why.

922
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,600
 Like, think about this.

923
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,560
 This is kind of profound to me,

924
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,080
 but maybe it'll only be to me.

925
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,920
 Like if tonight we all walked outside

926
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,600
 and in Dallas it's too overcast

927
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,760
 so we won't be able to see the stars,

928
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,720
 but if we were out in the country

929
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,700
 and we could see the stars and the stars

930
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,520
 had moved together and grouped up and it said,

931
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,020
 "Hey, yo, God is real.

932
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,500
 "His name is Jesus.

933
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,340
 "Told ya."

934
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,400
 Scientists would not go, "Huh.

935
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,340
 "Wow, I guess it's true."

936
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,320
 Science would say, "How did those all move together

937
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,000
 "and at what temperature are they burning

938
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,300
 "and how far away from us right now?"

939
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,500
 And they wouldn't be concerned with the actual message.

940
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,960
 They would just evaluate the contents or what

941
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,660
 and how it's there, not why.

942
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,760
 Because science has limits

943
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,300
 and it can't explain every single thing

944
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,180
 that there is out there.

945
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,180
 It is concerned about the pursuit of truth

946
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,680
 and providing data towards that truth.

947
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,100
 And as amazing as it is, and science is amazing,

948
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,580
 and Christians don't need to be afraid of it.

949
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,480
 We should embrace it.

950
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,620
 We should celebrate it.

951
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,780
 We should encourage it.

952
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,660
 But as amazing as it is, it still has limits

953
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,340
 where it can't be the extent of entire truth.

954
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,600
 In other words, there are certain things

955
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,280
 you just can't test in a test tube.

956
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,220
 There are certain things in this life

957
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,820
 where you can't go, "Man, it's repeatable and immeasurable."

958
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,660
 And we would all or most of us

959
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,580
 that would recognize their reality,

960
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,280
 but we wouldn't say science could do anything

961
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,020
 to test those and put it to, what do I say there?

962
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,080
 Like things like beauty.

963
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,280
 There's no way to evaluate and scientifically say

964
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
 even such a thing as beauty exists,

965
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,880
 especially you take away God, it does not.

966
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,600
 It's just something in your brain firing off going,

967
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,380
 "Oh man, it looks so pretty right now."

968
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,800
 Or, "She looks so pretty right now."

969
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,760
 Things like purpose, they don't exist.

970
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,840
 You're here with no purpose.

971
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,440
 And when you die, worms eat you and that's it.

972
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,240
 Apart from embracing of the understanding

973
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,800
 that God is there and he wove you together

974
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,320
 and he made you on purpose.

975
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,340
 Things that science can't explain like morality.

976
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,120
 Science cannot explain why Hitler doing what he did

977
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,920
 in Germany was wrong.

978
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,160
 It can just tell you what he did in Germany.

979
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,760
 It can't explain that it's wrong

980
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,640
 or the sense of morality in your heart that's like,

981
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,680
 "Man, there's real evil in the world around us."

982
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,880
 It can't explain that.

983
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,940
 Origin of life.

984
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,960
 The best explanations and attempts on explaining

985
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,120
 the origin of life fall short or just go,

986
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,720
 "I don't know, but it somehow existed."

987
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,460
 And they stop asking the question from there.

988
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,360
 But Christianity provides answers to all those.

989
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,580
 It says that things are beautiful

990
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,400
 because there's a God who is out there

991
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,680
 who's like an artist who painted and sees the works

992
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,320
 of his handiwork all over the night sky

993
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
 and all over the world around us.

994
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,080
 We're told that God made you with a purpose

995
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,100
 and he tells you that purpose is to know him,

996
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,940
 to make him known.

997
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,820
 And that's why no matter what you do with relationships

998
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,400
 or alcohol or a job, it never satisfies.

999
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,280
 It can't ever fill that

1000
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,000
 because your purpose wasn't to have those things.

1001
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,480
 It was to know God.

1002
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,120
 It tells us the origin of life happened with him

1003
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,840
 and he created you and he created the world around us

1004
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,720
 and he wove it together.

1005
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,600
 It tells us that morality is in your heart.

1006
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,960
 And there's something inside of you that says

1007
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
 there really is messed up people

1008
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,320
 or there's messed up actions.

1009
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
 What happened in Germany is not okay.

1010
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,680
 Sexual abuse is not okay.

1011
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,040
 And we're told the Bible says

1012
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,320
 that's because in Romans chapter two, 14, verse 14,

1013
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,400
 God says, "That's 'cause I put that there."

1014
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
 It gives an explanation for things

1015
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,720
 that science will never be able to do.

1016
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,940
 Science alone leaves you lacking.

1017
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,920
 Science plus Christianity provides answers

1018
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,480
 because they're both in the pursuit of truth.

1019
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,600
 And unlike the limits that are on science,

1020
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,320
 Christianity provides answers where science is limited.

1021
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,840
 And it does not contradict the answers

1022
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,560
 where science can give explanations.

1023
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,080
 Ultimately, the biggest, honestly,

1024
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,960
 smoke screen,

1025
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,520
 or the biggest reason why most people don't believe

1026
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
 this stuff is it's just a smoke screen, dude.

1027
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,020
 And if there's any part of you,

1028
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,140
 like look at me right now.

1029
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,640
 If there's any part of you that's like,

1030
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,080
 I don't want to believe in God.

1031
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,600
 Because if I do, I may have to stop smoking that

1032
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
 or stop doing that, or I may be accountable to someone.

1033
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,060
 If there's any part of you,

1034
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,160
 like just be honest with yourself.

1035
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,200
 You don't have to tell anybody.

1036
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,040
 Just be honest.

1037
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,560
 You owe it to yourself.

1038
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,000
 If there's any part of you that's like,

1039
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,620
 I really don't, I hope it's not true.

1040
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,840
 You should be concerned and think about that.

1041
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,040
 Could it be you're deceiving yourself

1042
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,960
 into trying to justify why?

1043
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,080
 No, no, no, man.

1044
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,480
 Evolution, evolution is why, you know,

1045
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,880
 I can't trust the Bible.

1046
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,320
 Could it be?

1047
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,300
 You don't want to.

1048
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,040
 Because you think it may involve you being accountable

1049
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,640
 or changing, or it's just easier to not.

1050
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,000
 And you're like me in that moment with the dermatology,

1051
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,160
 we're like, I don't want to know the truth.

1052
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,440
 And here's why that's a tragedy.

1053
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,280
 Let me close.

1054
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,680
 This past weekend, I had a chance to go with my wife

1055
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,840
 and Texas is like getting to open up a little bit more

1056
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,320
 where we can go kind of more out and about.

1057
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,360
 But we took the kids out to this park

1058
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,760
 up kind of in North Dallas.

1059
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,520
 And we went out there and we went on these different trails

1060
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,760
 and went all through the park that was out there.

1061
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,000
 And it wasn't like greenbelt trails.

1062
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,360
 It was like, you're going on hiking, kind of like dirt stuff.

1063
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,200
 I mean, it was really fun.

1064
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,360
 I had a four year old son, one and a half year old daughter

1065
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,560
 and my wife, and we're just walking through these trails.

1066
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,160
 Eventually I see this plant that I'm like,

1067
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,760
 I think that's poison ivy.

1068
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,200
 And I'm sitting there looking at it.

1069
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,280
 And it was in front of this view that we had gone up to see.

1070
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,080
 And it was just right in there in front of us.

1071
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,520
 And I'm thinking to myself, I think that's poison ivy.

1072
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,000
 And my son runs up and grabs the plant.

1073
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,760
 Which he, I don't know that he's ever grabbed

1074
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,960
 any plant before, but he grabs this plant,

1075
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,240
 starts ripping off the thing.

1076
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
 And I'm like talking to my wife, I'm like,

1077
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,720
 babe, I think that's poison ivy.

1078
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,200
 And she goes, no, that's not poison ivy.

1079
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,680
 I've had some bad experiences with poison ivy before.

1080
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,800
 So I'm a little paranoid, but I'm like, no, babe,

1081
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,040
 I really think it's poison ivy.

1082
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,880
 And she's like, no.

1083
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,080
 And I'm like, hey, if it is poison ivy,

1084
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,540
 we need to go wash him.

1085
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,200
 And he's like, a four year old doesn't understand

1086
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
 what poison ivy is.

1087
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,760
 He thinks it's like a character Batman fights or something.

1088
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,920
 So he's like, what does poison ivy mean?

1089
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,040
 And it's like, well, if you touch it,

1090
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,880
 it's going to have a rash.

1091
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,680
 So he starts touching his sister's face.

1092
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,340
 He starts touching all of us.

1093
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,960
 I mean, it was like, this is not good.

1094
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,560
 My wife is like, no, I don't think it is poison ivy.

1095
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,600
 And I'm going, I think it is.

1096
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,360
 Like, here's a picture of poison ivy

1097
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,740
 in case you haven't seen it in a while.

1098
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,480
 You guys can look there.

1099
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,960
 The top one is poison ivy.

1100
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,800
 And then Billy, show them the next one.

1101
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,320
 That is what we saw.

1102
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
 If you go back for a second, Billy,

1103
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
 it's kind of hard 'cause it's far away.

1104
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,960
 But if you can look at it, it's almost identical.

1105
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,720
 And I was like, babe, I'm telling you,

1106
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,120
 I think it is poison ivy.

1107
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,960
 And here's what's at stake.

1108
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,200
 Like, let's say you're right.

1109
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,360
 It's not poison ivy,

1110
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,280
 even though leaves of three let them be, and we didn't.

1111
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,440
 Let's say you're right.

1112
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,360
 It's not.

1113
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,120
 And we go and we leave five minutes early.

1114
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,560
 We miss five minutes of the trail,

1115
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,920
 and we go wash our hands.

1116
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,800
 What did we miss out on?

1117
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,360
 Just five minutes of the trail,

1118
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,420
 and you know, we got to wash our hands.

1119
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,960
 Let's say I'm right, and it is poison ivy,

1120
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,760
 and he's touching currently all of us,

1121
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,860
 even still right in this moment.

1122
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,720
 What is at stake?

1123
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,440
 All of us are getting poison ivy

1124
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,560
 and going to be incredibly uncomfortable.

1125
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,800
 So anyways, finally, I convince her,

1126
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,680
 we'll get out of there.

1127
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,200
 We go find like the only water source around there,

1128
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,720
 and we begin to just like pour water on our son,

1129
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,480
 who at this point is like pouring on his face,

1130
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,760
 and we're like trying to explain,

1131
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,240
 hey, you're gonna thank us later

1132
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,360
 when we're pouring water on all of us.

1133
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,240
 Now, was it poison ivy?

1134
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,040
 Well, I didn't know until 3 a.m. that night

1135
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,480
 when my wife got up and said,

1136
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,700
 I've got poison ivy all over my leg.

1137
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,320
 And there was apparently, you know,

1138
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,620
 an area where she hadn't rubbed water on,

1139
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,600
 and she was wrong.

1140
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,400
 Even though she thought she was right,

1141
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,920
 she was wrong, and it cost her.

1142
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,280
 And what was at stake was clearly like,

1143
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,820
 hey, we should do this,

1144
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,280
 and I'm glad that we went and washed our hands

1145
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,480
 that five minutes or else our son would have been decked out

1146
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,960
 and our daughter would have been decked out

1147
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,660
 in poison ivy all over their body.

1148
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,440
 And you were wrong, and it cost you.

1149
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,360
 Now, if you're in the room, or if you're listening tonight,

1150
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,300
 or you're listening down the road at some later time,

1151
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,440
 and you hear this message,

1152
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,960
 and you've embraced a worldview that seems to say,

1153
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,980
 I don't think it's true.

1154
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,760
 What the Bible says, I don't think any of that's true.

1155
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,880
 I think God, you know, we all came from nothing.

1156
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,440
 There's no reason that we're here.

1157
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,060
 There isn't a God behind everything.

1158
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,140
 There's no purpose to our life.

1159
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,680
 I die, worms eat me, and I move on.

1160
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,360
 There's no such thing as any of the stuff the Bible says.

1161
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,360
 He didn't come into the world.

1162
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,000
 God didn't show himself and die on a cross

1163
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,360
 and give his life for humanity.

1164
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,040
 I don't think any of that's true.

1165
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,800
 Let's say you're right.

1166
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,860
 What's at stake?

1167
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,140
 Nothing.

1168
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,320
 You're right, you die and you get eaten by worms.

1169
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,260
 You gain nothing, you lose nothing.

1170
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,360
 Let's say you're wrong.

1171
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,660
 Let's say it's true.

1172
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,520
 Let's say there is a God who is there,

1173
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,360
 who came into the world

1174
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,000
 and he made himself known in the person of Jesus.

1175
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,800
 And he went to a cross to pay the punishment

1176
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
 for your sin and my sin and every sin out there

1177
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,560
 so that you wouldn't have to spend eternity apart from God.

1178
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,280
 And he created you with purpose.

1179
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,680
 And he created this world with purpose around it.

1180
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,360
 And he's the one behind the big bang.

1181
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,200
 He's the one who designed everything around you

1182
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,760
 in the world that you see.

1183
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,640
 And he's offered to anyone who will simply accept

1184
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,080
 what he did on the cross on their behalf,

1185
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,000
 dying in their place and rising from the grave

1186
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,240
 so that they would have eternity with him

1187
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,880
 and not be sent to eternity away from him in hell.

1188
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,180
 Let's say you're wrong.

1189
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,040
 What is at stake?

1190
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,560
 You cannot be too certain about this question.

1191
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,000
 The evidence, you need to evaluate it.

1192
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,080
 If there's any part of you that's like,

1193
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,040
 I don't even know that I really want that to be true

1194
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,880
 because then I may have to change.

1195
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,640
 You should be really concerned

1196
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,460
 and be honest enough with yourself to go,

1197
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,640
 there's part of me that doesn't want this to be true.

1198
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,520
 I need to at least, if I'm gonna be objective

1199
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,480
 and evaluate the evidence, acknowledge that.

1200
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,080
 And then begin to go like,

1201
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,920
 does evolution really disprove the Bible?

1202
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,320
 Like if hell is at stake for eternity,

1203
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,020
 you cannot be too certain.

1204
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,320
 What is at stake is far more

1205
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,200
 than some sort of poison ivy rash.

1206
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,760
 And if I'm right, and Jesus,

1207
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,140
 and everything the Bible says about scripture,

1208
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,320
 what is at stake is bigger than anything

1209
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,280
 you could ever imagine and more important

1210
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,000
 than anything you will ever ask yourself.

1211
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,120
 And could it be true?

1212
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,840
 And if there's any part of you that wants to reject that,

1213
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,800
 just 'cause out of your own desire, you should be concerned.

1214
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,220
 Because it relates to the Big Bang.

1215
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,360
 You can reject Christianity for different reasons,

1216
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,440
 but the Big Bang's not one of them.

1217
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,000
 Evolution doesn't disprove it.

1218
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,180
 And science doesn't contradict it.

1219
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,320
 And you need to be asking, could it be?

1220
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,300
 Could it be true?

1221
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,860
 For many of you,

1222
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,000
 that question's gonna take a lot of courage.

1223
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,080
 But wherever you are, I want you to pray tonight,

1224
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,880
 maybe in this moment, and just begin to think,

1225
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,840
 like, God, could it be true?

1226
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
 If you're out there, I wanna know you.

1227
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,160
 I wanna know you more than I wanna know answers.

1228
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,900
 I wanna know you more than I wanna be right.

1229
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,960
 I wanna know you.

1230
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,960
 Will you help me?

1231
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,280
 And that's a prayer our God loves to answer.

1232
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,160
 Let me pray.

1233
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,360
 Father, thank you that you

1234
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,520
 are not a God who we have to wonder what he is like.

1235
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,840
 You wove together the world around us,

1236
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,960
 you created everything that is,

1237
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,360
 you placed us inside of it.

1238
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,880
 And then so that we would know who you are

1239
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
 and what you're like,

1240
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:51,160
 you entered into it, you became like one of us,

1241
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,320
 so that we could relate to you and we could know you,

1242
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,120
 and you did so in the form of Jesus.

1243
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,440
 And thank you that you didn't come into this world

1244
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
 and say, everyone has rebelled

1245
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,680
 and everyone's gonna be punished.

1246
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,280
 You came into the world, you created, you formed,

1247
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,800
 the atoms you held together,

1248
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,000
 the world you spoke into existence,

1249
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,520
 and you bore the punishment for all of our sin,

1250
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,120
 that you came running after us, even though we ran from you.

1251
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,480
 I pray for right now, anyone listening to this,

1252
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,600
 that you would do what only you can do,

1253
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,840
 which is reveal yourself and reveal the truth

1254
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,000
 about who you are.

1255
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,200
 They would begin to doubt their doubts and question,

1256
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
 could it be that it's true?

1257
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,720
 I pray that if nothing else,

1258
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,240
 the question of what is at stake and how much is at stake

1259
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,760
 would penetrate into hearts and minds,

1260
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,040
 and your spirit would allow those of us

1261
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,640
 who've never had a moment of faith

1262
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,680
 to come to trust in what you did on the cross.

1263
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,720
 You died in our place, you took the punishment we deserved,

1264
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,080
 and you rose from dead.

1265
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,200
 And we will be with you for all of eternity.

1266
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,960
 And we worship you now in song, amen.
