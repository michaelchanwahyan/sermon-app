[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Music]
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Well, what's up Porch? How we doing tonight?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Hey, it's such a joy. It's so good to be back at the Porch.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   If we've never met before, my name is Timothy Atik
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   and I'm one of the pastors here at Watermark.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I want to give a huge shout out to all of the Porch Live locations watching tonight.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Hope all is well with you.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   I know we've got counselors from Pine Cove in the city here with us.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Welcome. So glad that you made it.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We are about to jump into a very important topic.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Tonight we are just focusing on the topic of pornography.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   You don't know whether to cheer or not.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   You're like, "If I cheer, does that mean I'm into it?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   If I don't cheer, I don't know what to do."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   So, the best thing to do is to just pray.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Alright, everyone bow their heads and just close their eyes.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So we can avoid an awkward moment looking at each other.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So, hey, seriously, this is a really important part of my story
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   that I'm looking forward to sharing with you about.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   But I know that pornography is a part of many people's journeys right now.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And so I just want to invite you to pray.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And just say, "God, would you speak to me tonight clearly?"
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And then would you pray for the other people in this room and around you?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Just pray that God would speak clearly to them.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And then would you pray for me?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And would you pray that God would use me tonight in your lives?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Well, Lord, I pray that you would have your way with us tonight.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I pray that there would not be one person in this room that leaves tonight
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   without having had an encounter with you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I pray that you would speak clearly to our hearts tonight.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   May our ears be open and may our hearts be receptive to anything
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   and everything that you would want to say.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Well, the summer between my eighth grade year and my freshman year in high school,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   my dad and I, we were flying to Indianapolis to go to the Indy 500 race.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   And on our way back to Dallas, we were in the Indianapolis airport,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and I stumbled upon an inappropriate magazine.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I don't know what caused me to do it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Probably it was because I was an almost freshman in high school pubescent kid,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   and I picked up this magazine without my dad knowing,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and I hid it in my stuff, and I took it home with me.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And I didn't realize that that one decision was the beginning
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   of what would be a seven-year intense battle with pornography.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Pornography became a very, very defining part of my story for the next seven years.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And when I think back upon my intense battle with pornography,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   there were various things that marked that struggle.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   The first was that I just believed that everyone struggled with porn.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Like, there was this statistic that people would float around
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   that 98% of guys look at porn, and the other 2% are just lying about it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   That's what all the guys would tell themselves.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And so I just viewed myself as a stereotypical college guy
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   because everyone looks at porn.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Another thing that defined me was just a consistent appetite for more.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   What I would find is that there was certain images that would lose their effect,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and I would just want more.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I would want the material to be more explicit or more intense.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   There was just an insatiable growing appetite for more.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then on top of that, there was the feeling of being a failure
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   because I was a Christian, and people knew me as a good Christian guy,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and yet so often throughout the week I was looking at pornography,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and so I felt like a hypocrite.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And so I would go through this cycle of promising God I'm done with that,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and then I might have a good few days or a good few weeks,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   and then eventually I would just relapse back into pornography.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And then finally, something that marked my struggle with pornography
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   was a desire to be done with it, but this fear that I never would be.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   This desire, this hope that I would be done with it,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   partnered with this fear that I never would be done with it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And so I share that with you just to say,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I don't know if that feels a little bit like your journey.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I don't know if you can identify with that at all.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But if so, I just want you to know there is hope,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and the reason that I can say that is because I'm living it.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   The summer before my senior year in college,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   God intervened in my life in a very clear and miraculous and supernatural way,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and the power of the gospel began to go to work on my heart,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and what God did, it wasn't an overnight thing,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   but what He did was He set me on a path toward healing.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And for the last 19 years of my life,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   the Lord has led me in freedom from pornography.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And so I tell you that to say, I stand up here as someone who can say,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   look, there is hope, because I've been in a place where I felt like there was no hope.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And so now I stand up here, and I've shared my story,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   my journey with pornography with thousands of people,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and the reason that I share it is because I don't have a story to hide,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I have a story to tell.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   My battle with pornography, it's not this anchor of shame
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   that I have to tow through my life.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's a trophy of God's grace because God intervened.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   He showed up, He moved, and it was solely because of His grace in my life
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and His power at work through me in the mighty name of Jesus to break me free.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And so the reason that I wanted to step in and talk about this tonight
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   is to kind of piggyback off of what Kylan was talking about last week.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Y'all walked through Colossians chapter 3 in this amazing series, "Above All,"
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and I don't know if you remember last week, but in Colossians chapter 3,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   the conversation was about putting off and putting on.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   There's the old and the new self, and there were certain things
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   that the Apostle Paul said that we should put to death.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Just to remind you, in Colossians chapter 3, verse 5, Paul says this.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I'm going to back up. He says in verse 5,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   which is idolatry."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   What you need to know is all of those terms are sexual in nature.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   So Paul is looking at us saying, "You just need to put it to death."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And so the reason that I want to talk about pornography is because
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   pastor and author James Emery White, here's what he said.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "Pornography may be the greatest area of immorality
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   inflicted on and pursued by generation Z."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Do you hear what he's saying? He's speaking about your generation,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and he's saying pornography is quite possibly the greatest source
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   of sin among your generation.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It's the greatest source of sin inflicted upon you.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   What he's saying is, "I sympathize with you.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   You live in a day where it is more difficult to walk in freedom
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   from pornography than any point in history.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's inflicted upon you, but it's also pursued by you."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And so I care deeply about your generation knowing that there is hope,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   so much so that when I did a doctoral program,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I devoted all of my studies to pornography
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and fighting for freedom among your generation.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And so what I want to do is I just want to help you take a step towards hope.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   If you're here tonight and you are in the midst of the battle,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   what I want you to feel is hope.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   If you're looking in the rearview mirror and pornography was a thing of your past,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   what I want you to feel is gratitude.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And if you're here tonight and you're like, "Who struggles with pornography?"
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   What I want you to feel is a wake-up call,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   that it's a part of people's stories all around you,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   and God might want to use you to be a source of hope and healing for your friends.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So there's three things that I really want to address tonight.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I want to address the reality of porn, the results of porn, and the remedy for porn.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And I'm just going to warn you up front the way that this talk is going to feel
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   because it's not going to feel like a normal message.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The first half of it is going to feel very research-based.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   It's going to be a lot of facts and figures and quotes,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   but it's good for us to deal with the information.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And then we're just going to spend the second half of the message
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   really diving into the Scriptures, looking at the remedy for porn
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   so that you can leave here knowing that there is hope.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Okay, you guys with me tonight?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I'll take it, all right.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Let's start by talking about the reality of porn.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And I'm going to share some things with you that are so obvious,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   but it might just be helpful for you to hear it anyway.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   When I talk about the reality of porn, we just have to start with the fact
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   that porn is more accessible and acceptable than ever.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Think about it. It's more accessible than ever.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Do you know when pornography started?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   It started in the 1950s through Playboy,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   which was this magazine for middle- to upper-class white men.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It started in print. Like, you had to go to a store to buy it.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And then in the 1980s, pornography made its way to film,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   but again, you had to get up the courage to go to a video store
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   to rent a pornographic film, take it up to the counter, and check it out.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Then in the early 2000s, pornography began to flourish on the Internet,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   but even then, like, you had to do explicit searches
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   specifically for pornographic websites, and then when you went to them,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   you would have to pay money for them.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   But now, think about it. Porn exists on 12% of all websites in the world.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   12% of them. It's on social media, it's in random text messages that you receive,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   and it's on every streaming platform in the most popular shows of our day.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's more accessible than ever.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Like Pornhub, one of the largest pornographic websites in our world,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   they publish a data report on their website every single year.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   This is a stat all the way back from 2019, but just think about this.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   In 2019 alone, 6.83 million new videos were uploaded.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And they just wanted to give us an idea of how much new content that was.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Here's what they said.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If you strung all of 2019's new video content together and started watching them
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   all the way back in 1850, you'd still be watching them today.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's just from one year of uploads on one site.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   My point in telling you that is that it is more accessible than ever,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and what Pornhub reported is that 93% of the visits to their website
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   were accessed by a phone, and we all have phones.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Here's what I'm telling you, and this might feel a little bit dramatic to you,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   but it's just reality.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Every single one of us is carrying around pornography in our pockets
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   every single day all day.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   When I was battling pornography, there had to be this intentional effort
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   of going to your desktop computer to access it.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Now it's just simply something that you access.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   You don't even have to access it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   It will just find you through your social media.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It's just reality.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's more accessible than ever, but that accessibility is combined
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   within acceptability.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Like one study found that your generation views not recycling as more immoral
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   than looking at porn.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   That interesting?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Not recycling is more immoral than looking at pornography.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   96% of young adults are either encouraging, accepting, or neutral
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   when they talk about porn with their friends.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   So just think about where you're at with that.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Are you one of those people who are like, "You better recycle"?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Looking at porn, it's up to you, but you better recycle.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Like I'm checking to see if that blue bag is out every single Tuesday.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   What is it for you? Where are you at with it?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   When you talk about porn with your friends, when you joke about it,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   do you joke about it in a positive light or a neutral at worst?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   We live--the reality is we live in a pornified world.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   What I mean by that is we just live in a world where it has become
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   so normalized.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   I remember watching the TV show Friends.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   What a classic.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Like I don't know how many of you all have gone back and binge-watched Friends,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   but even on Friends in the '90s, porn was like--it was just a part of their lives.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Like there's the episode where Joey and Chandler get free porn,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and it's just like a part of their day.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   They're like, "We need to turn it off," and the minute they turn it off,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   they're like, "Let's turn it back on to make sure we still have free porn."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   It's just normalized.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Pornhub totaled 2.14 billion visits during a single month in 2023,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   which was more than Instagram, Netflix, Pinterest, and TikTok all combined.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So let's just state what it is.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Like porn is more accessible and acceptable than ever before.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   That's just reality.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Now I know I'm not telling you anything that you don't know,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   so let's just keep moving.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Here's more reality about porn.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's not just a guy problem.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Porn is a--it's a people--it's a people problem.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   One study found that 57% of young adults seek porn out at least once a month.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   For so long, pornography was considered just a guy problem.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   But one survey of 3,000 women found that 31% of those 3,000 reported weekly porn use.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   30% indicated viewing porn a few times a month.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And I say that just to say, "Hey, you might be a woman in this room struggling with pornography,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   and you feel even more shame because you think you're probably the only one because it's a guy problem."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And I just want to tell you it is not.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Like the first time I spoke on pornography was back in 2017.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   The reason that I spoke on it is I sat with a group of college students,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and I asked them, "Hey, what do you want me to speak on?"
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Two of the ten people in the room, two girls and one guy said pornography.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It's because women have been increasingly more prone to struggling with pornography.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   I remember when I did speak on it, there were girls in the crowd who were like,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   "Who struggles with pornography?"
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And what's crazy is that there was so many good, sweet Christian girls who were like,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   "I'm struggling with pornography."
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And so what's happened is that guys feel the freedom to be like,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   "Yeah, I've been struggling with it. I need some help."
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And then girls feel like they've got to struggle over here alone
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   because it's just not something girls struggle with.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And I just want to tell you it absolutely is.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And this needs to be a safe place for you to come and just say, "Look, I need help. I need help."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   The next thing that I want you to realize about the reality of porn is this.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   This is very important.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   The porn industry is seeking lifetime customers.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Do you realize that?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The porn industry, the porn and sex tech industries are working to make you a lifetime customer
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   because I want you to understand the mission of the porn industry.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The mission of the porn industry is to convince you that sex virtually or sex in a fantasy world
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   is so much better than sex in the real world.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   That's what they want to convince you of is that fantasy is better than reality.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Here's what Pornhub Insights, their end-of-year report says.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Listen to this. This is so interesting.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   They say users looking for a more realistic porn viewing experience could tune in and unzip
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   getting everything they needed without all the real-world troubles.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Who needs an in-real-life partner when you have point-of-view Pornhub videos on your side?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Do you see what they're saying?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   They're saying, "Look, sex in a fantasy world is just so much better. It's so much easier.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   It's so much more customized. You can connect it with haptic technology
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   that just makes it a better experience."
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   What the porn industry has going for it is that there's so many people in our culture
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   who are just rationalizing the benefits of porn.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   For example, a men's health article states that surges in testosterone caused by erotic films
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   can improve your squat strength at the gym.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Who knew?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Or a woman with the Sexual Wellness Center, here's what she explains.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   She explains, "Women are increasingly viewing porn,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   which hopefully means they are engaging in some self-pleasuring."
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   This is good news because it indicates that women are taking charge of their sexuality,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   discovering their bodies and identifying what they like.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Less shame, less taboo around female sexuality equals more exploration.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   See the rationalization?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   But in addition to rationalization, there's innovation.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   So I want you to just think about the development of porn in terms of the five senses.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   So the way pornography started out in the 1950s was just through sight.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And then in the 1980s when it moved to film, it combined sight and sound.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But now we're moving into a day and age where there is Bluetooth technology
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   that introduces sight, sound, and touch.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And so what's interesting is, you know, in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   if someone wanted to get rid of porn, it was like, "Dude, you just need to throw out your magazines."
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   In the 1980s and '90s, it was, "Stop going to blockbuster video."
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   In the early 2000s, it was, "Dude, get rid of your Ethernet cable."
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   I know I'm saying things that you're like, "I don't even know what he's talking about right now."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   An Ethernet cable was a cable that connected your huge desktop computer to the wall, to the Internet.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But now we're in a day and time where we are moving closer to,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   "Hey, dude, you need to get rid of your haptic technology, like your haptic suit."
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And in a matter of years, it's going to be like, "Dude, you've got to give up the sex robot.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Like, let's just get real. It's time to get rid of it."
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And we can think, "Dude, that's crazy. That's not where we're headed."
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It most certainly is.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Why?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Because you have an industry that is trying to replace real-life experience.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And so what they've done is they've taken deepfake technology,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   so that now if you have enough images of anyone,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   person you sat next to at Starbucks, person that works next to you,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   someone you see at the gym, if you have enough pictures of them,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   you can dump them into a program, and they'll take that person's--
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   they'll analyze their facial features, combine it with a porn star's body,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   and you can be with whoever you want.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Talk about a violation of your being.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   But listen to what one guy in the sex tick industry says.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   He says, "We are rapidly approaching a point where man and machine merge,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   where sex can be better and safer outside of real life."
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   So I just tell you that, and some of you are like,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   "This is not what I expected from the porch.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   You got invited, and you're like, 'Don't call me next Tuesday.'"
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I can tell you from right now, it's a hard pass for me.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So good news, we're going to be back in Colossians next week.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I won't be here next Tuesday. Kylan will be back.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   You should totally come back next Tuesday.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   But while I'm here, I'm going to keep moving forward, okay?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   That's the reality of porn.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Let's talk about the results of porn.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Here are some results of porn.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   One is it cultivates unrealistic expectations.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   It cultivates unrealistic expectations.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   What's interesting is if you struggle with porn,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   just think about how old were you when you were first introduced to porn.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   The average age is somewhere between the ages of 8 and 13.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   You know what that means?
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It means that you were introduced to porn before you actually got sex ed
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   from the public school system.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   And so often, whoever tells us something first becomes the authority.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And so, so many of us grow up thinking that sex is what we have learned through porn.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   It's like a stand-in sex ed force.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   So we step into marriage thinking that sex is what we've seen in porn,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   or not even marriage.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Like if you enter into--if you're sexually active in your dating relationship,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   there's a good chance that you expect for your sexual experience
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   to mimic what you've seen in porn.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   So sex, then, it's all about you.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It's what you like.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It's what feels good to you.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   It's about your orgasm.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Porn leads you to believe that your spouse exists to meet your sexual needs.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   What's so interesting is I was doing my research,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   and I came across this quote from a porn star.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Listen to what she says.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Some of you are going to be like, "I don't even want to know this."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Here's what she says.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   She says, "Porn actors spend hours in the same position to get the shot.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   You're sore after hours of filming.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Being on set, it's hot.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Your makeup runs, and you get sweaty fast.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   You work long days and long hours filming to create a 15-minute clip of pure perfection."
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Do you see what she's saying?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   She's saying none of it's real.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   We spend hours and even days to then splice together 15 minutes
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   to create this experience which convinces a generation
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   that fantasy is better than reality.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You know what?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   People in your generation, y'all are dating less.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   You're getting married less.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   You're waiting longer.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Why?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Because so many people in your generation are at home connecting virtually with fantasy.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   It cultivates unrealistic expectations.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Second, it normalizes perverted desires.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   What it does is it convinces you that perverted desires are actually normal.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   There's a rule on the internet.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   It's this unofficial rule, Rule 34, which states that if it exists, there's porn of it, no exceptions.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   What they're saying is, "Hey, if you can dream it, if you can think of it,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   there's probably already porn of it."
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   So you know what? There's a reason why when you start looking at porn,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   your appetite grows, your desire for things that are more novel, more intense, more extreme.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It just begins--it's like a snowball moving down a hill.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   It just grows bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Why? Because you have all these videos that are just saying,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   "Yeah, that fantasy that you had, that's actually normal.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   There's actually already a video that exists of it."
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And so the searches that people are making,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   like which is so interesting that one of the top searches on Pornhub
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   was for cartoon characters that feature cartoons that have both adult features
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and children features.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And what it's doing is it's just normalizing this perversion
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   for people to want something that is not real.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Next, it strains and even ruins relationships.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   I have seen marriages dissolve because of pornography.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Studies show that porn use can increase sexual dissatisfaction.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   It increases self-consciousness in women about body image,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   and it increases the probability of divorce.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Some medical professionals have concluded that some people are--
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   some men are experiencing porn-induced erectile dysfunction,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   which is--it's this kind of desensitization of men
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   that they can only reach the point of feeling stimulated
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   when sex is like it is on a movie.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Next, it hinders intimacy with God because the reality is
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   that it's hard to just be swimming in sin and intimate with Jesus at the same time.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   And if you've convinced yourself that you're close to God
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   when you're very close to porn, you can't be close to both at the same time.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   It also hinders impact.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   One of the things that led to a change in my journey with porn
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   is I just remember the church that I was attending and serving at,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I applied to be a Bible study leader, and on the application,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   they asked, "Do you struggle with pornography?"
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And I was like, "Of course I do, just like 98% of the other dudes,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   and the other 2%, you should just ask them about their lives."
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And then I remember this guy calling me and just saying,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   "TA, we've got to talk about this,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   because it's going to be hard for you to lead a group of guys
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   in studying God's Word when you're struggling with this."
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   And that was a wake-up call that, you know what?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Sin impacts your ministry.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   So those are the results of porn.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   So let's shift gears now to the remedy for porn.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Like, what is the remedy for porn?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Well, at the foundational level, I want to use John 8:32 as the foundation.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   What does it say? Jesus says this. He says,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   "You will know the truth, and the truth will," what?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   "Set you free."
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "You'll know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   And so what I want to do is I'm going to rifle through these things right now.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And it's going to feel like a lot.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   You might need to take notes the best you can,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and then go back and listen to the message again.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   But there are several things that I want you to know
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   that are going to help provide the remedy for your struggle with porn.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And so let me just begin to roll through these.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   One, you need to know God's will.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And what's great is that Scripture spells it out.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Listen to what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 3.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   He says, "For this is the will of God."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   So I know that many of you here, because you're young adults,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   there's this wrestle right now with God's will for your life.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Like, "God, who do you want me to marry?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   God, what do you want me to do with my life?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   God, where do you want me to work?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Am I in the right job right now?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Do you even want me living in Dallas?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Is Watermark where you want me coming to church?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Who are my friends going to be?"
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   And it's all of this wrestle with God.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   "What's your will for my life?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I need you to open up the heavens and speak audibly
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   and just tell me. Is it him? Is it her?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   When's this going to happen?"
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And we can be so consumed with God's unrevealed will
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   that we completely ignore His revealed will.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   So just listen to what God spells out for us.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   "For this is the will of God, your sanctification."
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   We'll unpack that in a minute.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   "That you do what? That you abstain from sexual immorality."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   That word "sexual immorality" in the Greek,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   it's the Greek word "porneia,"
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   which is where we get pornography from.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   "This is the will of God, your sanctification."
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   What does "sanctification" mean?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   It means to be set apart.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Listen to how this theologian explained sanctification.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   He says, "By sanctification is meant
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   the continued transformation of moral and spiritual character
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   so that the believer's life actually comes to mirror
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   the standing he or she already has in God's sight."
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   So let's hear this.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   So let me say this.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   everything I'm talking about right now
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   comes with the assumption that you have already come to a place
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   where you have realized that in God's eyes,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   without a relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   you are, according to the Bible, spiritually dead.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   It's not that you're spiritually bad.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   It's not that you're spiritually sick
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and so you just need to do better and be better
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and try harder and come to church more.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   No, the Bible says that you are spiritually dead.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   What does that mean?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   It means that you are incapable of doing anything
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   pleasing to God on your own.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   And the incredible news is that when you could do nothing,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   God did everything, that God in his overwhelming love for you
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   sent his Son Christ, that the eternal Son of God
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   left heaven and put on flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Jesus Christ lived the perfect life you and I could never live.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   He was crucified. He died gruesomely.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   He rose victoriously, conquering all of your sin and all of my sin,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   so that when you put your trust in him,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   he actually puts his Spirit in you.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   God actually lives inside of you,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   and he begins to lead you, and he makes you new.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And so that's where we have to start.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   When Miller to Erickson is talking about sanctification,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   what he's saying is, "Look, if you know Jesus Christ,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   if you've surrendered your life to Jesus Christ,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   then Christ has made you completely holy and pure in God's eyes."
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Which is amazing that positionally before God,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   you're not filthy, dirty, packed full of wretched sin.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   No, in God's eyes, you're actually clean and pure and holy.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   But when Paul says that the will of God is sanctification for your life,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   what he's saying is, "God's will is that we would be
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   practically what we already are positionally."
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So if positionally in God's eyes, we are pure and holy and clean,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   then God's will is that practically we would begin to live
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   pure and holy and clean lives.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   That's God's will.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   The second thing that you need to know is this,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   know God's standard.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   So we've established that God's will for you is to abstain from porneia.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Like, that's spelled out for you.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   If you have any question in you, God made it clear.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   But like, how serious is God about it?
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   What I love is that the Bible doesn't leave us guessing.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Like, it's not like, "Well, man, I'm just not like going to Pornhub.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   I'm just like, I'm on Instagram just looking at people's random accounts."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   It's technically not porn.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Well, listen to what God clarifies in Ephesians 5, verse 3.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   He says, "But among you there must not even be a hint of sexual immorality
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   or of any kind of impurity or of greed."
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Why?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Because these are improper for who?
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   For God's holy people.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   He's saying, "Look, because God has made you new and holy,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   it just doesn't make sense for you."
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   He's saying, "Not even a hint."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I was trying to think, like, what are things that have just hints in them?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Well, Tostitos has chips that have a hint of lime.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You're like, "Oh, man, it's a regular Tostito."
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   No, it's not.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   There's that hint of lime.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Or there's like sparkling water where you're like, "It's just a plain Topo Chico."
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   And then it's like, "No, it's the one that has the lime in it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's got that hint."
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   It's like you barely even notice it, but it's there.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Paul is saying, "Hey, not even like the hint of it.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   It's not like, it's just like it's Instagram."
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   No, he's like, "No, not even a hint."
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   And it's so interesting the clarity he gives.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   He says, "There shouldn't even be a hint of pornea
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   or of any kind of impurity."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   In the Greek, it's the idea of lustful living.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   But then the one that I really appreciate is he says,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   "Or any kind of impurity or of greed."
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   So it's kind of like, what is Paul ADD?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   He's like, "Hey, man, no sex and greed."
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Let's talk about money.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   It's like, no, that greed he's talking about there, it's a sexual greed.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   It's the idea that you believe other people exist for your own gratification.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   So he's like, "Yeah, when you're at the gym and you see her or you see him
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   and you just begin to fantasize like they're not an actual being,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   they actually just exist for your fantasy world."
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   He's like, "No, no, no, no, that's a type of greed
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   that just doesn't match who you are."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   As God's holy people, know God's standard.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Number three, know God's commands.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Like what does God actually command in the Bible?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   I love this because God spells it out for us.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Like he doesn't toss us the keys to our sexuality and say,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   "I don't know, it's 2024, what do you think?"
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   No, he's like, "Let me just spell it out for you.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Know my will. What's my will for your life?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Sanctification, abstain.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   What's my standard? Not even a hint.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   What are my commands? 1 Corinthians 6.18, flee from sexual immorality.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Flee, like run away.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   It's like you see and you're like, "Nope," and you're out.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Flee from it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   In the verb tense in the Greek, it means that you make it your habit to flee.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Flee from sexual immorality, but then y'all talked about it last week,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Colossians 5, put it to death.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Put it to death.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   It's the idea of like cutting off the supply lines.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   When I thought about this, any Stranger Things fans in here?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Like a few.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I don't know what you're doing with your life.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Anyway, I love Stranger Things.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I don't know if that's okay to say, but I really enjoy it.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I want you to think about Dart.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   You remember Dartanian, Dusty's pet?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   He finds Dart.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   When Dart is just like this small little thing, what does Dusty do?
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   He wants to make it his pet.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   When he takes it home, he hides it under his hat.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   He doesn't tell any of his friends about it.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Why?
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Because he thinks that Dart is just this cute little friend that he's connected with over at Candy Bar.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Then what does Dart do?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   He murders his cat.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   That's a problem.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   The thing that he was feeding Candy Bar to fed on his cat.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   In the end, the thing that Dusty had made his pet had to die.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   How did Dart die?
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   From closing the gate.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   If you haven't seen the show, you'll just have to believe.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   You had to close the gate to the upside down where all of the power was coming from.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   You had to close it.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   You had to cut off the supply line.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   You can't make porn your pet.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   It's like, "You know what? I'm just going to stick it in the aquarium.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   It's contained.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   It's not a problem.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I can watch all of the shows that are popular right now on Netflix where there's a plethora of sexual scenes.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   It's not a problem.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I'm just watching this because everyone's talking about it.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   I can sit there and scroll endlessly on Instagram.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Even though Instagram knows what you want to see, has your algorithm down, begins to consistently make suggestions.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   How about a bout with porn?
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   How's that sound right now? 5 p.m.? How about some porn?
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   10 p.m.? Porn sound good?
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   You have to cut off the supply lines.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Know God's standards.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Are you willing to forsake comfort and convenience for the sake of freedom?
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Next, know God's enabled capacity.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Know God's enabled capacity.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Because if you hear me say, "Know God's will, know God's standards, know God's commands,"
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   you might be like, "I know them. I know them, and I'm still feeling."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   "TA, you're just making me feel like more of a failure."
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   This is where you have to understand how the gospel works in your life.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Know God's enabled capacity.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Last week, y'all talked about the old self and the new self.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   It's like wearing clothes.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   When you're wearing the old self, Bruce Demarest, a theologian, he puts it this way.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   He says, "The old nature is the capacity to serve Satan, sin, and self acquired through Adam,
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   whereas the new nature is the capacity to serve God and righteousness acquired through the new birth."
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   So let's just be clear.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   You need to understand who you are because of Christ.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   Because of what Christ has done, you are completely new,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   which means you have a completely new capacity.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Without Christ, you only have one capacity,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and that capacity is to serve Satan, sin, and self.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   If you struggle with porn, you're well acquainted with that capacity.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   You're like, "I know my capacity to not want to look at porn ever again,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   and then an hour later, I'm looking at porn."
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   You know your capacity really well that, "You know what? Today, I'm going to be strong."
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And then you're scrolling, and it's like, "I'll be strong tomorrow, but tonight I can't be strong."
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   But Christ is saying, "Look, you--the biggest lie you can believe
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   is that I've saved you, but I haven't changed you."
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And what a lie from the pit of hell that Christ has saved you, but he hasn't changed you.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   The reality is he has made you new, and he sent his spirit.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   God himself lives inside of you, which means you have a new capacity to serve God.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   The theologian Douglas Moo, he says this, he says, "You have been brought into the sphere of God's power."
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Listen to what Paul says in Ephesians 1:18. Don't miss this.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   He says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened."
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   You know what he's saying? He's saying, "Look, I just want you to see reality."
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Like, if you know Jesus, open your eyes.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   See the truth about you.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   the riches of his glorious inheritance and his holy people."
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Watch this. "And his incomparably great power." For who? For us who believe.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   What kind of power is it? Don't miss this.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   "That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   and seated him at the right hand in the heavenly realms."
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   Do you understand what that's saying?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   It's saying that the same power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead actually lives inside of you.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Like, do you realize that?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   So, if you're sitting there saying, "I have no hope. There's no way I'll ever be done with porn."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   To say there is no hope is to say that God himself is powerless over your sin.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Know your God-enabled capacity.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Next, know your God-given identity.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Know your God-given identity.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Do you know what my problem was for so long?
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I was a follower of Jesus Christ, and yet I was operating as a stereotypical college guy.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Everyone struggles with porn.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   But that's not the truest thing about you.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   If you know Jesus Christ, you're a child of God.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Listen to what Paul says in Ephesians 5.1. He says, "Therefore, be imitators of God."
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   If we only stop there, then we're like, "Oh, here we go. Thanks for making me feel like a failure.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   How do I imitate God? It's impossible."
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   He says, "Therefore, be imitators of God." How?
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   As beloved children.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Your identity should determine your activity.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   I love what Louis Giglio said.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   He said, "Be imitators of God as beloved children."
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   If you break down that word "beloved," what two words does it form?
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Be loved.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   You know why so many of us run to porn?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   It's because we're trying to fill a void of love.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Like, we feel undesirable, unlovable.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   We feel insecure, and so it's just safer.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   It's easier. It pacifies a gnawing pain in our souls.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   That Jesus desperately wants to satisfy.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   If you want to just take a step with porn and freedom from it,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   then start allowing yourself to be loved by God.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   As His child.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   We're His children.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And then listen to what Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6, 19-20.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   He says, "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   whom you have from God? You're not your own.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   You've been bought with the price of glorified God in your body."
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Do you know what Paul's saying? He's saying, "You know what?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Your body, when you put your trust in Christ,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   do you know what it became? It became a temple of the Holy Spirit."
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   That word in the Greek, it means that your body is a sacred shrine,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   a sanctuary, or the place where deity dwells.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   So you're not just a stereotypical guy or a stereotypical young adult woman.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   You're a child of God, but you're the temple of God.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   So when you begin to acclimate to your real identity,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   it's like, "Look, no, no, no. I'm a child of God.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   God, how do you want me to interact with porn as your child?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Is this what your children do?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   If I'm your house, if you live in me, is this what we want in your house?
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   If I'm your sacred shrine, your sanctuary where you dwell,
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   is this what we want to be looking at?"
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   It changes your activity.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   And then finally, know your strategy.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Know your strategy.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I would encourage everyone to answer these three questions.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Here they are.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   What do you need to start? What do you need to stop?
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   And who can help?
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Someone set their alarm, they're like, "He should be done by now.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Like, if he's not done by now, I'm going to set my alarm
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   and tell him it's time to land that plane, bro.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Heard, heard.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   Heard, chef, okay."
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Know your strategy.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Let me just rattle off a few things.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   What do you need to start?
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Let me encourage you, start memorizing Scripture.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   David says this in Psalm 119--or the author of Psalm 119 says,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   "How can a young man keep his way pure?
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   By guarding it according to your word."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   When I was making my way out of porn, I slept on a loft bed.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   If that doesn't remind you of college, I don't know what will,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   but I was sleeping on a loft, and I just wrote all these Scriptures
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   on note cards, and I taped them above my head,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   so that at night I was just going to bed, meditating on God's Word.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And when I woke up in the morning, I was just meditating on God's Word.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   And by the power of His Spirit, it began to transform me.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Begin to memorize Scripture.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Second, something you might need to start is you might need to start quitting every day.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Don't quit porn for a lifetime.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   It's too big of a declaration.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   Quit every day.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Wake up and say, "God, today, today, today,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   would you let me go 24 hours without sinning against you with pornography?"
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   I would wake up every morning and just say, "God, today,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I'm just one step away from looking at porn.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   God, would you fill me with your Spirit?
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   Would your standard for purity be my purity?
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And when I'm tempted, would you help me to take the way of escape?"
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Quit every day.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   Number three, rehearse your identity.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Wake up every morning and say, "God, look, I'm a child.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   I don't want to act like a stereotypical woman, stereotypical male.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   When I'm your child, help me to live like your child."
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Pray constantly.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   Set an alarm to go off every 30 minutes.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   That was an example earlier.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   But set an alarm, and each time it goes off, just pray.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   Say, "God, I'm your child.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Help me to live like your child right now for the next 30 minutes.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Would you empower me with the same power that raised Christ from the dead?"
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Next, dignify and humanize those you are tempted by.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I mean, when you're scrolling on Instagram and you see someone that you just want to camp out on,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   start praying for them.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Think about their story.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   That's someone's son or someone's daughter.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   That person is someone that needs the gospel just as much as you need them.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Who knows what their story is in life?
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Who knows what brokenness they have in their own life that only Jesus can satisfy?
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Start praying for them.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Dignify them.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Humanize them.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   They're a real person.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   Get help from friends to lock your phone down.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Like, dumb your phone down.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Make it as unsmart as possible.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   And then I'd encourage you to rehearse the consequences.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   This might blow your mind, but after 19 years of being free from porn,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   I still get tempted to look at porn.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Like, the other day I was going to be in a hotel room by myself,
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   and I was like, "Man, it'd be so nice to look at porn tonight."
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   It's been 19 years, and I thought, "Man, it'd be so nice to look at porn tonight."
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   But now the conversation in my head is, "That's not even an option.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   It's not even an option."
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   If I look at porn, I'm going to feel like a failure because God has done so much for me.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   That'd be a rejection of His love.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   I'm going to have to tell my wife that this is what I chose to do when I'm away from her.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   I'm going to have to tell my kids that this is what their dad was doing when dad was away from you guys.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   I'm going to have to come to church and tell elders here, like,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   "Hey, let me just tell you, you can't trust me when I travel."
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   So one of the things you can do is just rehearse the consequences.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   You know what you're going to realize?
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   It's just not worth it.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   Just look at the backside of porn.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Just look at the backside.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Just walk around and look at the backside of that 15 minutes of looking, that orgasm,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   and then reality comes into view.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   It's like, "Well, there we go. Starting over again."
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Just rehearse the consequences.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   What do you need to stop?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   You might need to stop looking at social media.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Some of you are like, "No, please, not that."
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   Your phone knows what you want to see.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Stop streaming ranch of shows.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Get rid of those streaming services altogether.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Make more time for reading, exercising, and being with godly friends.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   I promise you, you'll experience more life and joy and energy.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   And then who can help?
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   Answer that question, who can help?
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   If you're like, "I don't have anyone to help."
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   Monday nights, regeneration.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Right here in this room, 630.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Regeneration.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   It is for people just like you and me,
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   who are trying to pursue freedom from all different things in life.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   We'd love to have you here.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Commit to walking in the light with a couple of friends.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   Text some friends before you leave tonight.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   If you're here with some friends, just be honest with them.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Say, "Look, I need your help."
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   But answer those three questions.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   What do you need to stop?
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   What do you need to start?
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   And who can help?
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   Now I'll just close by saying,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   "Look, maybe for some of you, the place to start is just by surrendering your life to Jesus."
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Maybe you're sitting there saying,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   "Look, you're telling me that even after struggling with porn for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   God would still want me to be his child?
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Absolutely.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   You're telling me after I've spent all this time using my body to look at porn,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   to masturbate to porn,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   you're telling me that God would even think about coming to live inside of me?
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Absolutely.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Because that's what a good God does.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   The God of heaven and earth looked upon us.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   And in his love,
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   he sent his Son.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   And Jesus Christ has come to rescue you and me,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   to free you and me.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   So that we could move from free porn to being porn free.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   So that we could have hope.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   So that we could have peace.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   So that we could have joy.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   So that we could find our deepest satisfaction in the one that we were made for, Jesus Christ.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   If that's you tonight,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   maybe God brought you here to hear a talk on the most random topic in your mind,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   and yet he brought you here to just say,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   "Look, tonight you're going to be mine.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   I want you in my family.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   I want you to be my child.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   I want you to experience all of my love, all of my forgiveness tonight."
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   And so,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   look, I know I've gone long tonight,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   but I'm going to ask you to engage in this moment for a minute.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   If you're here tonight, and look, I'm not trying to tweak emotions.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I don't want anyone doing anything that isn't real right now.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   This is just an opportunity for those who are sitting there like,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   "God's doing something in my life."
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   If you're here tonight,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   and you just sense that God is just saying,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   "Tonight you're going to be mine.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   Tonight I want you to give your life to me."
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   God is inviting you to put your trust in him,
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   to receive Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Just with your eyes closed, would you slip up your hand tonight
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   so I know exactly who I'm talking to in this place tonight?
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Okay, if that's you, then let me just ask you,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   right now, to tell God what you believe to be true.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   You just say, "God, I believe that you sent Jesus to die for me.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   I believe that Christ conquered sin for me.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   I want Jesus to be my Lord and Savior."
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   Just tell him, say, "God, I give my life to you tonight.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   I surrender my life to you tonight."
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   And then I want to...
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   I just want to ask some people here,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   maybe you've been struggling with porn for a long time,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   and you've never told anyone.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   You don't have to do this if you're struggling with porn.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   I just want to give it as an opportunity.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   Maybe you just need to be known for a minute.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   Maybe this is just between you, me, and God.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   If you're sitting there just saying,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   "Look, for the first time, I just need to be known.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   I'm ready to be done with this.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   I'm tired of this. I'm tired of the secrecy."
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   If that's you, it would just be helpful for you,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   with everyone's eyes closed, to slip up your hand and just say,
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   "Yeah, you're talking to me. I'm tired of this.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   I've never told anyone about this,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   but I just need to be known right now in this moment,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   at least by God and that guy on the stage.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Porn is kind of my deal right now."
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   Just put your hand up real quick.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   If that's you, I just want to invite you right now to just say,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   "God, I know you see me.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   I'm just going to trust that you love me
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   and that you're for me
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   and that there's hope for me.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Would you give me hope today?"
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   We're going to sing in a minute.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   It's going to just be an opportunity for you to respond.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   If you need to get on your knees to confess before the Lord, you can.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   If you want to stand and praise and gratitude
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   that God has moved you towards freedom,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   if you need to sit there and text a friend to just say,
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   "Look, I need your help," there's just a space to respond.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   And so I pray, Lord God, I pray I speak the name of Jesus
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   over this room tonight and the power that is found solely in his name,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Lord, I pray that there would be a movement among young adults
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   in Dallas, Texas, and all over this nation
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   of young adults just saying, "Look, Jesus is better.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   I want Jesus. I want freedom."
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   So Lord, would you come and move in our lives tonight?
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   We need you and love you.
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
