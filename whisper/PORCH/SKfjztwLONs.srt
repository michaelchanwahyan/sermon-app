 [Music]

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 What's up, Porch? How we doing? Let's go. How we doing? We doing good?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 You know, that seems like the appropriate question to ask whenever I get up here.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Just to amass a massive amount of applause and cheering and ruckus, but like,

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 really, how are you doing tonight? Good? Yeah? Good. Blessed? Stressed?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Coming from work? I don't know about you.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I was just sitting over there and I just felt like anxious, man.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And it's probably because I'm speeding into tonight.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Like I feel like I've been steamrolling all day and I'm racing into this evening.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And I just had this moment where, as I was sitting there,

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 it just felt like the Lord was asking me to just, hey, just take a breath.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Like, calm down, slow down. I don't know about you.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I don't know where you're coming from.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Maybe you're walking in and you're like, dude,

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I have been like in step with the spirit all day. I feel amazing.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Maybe you're here and you're like, man, I haven't been able to shut off work.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I'm still thinking about what's coming up tomorrow. I didn't, I didn't really engage.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I didn't feel any sort of emotion over the course of those last three songs.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 If that's you, that was me. And I just want to tell you,

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 you haven't missed it yet.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Like God has something for you tonight.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We genuinely believe that every person that walks into this room,

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 God has brought you here very specifically, whether you know him or not.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Our genuine belief is, is no one is in this room by accident.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So we're really glad you're here. We're really glad you're here.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We believe that God wants to do something in your life tonight.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And we also think that God's doing things all over the nation.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And so I want to give a special shout out to some Porch Live locations that are

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 tuning in with us tonight. I want to say hey to Fresno, to Atlanta, and to Scottsdale.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 God is doing a good thing here, but he's doing a good thing there.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And so we thank y'all for tuning in and being a part of what God is doing through the porch.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Friends, we've been in a series called Ins and Outs.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And the entire purpose of this series is to ask the question,

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 do my goals align with God's will?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 And what we realized as we were looking through the research and we were parsing through the data is,

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 by and large, we have three goals. Our generation, whether you're Gen Z or you're millennial,

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 the young adults of the world have said there are three things we want.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 We want to be self-sufficient. We want to be self-fulfilled.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And we want to be self-accepted.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 These are the things that we have said are in for 2024.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I don't know what you've been thinking,

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 but this is what the other young adults in the room have said is true of themselves.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 They have voted this is the case.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 The last two weeks, we've talked about why self-fulfillment and self-sufficiency are actually out.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And God has something else in for us instead.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Tonight, we're going to be talking about why self-acceptance is out according to the will of God.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And to help us unpack that idea, we have a very special friend in the room with us tonight.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 We have Mr. Nate Hilgenkamp.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Give him a round of applause, everybody.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Nate is the teaching pastor at Harris Creek in Waco.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He's also one of the co-hosts on the Becoming Something podcast.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 He's a dear friend of my own.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And here's what you need to know about Nate.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 He's going to crush it up here.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But as great as he is up here, he's even better on the floor.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 He is an incredible communicator of God's will, but he is also -- he's a great example of Christ's likeness.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And so we are thrilled, honored to have you here with us, bro.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So friends, do it one more time.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Give Nate Hilgenkamp a round of applause as he comes to the stage.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Love you, brother.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Love you, brother.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Love you.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Well, those are some kind words about me, but who cares about me?

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I'm going home after tonight.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Let me tell you a little bit about your guy, Kylan.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I know you just kind of got to meet him a couple of weeks ago.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I've got to know him for a little bit longer than that.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 So let me just tell you a little bit about who he is.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I want to tell you about three things.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 The first is this.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 He kind of took the words out of my mouth.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 He is much better off the stage than he is on the stage.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 He can preach the lights out, but he's a far better minister just in front of people one on one.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I've seen him do an amazing job counseling young adults year after year off the stage, not just on the stage.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Secondly, I've got to process some things with him in my life, some things that maybe haven't gone how we expected them to go,

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and he's always driven me to faith.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 He's always driven me to trust in Jesus.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 He's a man of deep faith.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And then thirdly, I've got to see him lead huddles before every single young adult event I've got to do with him,

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 and every single one of those huddles is fueled by prayer.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So three things about Kylan that you need to know.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 He's a better person off the stage than on the stage.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He's a man of great faith, and he's a man of great prayer,

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 and I cannot think of a better person to lead the porch for the next 40 years.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Is that what you told me?

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 40 years.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 He's committing to 40 years.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 He's going to do an amazing job.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Yeah.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Well, I just wanted to start tonight by telling you I worked at a church in Waco, Texas,

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 and for seven years I was the college pastor there,

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 which meant I really did one thing with my job because Baylor University is located on this side.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 There we go.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Oh, man, that makes me so happy.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 On this side of 35 and right on the other side of 35 is a Chick-fil-A, which was essentially my office for seven years.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 I was there about three or four times a week just meeting with college students,

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 and one day I went in like I do nearly every other day and go up and place my order,

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 the spicy chicken sandwich meal with a Coke Zero, and didn't really think anything of it.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But once I stood in line and got up to the counter, there was like this teenage kid who was working there,

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 and he was just very excited to be working at Chick-fil-A that day.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And he saw me, and he goes, "Ben, it's so good to see you today.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Can I take your order?"

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Again, my name's Nate, not Ben.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 So in that moment I'm like, "Okay, what am I going to do?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Do I correct him or not?"

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I'm like, "This guy's a teenager.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 He's a high schooler.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 He's just happy to be here.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 He doesn't really know me, but he thinks he knows me, so I'm just going to roll with it."

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So I place my order, sit back down, don't think anything of it, show back again.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 I don't know if it was the next day or the day after that.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And I walk in the doors and realize that he's working again.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And I'm like, "Lord, please do not let me go to his register."

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 So I walk in the line and get to his register, and he goes, "Ben!

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 It's so good to see you.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 So glad you're back.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 What can I get for you today?"

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And at that point, I'm like in it too deep.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I can't correct him now.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So at that point, I'm just like, "I guess whenever I step in these walls, I am Ben now."

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So I kid you not, I still cannot believe I did this.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 For the next few months, whenever I would go to Chick-fil-A, whether it was him or someone else,

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I'd say, "Yeah, my name is Ben."

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And one day, I was sadly going through the drive-thru by myself,

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 and they were standing there with the iPad, and it wasn't this guy.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 It was someone else, and he goes, "Okay, and what's your name?"

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And I just said, "Hey, my name's Ben."

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And then I get up to the drive-thru window, and my nightmare happened.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 One of my friends was working, and he goes, "Nate, I am so sorry.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Like this typically doesn't happen. You know, we're Chick-fil-A, but we lost your order.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 What can I make for you? We'll do it really, really fast, I promise."

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And I said, "You know what? Do you by chance have an order for Ben?"

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And he goes, "Yeah, it's the next one. Why?"

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I go, "I accidentally said my name was Ben."

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And he just like took the bag and handed it to me.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It was like, "What in the world is going on?"

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And I'll never forget leaving Chick-fil-A that day.

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 As I was leaving, I was like, "For the rest of my life, whenever I go into that Chick-fil-A, I'm no longer Ben.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I'm going to walk in with my chest out and say, 'I am Nate Hilgenkamp, thank you very much,'

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 because that teenage kid had no right to rename me."

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And that is a ridiculous story. It's a 100% true story.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I bet you don't have that story.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 But I bet your story might look a little bit similar to it.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Because I bet you've been renamed.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I don't know who it's been for you, but maybe growing up, your mom told you one day,

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 "You know, you're just not really as pretty as the other girls in your class."

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 But that's happened to some of you. It has.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And in the back of your mind, from that day moving forward, for years now,

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 you feel like you've been renamed as, "I'm just not very pretty."

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Or maybe some of you, you've been renamed by a boyfriend.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 You were dating for a while, and eventually you broke up, and he said,

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 "You know, whenever we're together, I just don't really enjoy my time with you."

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And so from that moment on, you've just gone by the name "unenjoyable."

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Or maybe you've let a sin rename you, whether it be lust, or drinking too much, or cynicism.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 You've just let this sin grow in your heart and in your mind,

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 and in the back of your mind, it has renamed you as "damaged goods."

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Or maybe you've had a teacher rename you, or a coach rename you, or a boss rename you,

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and say, "You know, you're just not really as good as everyone else."

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And in the back of your mind, your name is now "unsuccessful."

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And you've been carrying around a name for far too long.

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And you've allowed someone to rename you who has no right to rename you.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Now, some of you know that.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 You know that other people don't have the power to rename you,

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 so you've decided to take it within your own power to rename you.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 You've got these daily affirmations, these things you want to speak over your life,

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 you want to manifest into your life, so you've decided that you want your name to be something like,

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 "I am successful," or "I am attractive," or "I am wanted."

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And day after day, you're telling yourself this.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You're trying to rename yourself.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 You're trying to manifest it into your life, and I just want you to know something.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 If that's you, you are taking a name from someone who has no power to rename you.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Because they can't rename you, your sin can't rename you, and you can't rename you.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 There's only one person who can name you, and that's what we're going to talk about tonight.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Who has God named you to be, and what does that mean for your life?

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 We're going to talk about that what is out is self-image or self-acceptance,

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 who you view yourself to be, and what is in is God's acceptance and God's image,

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 who he has declared you to be.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And we're going to take a look at that in Scripture in 1 Peter.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So if you've got your Bibles, open up to 1 Peter.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Just to give you some help, it's right before 2 Peter.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Find 2 Peter, and then just flip right before it, and you'll be right there.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And there's a lot of different places in Scripture where we can go to look at what God has named us.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 But I want to go here because, man, this is a name I haven't really thought a whole lot before.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 I studied this text, and this is a name that has just absolutely gripped me.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And just some setup on 1 Peter.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It was written during a time of immense persecution for the church.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 It was written by Peter, and it was written during a time when Nero was the emperor of Rome.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 If you don't know anything about Nero, he was an incredibly depraved man, an evil, evil man.

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I could tell you a number of stories. Here's potentially one of the worst.

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 He was married to someone, and then he actually killed her.

191
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Historians believe that he beat her to death.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Shortly thereafter, he saw a young boy who he thought looked like his now deceased wife,

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 so he took that boy, castrated that boy, married that boy, and made him dress up like his ex-wife.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Like it's evil stuff. Evil stuff.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Here's another. You maybe heard of the great fire of Rome.

196
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 That was, historians believe, likely started by Nero himself.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 As the emperor, he set ablaze the entire city of Rome, and it actually set 75% of the city on fire.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 He did it because he wanted to rebuild the city however he saw fit.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Once the fire had been put out, he needed someone to blame.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He had a people group that he did not like very much, so he decided to blame the great fire of Rome on Christians.

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 From that moment on, he began the systematic massacre of Christians.

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Some were killed by animals. Some were lifted up on crosses to die,

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 while others were lifted up on poles and lit aflame at night to serve as lamps to the city of Rome.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 True story.

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Now, this is what's going on when Peter wrote this book.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 This is what's happening to the church. They're being persecuted immensely.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So what Peter's going to say is, the only way you're going to make it through this persecution,

208
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 the only way you're going to make it through this pain, is if you know two things.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 If you know who you are and what that means for you.

210
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 One of the reasons why I wanted to teach 1 Peter is because the trend is not our friend in American culture today.

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 American culture is not drifting more and more towards Christianity, but it's drifting more and more towards hostility towards Christianity.

212
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 While we are not where they were at the time of this writing, we're getting closer and closer.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And the only way you're going to make it through that is if you know two things.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 If you know who you are and what that means for you.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So that's what I'm going to try to answer tonight.

216
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 We're going to be in 1 Peter chapter 1, looking at verse 1.

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Peter writes this.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect exiles, scattered throughout the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Now all of that is in what is now today's modern Turkey.

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Now this next verse, I don't know another verse that more completely and accurately describes the Trinity.

221
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Check this out. It says this.

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Those of you who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit,

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood, grace and peace be yours in abundance.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Okay, so by my count, there's three names that Peter gives us here.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Elect, chosen, and exiles.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Now what's interesting to me, maybe it's interesting to you, two of those names are really similar.

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Elect and chosen, while the other is very different.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 The name exile.

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And what I find fascinating is right there in verse 1, he brings the two together.

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 This is what he says. He says that he's writing to the elect exiles.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 To the chosen, unchosen ones.

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And this is the first thing we can learn tonight.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 This is what you've been named. Point number one.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 In Jesus, we are elect exiles.

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 We're elect exiles.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Now how can we be both of those names at once?

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 That doesn't really make sense. Those two names mean two very different things.

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 How can we be those two names at the same time?

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Let me break down that name by breaking down both of those words.

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Let's start by talking about elect or chosen.

241
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And I want to explain that word by telling you about one of my favorite moments I had while I was dating my now wife Adelie in college.

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Whenever we were just dating, we were, for those of you that went to Baylor or been in Waco,

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 we were driving down the street called Valley Mills, which is kind of this street that just kind of cuts through the heart of the city.

244
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And it was a very normal day, but I will never forget where I was when this happened.

245
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Because we were at a stoplight, headed back to school, and I'm just looking over at my girlfriend, talking with her, enjoying being with her.

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And as I'm talking with her, I realize out of the corner of my eye that the car next to us is not very happy with me.

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Like she's in this car and she's screaming at me, going like this, doing everything she possibly can do to get my attention.

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Until eventually, she opens her car door.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 She doesn't even roll down her window. I assume because she can't, but she just opens up her window, gets out of her car, and is screaming at me like this.

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 So, being the man in the relationship, I rolled down the passenger window so my wife could take the first blow.

251
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And I'm assuming I'm about to get in a fight, and I just look over at her, and she's screaming, making a scene.

252
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 She's going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey!"

253
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And I roll down the window, and she goes, "Son, I have never seen a man look at a woman the way you're looking at that girl.

254
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And if you don't put a ring on her finger, you've lost your mind!"

255
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah. That can only happen in Waco. I mean, truly.

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And I love that story because it's like I remember how I felt when I was dating Adelie Lambert.

257
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 I was like, "I cannot believe she chose me!"

258
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Like, I didn't have a whole lot to offer at Baylor.

259
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I wasn't in a fraternity. I was a religion major.

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Like, didn't have a path to make a whole lot of money.

261
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Like, there wasn't a whole lot going for me.

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And she chose me.

263
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So, whenever we were with her, whenever I was with her, I was like, "I cannot believe that I get to be with Adelie Lambert.

264
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 I cannot believe that she chose me!"

265
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 You know, in your relationship with God, you've probably been told, you know, you need to be with God.

266
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And you do, but you've got a lot going on. You've got a lot of chaos in your life.

267
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And so, in the chaos of your life, maybe you wake up, and you just keep telling yourself,

268
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 "Okay, today I want to choose Jesus today. I want to choose Jesus today. I want to choose Jesus today."

269
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I just want you to know, if that's your thinking in this relationship, you've got the dynamics all messed up.

270
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Because it's not, "Okay, today I have to choose Jesus."

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's instead, "I cannot believe that He chose me."

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 This is what Peter is writing to the church. He's going, "Guys, the God of the universe has chosen you.

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Jesus, the Savior of the world, wants you. Your Father so deeply loves you that He sent His Son to live for you.

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 He sent Him to be crucified for you. He sent Him to die for you. He sent Him to resurrect for you.

275
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And I don't know about you, but I didn't have a whole lot to offer to God.

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 All I had done is run from His presence, throw myself in a pit, and cover myself in shame and godlessness and arrogance and lust and a whole host of other sins.

277
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And God saw me in the midst of that pit and said, "I want that one."

278
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 And it's like, "You want that one?" Like the runt of the litter.

279
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 "You want that one?" And God's going, "Yes, I want that one. I want Him. I want Her. I choose Them."

280
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And you see, when we were lost, God found us. When we were dirty, our God cleansed us.

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And when we were dead, our God raised us. Why? Because He wants you.

282
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And this is the first part of this name, "Elect Exiles."

283
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Friends, He's chosen you. Out of the crowd, He wants you, not because you have anything to offer, but because it's His desire to have a relationship with you.

284
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 So that's the first part of the passage, "Elect" or "Chosen."

285
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 How can the other part be "Exile"? How are we the "Elect Exiles"?

286
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Well, here's what ends up happening.

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Whenever you realize that you're chosen by God, this world is going to start to not choose you.

288
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Because whenever you feel at home in God's presence, you're just not going to feel at home here.

289
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And that word "exile" here in this passage, it can also be translated as "foreigner."

290
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 So what Peter's trying to describe to the church is he's saying, what you should feel is that feeling is, if you've ever been out of the country, gone to a faraway country,

291
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 you get off the plane, you walk off the airport, and you're just hit with a whole lot of difference.

292
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You don't really understand the language that people are speaking.

293
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 You don't understand the food that people are eating.

294
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 You don't understand where everyone's trying to get to because you don't really know where anything is.

295
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 You just kind of feel lost there.

296
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 What Peter's saying here is he's saying, that's how we should feel as believers on this earth.

297
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We should frequently feel lost here because our home is not here.

298
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And it's not just Peter that says this, but Paul says this elsewhere in Philippians chapter 3, verse 20.

299
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 He says, "Our citizenship is in heaven because we're just foreigners here."

300
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 So we should not understand the language of this world.

301
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We should not understand the way people speak.

302
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 We should not understand what this world consumes.

303
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Be it alcohol or entertainment or drugs. We shouldn't understand what the world consumes.

304
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 We shouldn't understand where the world's trying to get to.

305
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Whether they're trying to climb the ladder at their career, whether they're trying to get into a certain neighborhood,

306
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 or whether they're trying to get into a certain social status.

307
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 We shouldn't understand what everyone's trying to do here because here is not our home.

308
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 We should feel lost here.

309
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Because when we're foreigners here, we don't do as the world does.

310
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And when we don't do as the world does, this world will treat you like outcasts.

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 This world will look at you and it will treat you like an absolute loser.

312
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 This world will look at you and tell you that you are unwanted.

313
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 This world will look at you and tell you that you are unenjoyable.

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 This world will look at you and tell you that you are unsuccessful.

315
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And that's okay because we're not living for their approval.

316
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 We're living from His approval.

317
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Because we're the elect exiles for crying out loud.

318
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 We're chosen by Him so we know we're not going to be chosen by this world.

319
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 So whenever you look at the world and the decisions that they make,

320
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 it should feel like they're living by a different playbook.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It should feel like the world is taking different orders than we are.

322
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Because they are.

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 You see, the world takes its orders from the prince of darkness.

324
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 We take our orders from the king of kings.

325
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Of course we feel lost here.

326
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 So point number one, the first thing we can learn, your name,

327
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I hope you get this ingrained in your bones,

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 is that in Jesus we are elect exiles.

329
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 That's who you are.

330
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Let me show you what that means for you in verse 3.

331
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 It says this.

332
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 In His great mercy He has given us a new birth into a living hope

334
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

335
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade.

336
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And this inheritance is kept in heaven for you."

337
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Okay, so why does your name matter?

338
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Well, let's imagine that my name was not Nate Hilgenkamp,

339
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 but instead it was Nate Bezos or Nate Musk or Nate Zuckerberg.

340
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 If that was my name, what could you conclude about me?

341
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I'm rich. That's right.

342
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 You'd be able to conclude that I have access to all my dad has,

343
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 and one day I'm going to receive an absolutely massive inheritance.

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Because, you see, your name means something.

345
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 In this passage, in verse 3, it says that you've been given a new birth.

346
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And when you've been given a new birth, you've been born into a new family.

347
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 When you've been given a new family, you've been given a new name.

348
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 You see, our name isn't just Nate Hilgenkamp, elect exile,

349
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 but it's now Nate Hilgenkamp, child of God.

350
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 What does that mean?

351
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 It means I've got access to all my father has, which is point number two.

352
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Second thing we can learn from this passage.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 In Jesus, we are given an imperishable inheritance.

354
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 So what does that mean?

355
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Let's talk about this for a minute.

356
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 The text says we're receiving an imperishable inheritance.

357
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Do any of you remember NFTs?

358
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Yeah, they were a big deal when we were all, like, bored at home during COVID.

359
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And if you don't know what an NFT is,

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 an NFT is like a screenshot of the Internet that you can buy.

361
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And I know for you crypto bros it's more than that,

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 but it's not more than that.

363
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And let me tell you about one NFT.

364
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Here's a picture of one.

365
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 This is an NFT of the first ever tweet from Jack, the guy who founded Twitter.

366
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And I just took a screenshot of this, but apparently someone else owns it.

367
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And they bought it in 2021 for $2.9 million.

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 $2.9 million.

369
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 A couple years later, really not all that long ago,

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 he put it up for sale and had the bidding for the auction start at $48 million.

371
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 So the bidding went on, and at the conclusion of the bidding,

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 the highest bid that he received was $280.

373
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Not $280 million, $280.

374
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You see, what he did with this investment is he poured $3 million

375
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 into a depreciating asset.

376
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Almost as soon as he purchased this thing, this thing became worthless

377
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 because this thing perished, spoiled, and faded.

378
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Now, can you even imagine making an investment like that?

379
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Of course you can.

380
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Because some of you are doing that right now.

381
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Maybe not with your finances, maybe you haven't bought an NFT,

382
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 but Scripture says that whenever you invest your life in this world,

383
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 this world is going to leave you bankrupt.

384
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Your career is going to leave you empty.

385
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 Your social status is going to leave you empty.

386
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Your net worth is going to leave you empty.

387
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 It will perish, spoil, and fade.

388
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But on the other hand, Scripture says here that our heavenly Father

389
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 has an inheritance for us that can either perish, spoil, or fade.

390
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 That means it's not going anywhere.

391
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 That means the economy can't touch it.

392
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 That means your performance can't touch it because God is holding it in his hands.

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And there's going to be a day either when Jesus comes back

394
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 or you die and go be with him, and he's going to give you all that he has.

395
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And that's good news.

396
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And that should be a relief for us.

397
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 But many times it's not.

398
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Like you ever think about that?

399
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Like why don't you think about that every single day?

400
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Like if you knew that you had an inheritance coming that was $100 billion,

401
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 wouldn't you not be as stressed about paying your rent this month?

402
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Like if you knew what was coming,

403
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 wouldn't you be a little bit less anxious, a little bit less stressed?

404
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 And many times we're not, and I don't know.

405
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Maybe it's because you don't actually believe it.

406
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 I know for many of us here in this room, we are Christians.

407
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 We claim to be followers of Jesus.

408
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 But let's just look at the text one more time.

409
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 This is what it says in verse 3.

410
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 It says that the Christian is the one who has been given a new birth.

411
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 You must be totally reborn.

412
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 You're not an updated version of the old you.

413
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 You're an alive version of the dead you.

414
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And then it says you've been given a new birth into a living hope.

415
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Now here's where we need to wake up.

416
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 For many of us, we've been lulled to sleep, thinking we're Christians.

417
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Meanwhile, we put our hope into things that are dying.

418
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Or maybe for you, the thing that you hope more than anything else happens this year,

419
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 like your deepest desire for this year,

420
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 your hope is that this would be the year you get into a relationship.

421
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Or maybe for you, your hope is that one day you'd finally be an executive at your company.

422
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 That's your hope.

423
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Or maybe for you, your hope is that one day you'd be able to afford that car or those clothes.

424
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And I just want you to know, if that's you, you have a dying hope, not a living hope.

425
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And if that's you, and if you claim to be a follower of Jesus, I just want to say that's confusing.

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Because if you are living this life for this life,

427
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 it makes it look like you don't believe in the next life.

428
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Because you see, on the other hand, what this text says is it says that the Christian has a living hope.

429
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 So what does that mean?

430
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 That means you've placed your hope in something or someone that is alive and cannot die.

431
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Well, who would that be?

432
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The text says this, verse 3,

433
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 "You have a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."

434
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 That means you've not placed your hope in the things of this world.

435
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 That means you've placed all your eggs in the basket of Jesus.

436
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 You've placed all your hope in the fact that Jesus came and lived a life you couldn't live.

437
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 He died a death that you deserve to die.

438
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And then he rose again so that death no longer has mastery over him,

439
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 and so that it might no longer have mastery over you.

440
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 And friend, when you believe in that,

441
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 God doesn't just raise Jesus from the dead, but he raises you from the dead.

442
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 He brings you from death to life,

443
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 and you've been reborn, as the text says, into a new family where you've received a new name.

444
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And with this new name comes an inheritance.

445
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 It comes with all your father has.

446
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Well, what does he have?

447
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 What did Jesus Christ accomplish on this earth?

448
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 He defeated death so that he could have eternal life for all of us.

449
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 That's what he has, and that's what he's eager to give you.

450
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 That's your inheritance as a follower of Jesus.

451
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 That's the second thing we can learn from this passage.

452
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Point number two, in Jesus we have an imperishable inheritance.

453
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Now, that's a large benefit.

454
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 I want to tell you another benefit we have as elect exiles.

455
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Let's read the end of verse 4, and then we're going to read verse 5.

456
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 It says this.

457
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 "This inheritance is kept in heaven for you,

458
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 who through faith are shielded by God's power

459
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time."

460
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Now, this right here is one of the most important parts of Peter's teaching,

461
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 because he's saying we make it to our salvation not because of who we are,

462
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 but because of who he is.

463
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Because if you've got your Bibles open, like look at the text.

464
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 What does it say?

465
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 It says, "We make it to the coming of our salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time."

466
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Now, by the shielding of God's power.

467
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 It's not about your power.

468
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 It's about his, and this is the third thing we can learn from this passage.

469
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Point number three, in Jesus we are shielded by God's power.

470
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Now, I think this is the best way I can describe it.

471
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 This summer our family went to Branson, Missouri.

472
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 We got to spend a week at Canica, which is just a great ministry.

473
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 As a part of that time at the family camp, we got to go on the Lake Tanticoma,

474
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 which is really more like a river.

475
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 In fact, I've got a picture of it here.

476
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 I was on the boat with my wife and my, at the time, like 2-year-old daughter.

477
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And Branson's a weird place for so many reasons.

478
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 And one of those reasons is this lake, because this lake pulls its water from another lake,

479
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 the Table Rock Lake, and it pulls its water from the bottom of another lake.

480
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 So this water is like always freezing.

481
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 If you could actually put the picture up again, there's a fog on the lake at all times,

482
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 because in this picture it was really, really hot outside.

483
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 It was like 95 degrees and humid, but the water was, I don't know, 35 degrees or something like that.

484
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 And so there's always this fog on the water.

485
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So even though it's really, really hot outside, when you're on the water, it's actually really, really cold.

486
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And we'd been driving around on this boat for a while, and I don't know if it was a mile or so,

487
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 and we were having a great time until we stopped having a great time,

488
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 because my 2-year-old daughter lost her mind.

489
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And when a 2-year-old loses their mind, like there's really no way of fixing it,

490
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 because she just kept going, "Dad, I'm cold! I want to get off the boat!

491
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I want to get off the boat! Take me back! The wind's in my face, Dad! I'm cold!"

492
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 And so I'm like, "Okay, we've got to get off this boat, but we've got a ways to go."

493
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 So I asked the driver if he could turn around and go back to camp, and he's like, "Yeah, no problem."

494
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But it still was like a ways back, and she wasn't calming down,

495
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 because we kept driving, the wind's still in her face, and she just keeps going,

496
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 "Dad! I want to get off the boat! I'm so cold! Get me out of here!"

497
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And so eventually, as her dad, I went over to her, I picked her up,

498
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 and then I placed her in front of me, and I put my back up against the wind.

499
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And over and over again, for 20 minutes, I kept saying,

500
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 "JC, we're almost back! We're going to make it! Dad's going to keep you safe!"

501
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And I did my best to block the wind, I just kept saying over and over again,

502
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 "JC, we're almost back! We're going to make it! Dad's going to keep you safe!"

503
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 You know, life's hard. I don't know what you've been through.

504
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 I can tell you what I've been through. I could give you a number of examples,

505
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 but just about 13 months ago, my wife and I, we had a miscarriage, and it was so hard.

506
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 And in that time in my life, it just felt like the winds of this world were blowing straight in my face.

507
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You want to know what else I felt? I felt my Heavenly Father pick me up,

508
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 turn His back to the wind, and say, "Nate, we're going home! You're going to make it! Dad's going to keep you safe!"

509
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 I don't know what you've been through in your life. I bet you've been through some really hard things.

510
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 But I just want you to know that if you're a believer in Jesus, even in those moments when it feels like the wind is blowing at your face,

511
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 your Heavenly Father is there picking you up, turning His back towards the wind and saying,

512
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 "Son, daughter, you're going to make it! We're headed back! Dad's going to keep you safe!"

513
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And I know that tonight, I'm in Dallas, Texas. We're in a room full of highly competent people.

514
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Dallas is filled with really gifted people, really successful people, really strong people.

515
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Dallas is all about what you can achieve. Like, I've got to go achieve this in my career.

516
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 I've got to go achieve this social status. I've got to go out and get what's mine by my own strength.

517
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Friend, I just want you to know, there will be times in your life when the winds of this world will be stronger than you are,

518
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 and it will blow you onto your back, and you won't have the strength to get up.

519
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 The good news of Scripture is, you don't make it home on your own strength.

520
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 You make it home by your Father's shielding.

521
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And I just want you to know tonight, the lie of Dallas, Texas, is that you have to go out and make a name for yourself.

522
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 You have to go out and prove yourself.

523
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 The truth of Scripture is, you don't need to prove anything, because your salvation is not dependent upon you.

524
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Your sanctification is not dependent upon you. Your stability is not dependent upon you.

525
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Your safety is not dependent upon you, because your life is not about you.

526
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Because let me just show you what it says right here in the text, over and over and over again.

527
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Listen again to the words used in this passage. It says, in verse 1,

528
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 "To God's elect, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit,

529
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 and in His great mercy, He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

530
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 And this inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God's power."

531
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 You see, all of that is describing God's preeminence, and not your performance.

532
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 And friend, this is the joy in following Jesus.

533
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Your name is not dependent upon what you do.

534
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 You don't receive a name because you've earned it.

535
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 You don't receive a name because you deserve it.

536
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Because in Jesus, you are not defined by your net worth.

537
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by the car you drive.

538
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by your physical appearance.

539
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by your career.

540
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by your social status.

541
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by the clothes you wear.

542
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by anyone else.

543
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 In Jesus, you are not defined by your sin.

544
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 In Jesus, you are not even defined by you, because in Jesus, you are defined by Jesus.

545
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 And scripture makes it very clear that He's declared you to be His son or daughter.

546
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And if that's who He says you are, then that's who you are.

547
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 [Applause]

548
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Not because you've earned it, because you deserve it,

549
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 but because He's declared it to be true.

550
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And friend, I just want you to know,

551
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 you don't have to go out and make a name for yourself, because He's already given you one.

552
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 So in summary, three things we can learn.

553
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 Point number one, in Jesus, we are elect exiles.

554
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Point number two, in Jesus, we have an imperishable inheritance.

555
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 And point number three, in Jesus, we are shielded by God's power.

556
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 Now, this book, 1 Peter, was written by Peter.

557
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Maybe you don't know a whole lot about Peter, but let me just tell you a little bit about his life.

558
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Peter was not actually his name given to him at birth.

559
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 His birth name was Simon.

560
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 And he was named Simon and lived his life.

561
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 And then eventually Jesus came and found him and said, "Follow me."

562
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 So Simon left everything and he followed Jesus.

563
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And then after they started doing ministry for a while, Jesus pulled him aside and He said,

564
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 "Simon, I'm going to rename you.

565
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Your name is no longer Simon, but your name is now Peter.

566
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 And on this rock, I will build my church."

567
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 And then there's a really important moment in the Gospels where Jesus was arrested

568
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 and He's standing before Pontius Pilate.

569
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 And at that moment, Peter, perhaps his closest friend, was found right by a fire.

570
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 And maybe you know this story, maybe you don't.

571
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 But when his best friend was arrested, when his best friend was about to die,

572
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 he was there watching from a distance.

573
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And three separate times, people came up to him and said, "Hey, do you know him?"

574
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And he said, "No, I don't know that man."

575
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 And then they said, "Man, it sure seems like you know him.

576
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 You talk a lot like him. Do you know him?"

577
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And he says, "Surely I do not know him."

578
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 And then a third time, someone said, "Do you know him? I saw you with him."

579
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And he says, "No, I don't know that man."

580
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 And then the rooster crowed.

581
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Then Jesus left that place, was crucified, died, and resurrected.

582
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And one of my favorite stories in the Gospel,

583
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Jesus comes and finds his friend on the other side of the resurrection.

584
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And Peter's going out fishing, and Jesus appears on the sand,

585
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 and Peter leaves the boat to go and find Jesus.

586
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And I noticed this, really, this moment for the first time

587
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 as I was rereading it, putting together this message.

588
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 I've read this story a lot, but I was struck by one thing in this moment.

589
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 This moment's typically called the restoration of Peter.

590
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 And what Jesus does here is he approaches Peter,

591
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 and he says something interesting.

592
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 He says, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

593
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 And Peter says, "Lord, you know I love you."

594
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And Jesus once again says, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

595
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 And Peter says, "Lord, you know I love you."

596
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 And then a third time, Jesus says, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

597
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And Peter says, "You know I love you, Lord."

598
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 And I was just struck by that moment because I was struck by the name

599
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 that Jesus spoke over Peter.

600
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 He called him Simon, his worldly name,

601
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 the name that was given to him by his parents,

602
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 not the name that was given to him by Jesus.

603
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 And Jesus always does something for a reason.

604
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 And I think perhaps Jesus was going to Peter that day and saying,

605
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 "Who are you going to be?"

606
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Because recently you've been living a whole lot like Simon.

607
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 You've been living like the name this world has given you,

608
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 but I've given you another name.

609
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 So, Simon, who are you going to be?

610
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Who are you going to listen to?

611
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Well, from that moment on, the rest of the Gospels and the book of Acts,

612
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Simon would go by the name Peter, and he'd live like he was Peter.

613
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 I think you've got an opportunity tonight.

614
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 So I think your Heavenly Father may be asking you, "Who are you going to be?"

615
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 What name are you going to listen to?

616
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 Because recently you've been living a whole lot like that name this world has given you,

617
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 but I've given you a different name.

618
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 So, son, daughter, who are you going to be?

619
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 Are you going to continue to go by the name unenjoyable, unsuccessful,

620
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 unwanted, broken, forgotten?

621
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Or are you going to go by the name that I've given you,

622
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 loved, chosen, seen, forgiven, accepted?

623
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Which name are you going to go by?

624
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Who are you going to be?

625
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 Or maybe a better question is, who are you going to listen to?

626
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Are you going to listen to the voices in this world,

627
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 or are you going to listen to the victorious voice of your Heavenly Father?

628
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Who are you going to listen to tonight?

629
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Let me pray that it would be Jesus.

630
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 Father, I am just so grateful that you know all of us by name,

631
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 that you know us even before we were formed in our mother's womb.

632
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And, God, I just thank you that you have given us a name

633
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 that we don't feel like we deserve.

634
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 I know there's a lot of people in here tonight, watching tonight,

635
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 and they feel covered in shame.

636
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 They feel covered in sin.

637
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 And they feel like they don't measure up to any name you've given them in Scripture.

638
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Father, would you just remind us tonight that we don't earn our name,

639
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 but we receive our name.

640
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Our name is not given to us because of what we've done in our life,

641
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 but because of what Jesus did in his life.

642
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 And he lived the perfect life we couldn't live.

643
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 He died the death we deserve to die.

644
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 And he rose again victoriously so that he could bestow on us a new name,

645
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 so that he could bestow on us an imperishable inheritance,

646
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 and so that you could block us,

647
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 so that you could shield us from the winds of this world that want to take us out.

648
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 And, God, I just pray for all of my friends here in this room,

649
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 I pray that we make it home with you.

650
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 I pray that every single day we wouldn't fall in love with the things of this world,

651
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 but we'd fall in love with you.

652
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 Not just having a mindset of, okay, I've got to choose Jesus,

653
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 I've got to choose Jesus, I've got to choose Jesus,

654
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 but instead having a mindset of, I cannot believe he's chosen me.

655
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 And, God, what we want to do tonight is we want to worship you like we've been forgiven.

656
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 We want to worship you like we've been renamed.

657
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 We want to worship you like we're alive because we are, because of what you've done.

658
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 Because the only reason we've got hope tonight is because of one thing.

659
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 It's because Jesus is alive and with us and for us, and it's in his name we pray.

660
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 Amen.

661
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 Well, Ports, I know a lot of you have come in with a lot of different things,

662
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 and I just want you to know we've got a team up front who are eager to talk to you and pray with you,

663
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 but what we want to do now is we want to worship our risen king.

664
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,840
 Do that now.

665
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,420
 (upbeat music)
