68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:01,240
 We're going to talk tonight about a subject that God's Word is abundantly clear on, related to sex before marriage.

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,820
 And that first part of the sentence, you may be surprised.

70
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,740
 It's your first time in church.

71
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,580
 You're like, "I can't believe he just said that."

72
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,060
 Sex before marriage is amazing because sex is amazing.

73
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,180
 Because God created it to be.

74
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,100
 It's an incredible gift.

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,420
 Let's just start there.

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,820
 In fact, all of you already know that, or the large majority, that's not shocking news to you.

77
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,260
 And anybody who grew up and told you that, "Oh, you know, sex is a terrible thing.

78
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,100
 You know, I'm going to do it," was lying or had never had it.

79
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:36,320
 And the truth is sex, in any context, or sex before marriage, physically or pleasurably, is amazing.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,080
 But it can also be incredibly destructive.

81
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,440
 As a society, you know, people assume that it's so amazing that people are not, of course, they're going to have sex before marriage.

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,920
 Which is why in most sex education courses you took in high school or even in college, they didn't start with, "Hey, this is for marriage."

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,960
 They just ended up going, "This is how it's done.

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,120
 Here's a bunch of condoms.

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,600
 Who wants them?"

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,520
 Right?

87
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,100
 And the world assumption is that sex is amazing, which is why it's all over the TV.

88
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,220
 It's in every sitcom.

89
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,820
 It's in every show that you watch where there's just something in all of us that, you know, is excited and the thrill and excitement of that.

90
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,740
 We know it's amazing.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:23,740
 Ninety-five percent of people, before they get married, statistically, or over 90 percent, have sex or have had sex with someone before they took vows and pledged, "I do."

92
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:40,700
 But at the same time, while it's amazing, I think most of us, if we were going to take a just sober look at it, we also would acknowledge or would have to recognize there's some clear challenges with the current offense that our world has as it relates to sexuality.

93
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:53,940
 Between one in three and one in five, young adults today have an STD, which means if I had everybody stand up, which I'm not going to, and said, "Sit down," if you don't, somebody around you or somebody near you would.

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,820
 The number of people, on average, that the average young adult has for sexual partners before they get married is eight.

95
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:18,420
 Some of the deepest hurts and pains in all of our lives are connected to the fact that while sex outside of marriage was amazing, it was also destructive and really painful.

96
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:29,540
 Maybe not even sex that you had, somebody in your family or a parent had sex outside of marriage, and it led to the breakdown of your parents' marriage, because they had an affair.

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:41,300
 Some of the deepest pain in the room and a part of our stories and deepest ways all of us have been impacted and even touched at like a soul level has been through sex.

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:49,980
 And some of the hardest moments and pain and tears and breakup are connected to that.

99
00:06:49,980 --> 00:07:00,420
 And so while we know at a heart level that clearly something is not entirely right, there's some things that God is going to say through his word of why it is so destructive.

100
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,740
 And it's not because God is against sex.

101
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,620
 We're about to see that in a second.

102
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,460
 He's so, he created it.

103
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,980
 He invented it.

104
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,900
 He's all about it.

105
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:13,260
 He's all about his children experiencing one of the greatest gifts or one of God's greatest gifts that he gave.

106
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:24,140
 And yet he's going to lay out why it also is something you and I need to approach with a real clarity, because used in the wrong way can be incredibly painful.

107
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,700
 So we're gonna be in 1 Corinthians, chapter six.

108
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,860
 We're gonna look at some teachings of three reasons why Paul would say sex outside of marriage is amazing.

109
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,620
 But it's destructive.

110
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,580
 And I want to say something before we get going.

111
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,900
 I know in a room this size and statistically speaking, most of us have had some level of sexual encounter.

112
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,220
 The vast majority of us have had sex outside of the context of marriage.

113
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:56,180
 And so what Paul is going to lay out tonight, there may be part of you that feels like you've come in a shame, guilt, damaged goods.

114
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,820
 God has done.

115
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,180
 And I want you to hear me abundantly clear.

116
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,580
 Those feelings are not from God.

117
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,780
 That is not the language that he speaks.

118
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,100
 So any shame and guilt that you feel doesn't come from him.

119
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,860
 He speaks the language.

120
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,020
 Second Corinthians tells us of causing conviction that leads to repentance.

121
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,940
 But shame and guilt and you feeling like damaged goods is not from him.

122
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,980
 There's not a person in here.

123
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:23,300
 If you've had 300 sexual partners that God doesn't want to use in incredible ways.

124
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,740
 And that is beyond the length of the love of God.

125
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,020
 And so if you feel those emotions, those are not from the Lord.

126
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,460
 If you feel the emotions of men, I feel like I may need to, today I'm going to make some decisions.

127
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,700
 I'm not doing this anymore.

128
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,860
 Those may be from the Lord.

129
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,620
 But the language of shame and guilt is not what he speaks.

130
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,140
 So we're going to be in First Corinthians, Chapter six.

131
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,220
 Here's what you got to know about Corinthians.

132
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,460
 It was written by the Apostle Paul in the first century, around 60, 50s, late 50s, 80, to the city Corinth.

133
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,380
 And inside of the city of Corinth, there was a new group of Christians meeting in a church much smaller than this.

134
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,180
 Baby believers who were trying to figure out how to live out their faith.

135
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,860
 And they were trying to live out their faith in the belly of the beast, if you will.

136
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,540
 Corinth would have been akin to Las Vegas today.

137
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,820
 In other words, what happens in Corinth stays in Corinth.

138
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,460
 Corinth was a port city that thousands and thousands of travelers would come in and come out.

139
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:27,780
 Which is relevant because it was also where a temple full of a thousand prostitutes lived, worked, were present.

140
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,900
 Where people would come in and they would sleep with prostitutes.

141
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,140
 It was a normal part of life.

142
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,540
 It was accepted.

143
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,660
 And it was just something that people would do all the time.

144
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,460
 There was even a slang term because it was called by one scholar, Corinth was the sexual capital of the world.

145
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:54,780
 So much so that the term Corinthian became a slang term for a prostitute or for a woman who is a prostitute.

146
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,740
 And so if you told your mom you were dating a girl from Corinth, she was not about that.

147
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,540
 Or if T-Pain existed, he would have been singing, "I'm in love with the Corinthian.

148
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,980
 She riding, she riding."

149
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,700
 Because that's just what came to mind.

150
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,340
 Yeah, you didn't think I could work T-Pain into this message, did you?

151
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:26,500
 And so when Paul writes this, it wasn't into some culture that we think of, of Ned Flanders from The Simpsons and everything's buttoned up and that's so outdated.

152
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,860
 It was a sexualized culture beyond even what we think of even today.

153
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,860
 And Paul writes, and he writes to this group of do-baby believers who was doing something that sounds crazy to us.

154
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,500
 But was sleeping with prostitutes in the temple.

155
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,420
 They didn't think it was a big deal.

156
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,060
 And Paul writes and says, "Man, that's because you don't understand sex.

157
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,140
 No one's ever told you."

158
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,820
 Let me explain what sex is and what happens when that happens.

159
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:57,740
 So 1 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 13, he says this, "You say," again, he's writing a letter and he's kind of addressing some of the stuff going on in the church,

160
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,580
 "Food was made for the stomach and stomach for food."

161
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,620
 This is true, though someday God will do away with them both.

162
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,900
 "But you cannot say our bodies were made for sexual morality."

163
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,900
 They were made for the Lord.

164
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,540
 And the Lord cares about our bodies.

165
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,860
 And God will raise us from the dead by his power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead.

166
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:28,300
 So he writes to Corinthians and they had a saying that, hey, you know, food for the stomach, stomach for food, sex for the body, body for sex.

167
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,420
 And Paul said, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

168
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,460
 You think in the same way that, hey, when I get hungry, I eat something.

169
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,340
 You cannot think, hey, when I get horny, I sleep with someone."

170
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,540
 And he's addressing this flawed way of thinking that they had of like, oh, it's not that big of a deal.

171
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,660
 It's just a physical act.

172
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,980
 He says, "You don't realize and you don't understand what sex is."

173
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,500
 Verse 15, "Don't you realize your bodies are actually parts of Christ?

174
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,980
 You've been united with him when you became a Christian.

175
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,500
 Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ, and join it?"

176
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,020
 And the same Greek word for join it is glue it together, unite it together with a prostitute.

177
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,740
 Never.

178
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:14,020
 "Don't you realize if a man joins himself to a prostitute or to someone, a man or woman who's not his wife,"

179
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:20,220
 this is the next line, "he becomes one body with her.

180
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:26,460
 For the scriptures say the two are united into one.

181
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,860
 The two are glued," again that word united, "into one.

182
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,140
 But the person who's joined to the Lord is one in spirit with him."

183
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,740
 So casual sex, he's addressing.

184
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,740
 You guys think it's just casual.

185
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,460
 It's a hookup.

186
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:45,020
 Today, I mean, it's the same, essentially, action taking place of casual hookups, one night stands,

187
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,860
 tender just to get a sexual release.

188
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,740
 And you say, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

189
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,700
 You don't understand sex.

190
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,180
 Sex was this thing that God gave.

191
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,780
 And when you have sex with someone, the two of you are uniting and becoming one."

192
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,740
 And we think, "No, Paul, you clearly don't understand sex because it's just sex.

193
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980
 And it's not that big of a deal."

194
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,940
 And honestly, I don't even remember her name or just was a one night thing.

195
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:16,220
 He's like, "No, you don't understand sex because God gave this incredible gift that every time it happens,

196
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,420
 it's like the two of you are touching and intermingling at the deepest level, at a soul level,

197
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,140
 where the two are becoming one.

198
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,180
 It's not just some casual prostitute at the temple.

199
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,900
 It's not just some one night stand.

200
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,020
 The two of you are joining and doing what God, we're going to get to in a second,

201
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,620
 gave to be this gluing together of two people every time that happens.

202
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:46,180
 And every time that you separate and break off, it's so you're ripping apart what had just been glued together.

203
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,780
 And a little piece of you goes with them and a little piece of them comes with you.

204
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,220
 Says, "You don't understand sex."

205
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,900
 This first idea from the text of why sex can be so devastating is sex has permanence.

206
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,700
 Sex has permanence.

207
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,500
 It's got staying power.

208
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,900
 It's sticky.

209
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
 I don't mean that as a pun.

210
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:11,540
 I mean, quite literally, it was created to bond people together, to be this incredible gift that in the right context,

211
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,460
 bonds people together and makes them more united, have a stronger bond in that relationship together.

212
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,100
 Quite literally, science is catching up to the Bible has been saying for thousands of years.

213
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,980
 In other words, science is now saying, "Hey, every time you have sex, something really interesting happens.

214
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,500
 The body releases these hormones that have been coined the cuddle hormone or the attachment hormone or the love hormone.

215
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,780
 It's something called oxytocin.

216
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,140
 You guys want to see what oxytocin looks like?

217
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,180
 Here's oxytocin.

218
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,900
 This is love.

219
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,820
 That's the sequencing or the breakdown of the molecular level of the hormone of oxytocin.

220
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,060
 Here's what you got to know about oxytocin.

221
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,260
 It's a really interesting hormone.

222
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,100
 I kind of went down the deep dive of hormones this week.

223
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,860
 Women have 10 times the average amount of oxytocin inside of them at any given time.

224
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:05,580
 Oxytocin is associated with childbirth and it's the hormone that when a woman gives birth, she forgets all of the horrific pain.

225
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,700
 Which, God bless women, all the horrific pain that happens in that moment.

226
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,580
 Yes.

227
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,060
 Yes.

228
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,940
 Thank you.

229
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,780
 Thank you, moms everywhere.

230
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:27,540
 Is replaced by this flood of this hormone and that hormone makes her and that baby attach at such a deep way that anybody that tries to pry that baby is going to get

231
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,700
 mama bear because she is so in love and attached to that baby.

232
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:44,900
 The average woman, like I said, has 10 times more, which explains why oxytocin, which is responsible for the general emotional connection that is present or feelings of warmth and affection and bonding.

233
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,220
 It really explains why women are generally better at relating to others emotionally or nicer or why guys are such jerks.

234
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,100
 Because women just have 10 times more on average, kind of all around and connecting and loving and caring people.

235
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:03,580
 With one exception, there is one occasion where both parties, man and woman, have a surge of oxytocin.

236
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,460
 And oxytocin is the thing that makes you want to bond, love, connect.

237
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,700
 It floods.

238
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,380
 That's the hormone.

239
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:16,940
 And that one occasion where both of them surge and are almost at the exact same height or amount is during sex.

240
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:30,500
 But science is saying, hey, there's something that releases, which is why oftentimes when, you know, a boyfriend is having sex, he'll blurt out and go from this is awesome to, oh, my gosh, I think I love you.

241
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 And then the next day he's like, I don't even think we should keep dating.

242
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,380
 And you're like, what?

243
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,380
 Because, listen to me, in that moment, God created this way biologically, scientifically.

244
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:50,940
 You're getting a flood of all these hormones that God geniusly created to flood, to create an attachment in that moment.

245
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,340
 One sex therapist described it as this.

246
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:03,700
 Every time you have intercourse, the body creates an involuntary, you don't choose to do it, chemical commitment.

247
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:14,100
 Another one, UCLA psychiatrist, Miriam Grossman says, it's almost as though you might say what the discoveries of sex have taught us is that we were created to bond.

248
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,220
 Which is true.

249
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,700
 Every time that that happens, there's this flood created to connect in all of your five senses.

250
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,220
 This is why there's an emotional attachment.

251
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,420
 There's a literal attachment with your senses, your taste, sight, hearing, touch.

252
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,300
 And when that sexual intercourse or release happens, it bonds to that person.

253
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,900
 Candidly, this is why that first person that you had sex with, it's so hard to get over.

254
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,060
 Because it's as though they took part of you or you're attached to them.

255
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,940
 And you'd be like, no, I haven't seen them since high school.

256
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,860
 But every now and then you're going on Facebook, you're seeing where they work, you wonder if they're married.

257
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,580
 Is there still part that's attached?

258
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,340
 And Paul would say, that's because that's what sex is.

259
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,460
 Science is just backing up what God already said, which is it was created to fuse or to bond together.

260
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,700
 And this is why it's really important that you and I understand as it relates to sex.

261
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,420
 Before marriage, the problem is not that it's so bad.

262
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,260
 The problem is that it is so good.

263
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,660
 And you're going to create these bonds and these hormones and floods with somebody who is not your spouse.

264
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,140
 And then you're going to rip apart from them.

265
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,620
 And eventually over time, we just get so desensitized where we have to intentionally try to ignore almost those bonds and get over them.

266
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:45,020
 Because of the pain that comes with ripping apart from those sexual relationships to the point where all of a sudden sex, honestly, for a lot of you may be thinking, look, it's not that bonding or permanent or I can have totally casual sex and it doesn't mean anything.

267
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:53,460
 And that would be because Paul would say, you have repeated the process so many times that the stickiness you've become immune to.

268
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,900
 That doesn't mean you're beyond what God can heal and bring about.

269
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,620
 But the effect of this incredible, powerful gift that has permanence has begun to wear off on you.

270
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,140
 It's like this. This is duct tape.

271
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,700
 If I was to take this duct tape.

272
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,740
 And tape it to my arm.

273
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:20,220
 Immediately regrets this decision.

274
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,860
 If this duct tape stays on my arm like now.

275
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,420
 I'm not going to feel any pain.

276
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,700
 It's bonded.

277
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,260
 But if I rip it off, a couple of things are going to happen.

278
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,260
 Okay.

279
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,060
 It's going to be painful.

280
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,380
 And it's going to be increasingly less sticky every time that it goes on there.

281
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:56,660
 In other words, and not just that, but every time it goes on there, it gets less painful and less painful because the stickiness begins to wear off because it wasn't created or sex in a similar way.

282
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,500
 It wasn't created to attach and then rip off.

283
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,580
 It was created to attach to one person in the context of marriage.

284
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,020
 And God's not communicating.

285
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,820
 And I'm not sharing that in order to bring shame or guilt, but to give a framework and understanding for all of us to go.

286
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,380
 This is what God created sex for.

287
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,380
 And just like the more and more that you put it on and rip it off and more and put it on, rip it off, the less sticky it becomes.

288
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,700
 And candidly, the less painful ripping it off becomes.

289
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,940
 Because internally, just like through sex, more and more sticking, bonding, ripping apart, you just become numb.

290
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:41,780
 And this incredible gift that God gave to be a gift to unify your future marriage or your marriage becomes the gift that you are using to not prepare for marriage, but divorce.

291
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,180
 Where ripping apart from someone is no longer painful and hard and difficult and staying bonded to someone.

292
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,980
 Is no longer easy.

293
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:59,860
 Paul would say it's because sex has permanence every time it happens.

294
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,900
 This is why dating and relationships, it's so dangerous to introduce sex.

295
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,420
 There's a couple of reasons.

296
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,340
 One is because in the stage of dating, you are evaluating.

297
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,060
 You're making the decision like, is this somebody that I want to spend the rest of my life with?

298
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,980
 And when you introduce sex, things get a whole lot muddier.

299
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,740
 It becomes, in other words, much more challenging to evaluate because you know what the Bible says?

300
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
 Everybody knows this is true.

301
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,500
 Sex is intoxicating.

302
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,420
 Proverbs chapter 5 says it's like you're drunk.

303
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,020
 You know what no one would recommend in their life to make good decisions?

304
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,460
 Big life decisions.

305
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,780
 If you had a friend come along and say, you know what?

306
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,500
 I'm trying to decide, should I buy this house?

307
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,220
 Trying to decide, should I take this job?

308
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,380
 I'm trying to decide, should I go back to law school or should I go back to grad school or should I make a decision?

309
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,500
 Should I move places?

310
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,820
 I'm trying to decide, should I invest all of my money in Dogecoin?

311
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,420
 No one would say, whatever your big decision is, I'm gonna go with a no on that last one too, by the way, Dogecoin.

312
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,740
 But whatever your big decision is, no one would say, hey, you know what?

313
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,740
 Here's how I recommend we make that decision.

314
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,540
 Come over to my house.

315
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,620
 I'm gonna bring over some Tito's.

316
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,700
 We're just gonna get hammered and then we're gonna decide, buy the house, go with the Dogecoin, whatever it is.

317
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,980
 Why?

318
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,740
 Because your ability to rightly evaluate diminishes.

319
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:22,860
 In the stage of dating, your ability, when you introduce an intoxicating thing, your ability to rightly evaluate,

320
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,660
 is this person like, do we share the same values?

321
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,980
 Do I want to build a family with them?

322
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,700
 Do I think they're a good husband or a good mother?

323
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,260
 Is this someone I want to be with for the rest of the rest?

324
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,340
 Your ability to evaluate those things goes out the window because it's intoxicating.

325
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,740
 You're not able to see most clearly and candidly and heartbreakingly.

326
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:50,100
 This is why couples who you shouldn't have dated more than three weeks, you stayed together three years because you began to bond.

327
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,140
 And then all of a sudden your lives begin to overlap.

328
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,580
 And then eventually you're like, maybe we should move into each other.

329
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,620
 And you always had these red flags and you were always concerned and you weren't sure that they were the right person.

330
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:07,540
 But you just got so emotionally attached and you begin to think like, oh man, if I hit the ejection button now, you know, maybe there was not gonna be somebody else.

331
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,140
 And something that should have broken up introduced sex to it.

332
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,420
 And that bond became there.

333
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,820
 And that bond came there.

334
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,660
 And every time you thought, maybe I should get out, that sexual union took place.

335
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,180
 And you're like, man, maybe I should.

336
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,820
 And all of a sudden you're living together.

337
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,900
 You got a dog together.

338
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,620
 You're on a Netflix subscription together.

339
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
 And you're like, ah, I don't know if I can.

340
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,060
 And Paul would say, you were dating intoxicated.

341
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,100
 You were dating under the influence of sex.

342
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,460
 Which is never a recipe for evaluating, is this the right person next to?

343
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,580
 Who you're gonna worship is God.

344
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,900
 The decision of who you're gonna marry is the single biggest decision you're gonna make.

345
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,700
 You are picking your family.

346
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,500
 You're picking the father of your children.

347
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,100
 You're picking the grandfather of your grandchildren.

348
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:03,700
 That's not something you want to do under the influence of anything that's gonna inhibit your ability to think clearly.

349
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,140
 And Paul would say, because sex has permanence.

350
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,500
 Sex has permanence.

351
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,940
 And I just want to reiterate, no matter your story, how many times you've ripped off the tape, God is not done.

352
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,180
 He can heal.

353
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,740
 He wants good for you.

354
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:28,060
 And he wants to bring you to a relationship or you to experience the type of marriage and union together that's beyond candidly your wildest dreams.

355
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,460
 So any shame and guilt that you're feeling is not from him.

356
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,420
 But it would be foolish for us to not walk away and go, man, sex has permanence.

357
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,260
 That's not the only thing it has.

358
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,340
 Paul next goes to something else that sex involves.

359
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,740
 He says this, run from sexual sin.

360
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,300
 It's the Greek word porneia and I'll explain what that means in a second.

361
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,380
 He says, no other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does.

362
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:59,340
 Sexual sin or sexual morality is a sin against your own body.

363
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:05,660
 Don't you realize your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who lives in you and was given to you by God?

364
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,340
 You don't belong to yourself.

365
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,780
 God bought you with a price, a very high price, the life of his son.

366
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,580
 So honor God with your body.

367
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,100
 He says some really interesting things there.

368
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,420
 Even if you're not a believer, you've got to at least go, huh, that's an interesting hot take.

369
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,140
 He says no other sin is like sexual sin in the way that it impacts you.

370
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,260
 No other sin brings about the specific consequences that come along with sexual sin.

371
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,940
 All of them different from this unique sin.

372
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,780
 So run from sexual sin or flee, your translation may have there.

373
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,420
 Because sexual sin uniquely impacts you.

374
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,740
 It impacts you at a soul deep level distinct from other sins.

375
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,780
 That's exactly what he says.

376
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,500
 He points out the fact that the temple, the Holy Spirit who lives inside of you.

377
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,260
 In other words, he points out, hey, the temple is not some place you go to.

378
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,340
 If you're in Christ, the temple, you are the temple of God.

379
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,780
 In other words, the temple was a place the presence of God was.

380
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,980
 It was revered. It was amazing.

381
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
 It was set apart.

382
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,860
 And since Jesus came, Paul's saying, no, no, no, no, you're the temple of God.

383
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,380
 He dwells in you if you're a Christian.

384
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,420
 But no other sexual sin, you got to understand this is categorically different.

385
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,140
 The consequences are so different from any other sin.

386
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:17,660
 The second idea from the text is sex has power.

387
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,380
 He uses the word porneia.

388
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,940
 What is porneia? Porneia is a general kind of catch all term for sexual sin of any kind.

389
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:34,020
 Sex before marriage, sexting, oral sex, masturbation, anal sex, sex with animals, gay

390
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,100
 sex, straight sex, any sex outside of marriage.

391
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,860
 Paul says you are playing with something that distinctly impacts and has consequences.

392
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,140
 Be careful with this thing.

393
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,620
 Not because God is against sex.

394
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:52,540
 We're going to get there. That he's all about sex in a specific context.

395
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,660
 But because you're playing with something that is incredibly dangerous.

396
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,420
 In my house, this is a safe.

397
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:06,740
 And this safe is upside, upstairs in our room, in my closet, on a high shelf so that no one can get to it.

398
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,820
 Despite the fact that I'm the only one who knows the code to the safe.

399
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,580
 And the reason why is because in it, it contains a firearm, a gun.

400
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,380
 And that is a gun that I have a very keen awareness is not a bad thing.

401
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:31,420
 Guns can be an incredibly good thing in the hands of somebody or the right person used in the right way to protect, to prevent harm, to prevent crime.

402
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,660
 Can be an incredibly good thing.

403
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:38,860
 But in the hands of a person who doesn't know what they're doing or doesn't know how to use it, it can be an incredibly dangerous thing.

404
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,460
 This gun is revealed back.

405
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,620
 The slide is back.

406
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,220
 There's no magazine inside of it.

407
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,860
 The chamber is cleared.

408
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,340
 There's nothing inside of it.

409
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,340
 And some of you right now are thinking, oh my gosh, what kind of church is this?

410
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,900
 You just said.

411
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,980
 You just gave that whole list of sex and he's got a gun on the safe.

412
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,540
 And if you're uncomfortable, it's it's not crazy because why?

413
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:16,620
 You know, the reverence that you should have and I should have for a loaded, which is not for a gun.

414
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:25,700
 I was out with some friends not long ago and I was took the firearm and took some friends out to the range.

415
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,820
 And I got to say every time that I have that and I'm showing somebody, hey, here's the safety it's on.

416
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,860
 Here's how you shoot it.

417
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,540
 You never pointed any person you pointed away from you.

418
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,420
 You make sure that the chamber, if you're done with it, is loaded.

419
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,460
 I mean, it's empty that they'll do that.

420
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,300
 The safety's on.

421
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,100
 Here's how you turn it on.

422
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,660
 Here's how to turn off.

423
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:49,940
 And I feel like an angst when I'm showing somebody how to shoot it, because I know that incredibly powerful tool.

424
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,020
 That's not bad.

425
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,740
 I know itself.

426
00:28:53,060 --> 00:29:00,300
 But used wrongly can be deadly, can be destructive, can be life altering.

427
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:07,140
 Paul in the Bible speaks, believe it or not, of sex in the same way.

428
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:16,060
 That it can be this incredibly life altering thing, it's not a bad tool at all, but used in the wrong way, in the wrong context by the wrong people.

429
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:21,860
 Can have significant ripples and impacts affecting every part of your life.

430
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,260
 And so use it knowing sex is powerful.

431
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:33,940
 You need to understand, and I understand, sex is this gift that is not bad, but is incredibly powerful in our life.

432
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,940
 I already mentioned the fact that honestly, firsthand, all of us have seen this.

433
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,100
 I can still remember the first sexual encounter that I had with somebody.

434
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,380
 I still know where she was, where we were, the house.

435
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,780
 I still see those moments.

436
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,300
 Why?

437
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,700
 Why can you remember?

438
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,900
 I mean, most of us, you're not like having vivid flashbacks of the first time you smoked weed.

439
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,780
 Or the first time that man, you may have stole something or lied to somebody.

440
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
 You just don't even remember it.

441
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:14,220
 But you can go back to that high school night, college frat party, those moments, and flood back to you.

442
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,260
 We understand sex is not just physical in a world that says, it's just physical.

443
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,340
 It's just two consenting adults.

444
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,100
 It's not that big of a deal.

445
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:28,780
 If that's true, why is some of the biggest shame and guilt that people carry connected to sexuality?

446
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,380
 I've been doing this a long time, 12 years.

447
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,460
 I've sat in front of the stage 12 different years, for 12 years.

448
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,380
 And often somebody will come down front and they'll want to talk and they'll share and they'll just walk through.

449
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,660
 Hey, can I talk to you real quick?

450
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,620
 And they'll do the same thing almost every time.

451
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,740
 Do you mind if you just step over here for a second?

452
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,100
 And I'm like, great.

453
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,140
 Can I talk to you just alone?

454
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,820
 I'll say no.

455
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,180
 I don't ever talk to just people alone.

456
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,540
 But hey, it's my buddy.

457
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:49,980
 He's great.

458
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,420
 You'll love him.

459
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,980
 Let's talk.

460
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,620
 And we'll talk.

461
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,740
 And they always have one thing.

462
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,860
 Every time, it's the same thing.

463
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:06,380
 I've never shared this with anybody, but when I was 12, blank, and it has something to do with sex taking place.

464
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,420
 I've been addicted to pornography since I was 16.

465
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:09,860
 I can't.

466
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,740
 I slept with somebody of the same sex or the opposite sex.

467
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,060
 It always, in other words, every time they've never come up and be like, I just need to get this off my chest.

468
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,900
 I lied about my SAT score to my roommate.

469
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:28,340
 And or, okay, when I was 16, I had, I think, a little bit too much to drink.

470
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,140
 I wouldn't say I was totally wasted, but I was definitely beyond tipsy.

471
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,180
 And I'm not exactly, they never do that.

472
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,980
 I don't carry shame like that.

473
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,620
 I want you to seriously think about it.

474
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,220
 Why?

475
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,260
 Because it impacted them like sex does for all of us.

476
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,500
 It is so level.

477
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,180
 It touches something because God made it that way at the soul.

478
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,860
 This is why, and I want to be really careful.

479
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:05,020
 This is why victims of sexual abuse, and it wasn't your fault, and it was wrong, and God's not done with you.

480
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:12,780
 But if that's part of your story, or you know someone that's a part of their story, they know it's not just physical.

481
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,940
 They didn't even choose to act, and they carry shame and guilt and pain.

482
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
 Why?

483
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:30,100
 If it's just physical, then somebody who's just beat up should carry the same thing.

484
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,140
 Because it's not just physical.

485
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,660
 And they took something from you.

486
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,820
 And it wasn't just physical.

487
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,300
 It was emotional, spiritual, sexual.

488
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:51,460
 We live in a world that lies and knows it's not just physical.

489
00:32:51,460 --> 00:33:05,580
 The Me Too movement and the appropriate energy among sexual predators that took off sparked a wildfire.

490
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:15,100
 Reflects the fact that our world, as crazy and lost as it is, it knows this was not just physical what happened.

491
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,980
 Because it wasn't.

492
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,940
 Because sex has power.

493
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:28,180
 And you need to know, like a firearm, Paul would say, you need to approach it knowing what you're dealing with.

494
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:37,620
 One thing that comes up a lot, and I just want to hit this one last time, and then we're about to move, is people can think that God is like a prude, that he's against sex.

495
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,940
 And you know, he doesn't want it.

496
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,780
 God invented it.

497
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,300
 I'm about to cover that more in depth in a second.

498
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,060
 I want you to think about if you were God, what would you do?

499
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,580
 If you could write the rule book command on, hey, you know what?

500
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,060
 I can have sex with you and have sex with anybody you want, including cows.

501
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,620
 You can do whatever you want at any time in life.

502
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,620
 Or you can say, hey, this just exists for the context of marriage.

503
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,420
 What would you do?

504
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:05,380
 And before you answer that question, I want you to think about all of the pain, all of the cost that sex outside of marriage has caused in your life, your family's life, friend's life, and in our world.

505
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,340
 What do I mean by that?

506
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:12,860
 Think of the number of divorces that have ended because of sexual sin by one person.

507
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,940
 Every year, a million babies are aborted.

508
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:29,060
 The vast, vast, vast majority of those, because the two people who had sex and got pregnant were not married, had no interest in staying together, and did not want that baby.

509
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,420
 That's a million literal lives lost.

510
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,180
 The number of sexually transmitted diseases that is rampant.

511
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,500
 All of these, by the way, do not mean that God is done with you.

512
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,660
 He doesn't want to use you.

513
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,540
 He can't bring healing inside of your life.

514
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:56,940
 But it's clear there's a true cost that happens when you take something that is this incredible gift and you take it outside of the context of marriage.

515
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:15,260
 If you were God and you could wave a magic wand and say, "Hey, this is where sex should take place," knowing all of the damage, the pain, lives ruined or ended because of sex outside of marriage, what would you do?

516
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,860
 Where would you encourage it to take place?

517
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:31,980
 Maybe it now makes sense why God, who's all about sex in the right context, would say, "Hey, this is for two married people to come together and be glued and united and loved.

518
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,900
 And out of that love, life will come."

519
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,340
 But God knows sex has power.

520
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,060
 Last thing on this, and I'm going to move to the last point.

521
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,340
 I hope you get this.

522
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,420
 There's going to be some people you're not going to get it, and it breaks my heart, truly.

523
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,940
 The message of the culture is you need them.

524
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,340
 And some of you guys have parents, and let me tell you what they say if they say this next sentence.

525
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,100
 They're wrong.

526
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,620
 They're fools, honestly.

527
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,140
 And I don't mean that to associate it with your mom and dad.

528
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,060
 I'm sure they're really nice people.

529
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,660
 Love to meet them.

530
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,380
 But they're fools if they say this.

531
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,500
 You need to make sure you're sexually compatible.

532
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
 Here's why.

533
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,180
 Knowing everything the Bible teaches about, hey, you're bonding together with somebody who may not be your spouse.

534
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,900
 You may be preparing better for divorce than for marriage.

535
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,940
 You're playing with something that can be incredibly destructive and dangerous inside of your life.

536
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,060
 And you need to make sure that you're sexually compatible.

537
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,140
 Why would that be a bad idea?

538
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,940
 The myth of sexual compatibility, I think, is one of the most astonishing insanities of our world.

539
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,300
 Because here, I'm going to remove the mystery.

540
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,100
 How do you know if you're sexually compatible with someone?

541
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:38,500
 If you're a guy and you have a penis and she's a woman and she has a vagina, boom, bingo!

542
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,820
 And you may be, now in your mind, you're playing back and forth.

543
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,260
 You're like, "Yeah, but I may have a higher sex drive.

544
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,980
 And we need to make sure that we both have the same amount of sex drive."

545
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,300
 Let me break off a little something for you.

546
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,140
 Your sex drive is going to change, bro.

547
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,060
 So is hers.

548
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,260
 You're going to go through seasons.

549
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,580
 You're going to go through a dark winter after having kids where there ain't no sex for you, bro.

550
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,060
 That's true.

551
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,580
 That's real.

552
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,140
 That's happening.

553
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:03,460
 And so you being like, "Oh, man, are we on the same page, swinging from the chandelier every night?"

554
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,940
 That's not going to be your reality.

555
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:14,580
 And for you to say, "I need to make sure that we're sexually compatible," is like saying, if that's the test, "Hey, you know what?

556
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,220
 We're sexually compatible, so I think we should do that."

557
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,060
 That's like saying, "Hey, we both think sunsets are beautiful.

558
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,580
 You know, I think we should get married."

559
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,940
 That's a terrible reason.

560
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,060
 Why?

561
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,540
 Billions of people think sunsets are beautiful.

562
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,300
 Just like billions of people, literally, you are sexually compatible with.

563
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,180
 There are billions of people, if I may, and I'm not trying to be vulgar, who could bring you to climax.

564
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,980
 Billions.

565
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:45,700
 Does that mean you should marry that person or that is the criteria for getting married?

566
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,580
 No.

567
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,220
 And if you believe that, you're a fool.

568
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,620
 And there's people right now, probably in the YouTube comments and in the Facebook chat, that's like, "No, I heard about a guy and you need to make sure."

569
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
 No, you're a fool.

570
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,500
 You're a fool.

571
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,260
 God created sex and he designed it.

572
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,740
 The reason that parts can work together and I can go 100% confident, man, woman, is because it's true.

573
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,620
 And you're looking for somebody sexually compatible.

574
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,420
 And let me just break it off.

575
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:07,940
 You know what?

576
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,540
 Your marriage or your wedding night, it may not be all like, "Woo, man, fireworks going everywhere."

577
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:27,500
 But you're going to have the rest of your life to grow, to move towards each other, to learn how to pleasure one another, which God is all about in marriage.

578
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,380
 And beforehand, buying the lie of like, "Are we sexually compatible?"

579
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:37,940
 You're fooling yourself if you actually tell yourself you have to find that out.

580
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,540
 And you may not believe me, but you are.

581
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,700
 God doesn't want you to introduce something so powerful, potentially so devastating.

582
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:57,700
 The final reason is because Paul's going to tell us sex has permanence, it has power, and it is something else.

583
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,740
 Verse 1 of chapter 7.

584
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:05,300
 Now, regarding the questions you asked in your letter, so he's responding, he's saying, "You guys wrote me a letter and I'm writing you back."

585
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,740
 Yes, it is good to abstain from sexual relations.

586
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,700
 Whoa, Paul.

587
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,260
 Okay, hard pass on that.

588
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:23,540
 But because, he's not done, and this was right there, that's probably the sentence a lot of you guys grew up in youth group and you believe some version of.

589
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,100
 Like, "Oh, man, sex is bad. Sex is bad."

590
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,700
 That's not what the Bible teaches at all.

591
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,660
 Because sexual morality, because there's so much, every man should have a wife.

592
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,100
 Every woman should have her husband.

593
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:42,700
 The husband, look at this verse, should fulfill his wife's sexual needs.

594
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,660
 The wife should fulfill her husband's needs.

595
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,500
 The wife gives authority over her body to her husband.

596
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,900
 Husband gives authority over his body to his wife.

597
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,780
 I love this next verse.

598
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,660
 Do not deprive one another of sexual relations.

599
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,540
 In other words, headache, no.

600
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,220
 Don't say, "No.

601
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,740
 Hold on, hold on, hold on.

602
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,060
 By the way, when you get married, I would not start with this."

603
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,460
 Speaking from experience.

604
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:22,020
 Unless, unless you both, do not deprive each other sexually.

605
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,980
 This is so freaking gold, man.

606
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:37,220
 Unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so that you can give yourselves more completely to prayer.

607
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:45,860
 Afterwards, you should have sex again so that Satan, come together again, so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

608
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:57,580
 It's basically saying, Paul's saying, and it's not controlling, Paul is basically saying, you need to be servant lovers towards one another and doubting each other's own preferences and wants and serve one another and enjoy sexually.

609
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,300
 But think about that.

610
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,740
 If you came in the room, you think the Bible is proof.

611
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,420
 Paul literally just commanded husbands and wives, you need to have sex.

612
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,700
 Have it often so that nobody is tempted.

613
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,900
 You need to come together.

614
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,340
 You need to serve one another.

615
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:13,060
 You need to prioritize the physical, emotional, sexual needs of your spouse.

616
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,500
 Your body's not yours, it's hers.

617
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,220
 Her body's not hers, it's yours.

618
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,340
 And that's how you both need to come into the relationship and think.

619
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,300
 And I love even his thing.

620
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,220
 The only time, this is crazy, man.

621
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,300
 The only time, there's one occasion why I think it's okay for you not.

622
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,940
 You both mutually agree.

623
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,420
 In other words, you're both like, "Yeah, I think we should.

624
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,580
 We'd like to spend a little more time in prayer."

625
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,780
 That's the only occasion.

626
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,900
 And make sure when you're done, back together.

627
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,460
 That's what the Bible just said.

628
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,140
 Sex is not something God is against.

629
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,780
 Sex is something, it was His idea.

630
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:54,340
 But the third idea, the third point is sex has power, it has permanence, and it has a place.

631
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,740
 And that place is in the context of marriage.

632
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,140
 This may surprise you, may not.

633
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,900
 But further, I want you to just think about it for a second.

634
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,500
 Sex, sex was God's idea.

635
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,580
 It didn't exist.

636
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,500
 And God was like, "Huh, I've been thinking.

637
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,180
 I got a great idea.

638
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,260
 Angels, you're going to love this.

639
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,140
 You guys don't get to do it.

640
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,100
 This is going to be awesome."

641
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,500
 And boom, He created the parts.

642
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,980
 It wasn't like He invented Adam and Eve, walked away, and then one day He was like, "What?

643
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,940
 No. Okay, back off."

644
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,060
 He created it.

645
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,620
 He created the nerve endings where they are.

646
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,220
 The genius idea that was His creation, it's not against that.

647
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:44,260
 It was His idea that two together, and think of the genius of the idea.

648
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,020
 Out of this overflow of love, two people come together and they're so in love.

649
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:58,860
 And out of that overflow of their love and their unity and their sex, life, literally life, a human life, comes out of the overflow of that love.

650
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,820
 It's brilliant.

651
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:07,820
 Even the way that He bonded, we already talked about the oxytocin, all of that, that was God's creation, that it would weave together.

652
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:11,740
 And every time you'd have sex, you're renewing your vows and you're bonded.

653
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:17,780
 And your bond together becomes stronger and stronger and stronger for the rest of your life.

654
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,060
 Even the way, like, let me just be real.

655
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,820
 This happens and this happens when you get married.

656
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,380
 So you get married and this just, it's cannibally, ladies, it's I think part of the brokenness of the fall.

657
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,660
 Like the guy, he's so sweet, at least for me.

658
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,100
 I'm pursuing my wife, we're dating, romance.

659
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,420
 I'm over there, hey, we're going to dinner.

660
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,060
 Every other night, I'm over here writing poems like Romeo.

661
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,180
 We get married.

662
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:44,500
 And it's so quickly easy to not prioritize romancing, pursuing.

663
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:58,300
 And God did something that would turn up the heat of him, of men, knowing like, oh man, I need to romance and care for my wife and pursue her emotionally, relationally, spiritually.

664
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:08,540
 Because God gave me a sex drive that he turned up just a little bit hotter in the men so that they would know, oh, I can't just go about and work on my golf game and be totally fine.

665
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,220
 I need to pursue my wife.

666
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,660
 And every time that I do, we come together, that union gets tighter and stronger and sexually.

667
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,300
 Same thing with her.

668
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:29,340
 That this ingenious, beautiful design, that the two would come together and experience pleasure together, love together, intimacy, connection.

669
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,220
 And out of that overflow, life would come forward.

670
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,860
 And our world has taken it and inverted it.

671
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,860
 That it's not a combination of love.

672
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,300
 It's a combination of self pleasure, it's self desire.

673
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,100
 And it comes together.

674
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,740
 And if life is created, terminated.

675
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,060
 Because that's what Satan, who is, what the Bible says, the enemy does.

676
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,780
 He twists it.

677
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,020
 He takes what is a gift and he twists it.

678
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:58,260
 God says, I'm not against sex, I'm all about it.

679
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,380
 I created it.

680
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,180
 I want you to experience it.

681
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,460
 And let me, I'm about to land the plane and close with this.

682
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:18,340
 If you feel right now like damaged goods and what God has for you is beyond what you could experience because of your past, because of your story, because of your present.

683
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,820
 You also have bought a lie.

684
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,500
 And I want to be bold enough to say this.

685
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:31,580
 Every one of you who's not in a godly covenant marriage, there is a sense in which you are a virgin.

686
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,420
 And I don't mean born again virgin, Sean Lowe style.

687
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,660
 I mean, you have never experienced real sex.

688
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,500
 Stay with me.

689
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,740
 Because you can't.

690
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,620
 Outside of the context of marriage, stay with me.

691
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,260
 I mean, every word that I'm about to say is very, very important.

692
00:45:50,260 --> 00:46:00,580
 I'm talking the type of real sex God gave as a gift that can only happen in the context of marriage.

693
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,620
 Between one man and one woman who come together and say, I covenant my life to you.

694
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,300
 I know everything messed up about you.

695
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,060
 You're not perfect.

696
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,660
 You're broken.

697
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,700
 You had a sexual past.

698
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,660
 I'm not going anywhere.

699
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,620
 We are going to be naked and unashamed.

700
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,340
 I'm going to love you.

701
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,980
 I'm going to serve you.

702
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,940
 I'm going to prioritize you.

703
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,940
 I won't do it perfectly, but I'm here for you and I'm going to serve you.

704
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,460
 And on the other side, she's going, I know your past.

705
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,020
 I know everything broken, everything messed up.

706
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,940
 I'm not going anywhere.

707
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,940
 And we're covenanting our lives together.

708
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,300
 We're going to walk through the highs and the lows, the valleys and the mountaintops together.

709
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,100
 And we're going to love each other and be naked and unashamed.

710
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,340
 That's the type of real sex.

711
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,940
 I'm talking Garden of Eden style, Song of Solomon sex.

712
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:47,220
 And if you have never been married in a covenant relationship with a person who loves Jesus like you love Jesus imperfectly, but is committed to that covenant coming together, you have never had real sex.

713
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,140
 I don't care how many chandeliers you swung from.

714
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,180
 You haven't had it.

715
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,940
 Because let me be clear, you can't.

716
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,820
 You can have a one night hookup.

717
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,900
 You can have a banging body and be amazing in your own eyes in bed.

718
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,980
 But you haven't had real sex.

719
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,820
 Like it was created, designed, intended to be.

720
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,180
 And there's still hope and there's still an opportunity for you to pursue that.

721
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:19,980
 But the more damage that you and I do as it relates to playing with something that is so powerful, can be so damaging, is only going to get in the way.

722
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:26,140
 If you don't take this season, say, God, I'm going to surrender even my sexuality to you.

723
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,860
 I'm going to surrender my life.

724
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,620
 I'm going to trust your way.

725
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:35,140
 I'm going to use sex or see it as a gift that is intended for the context of marriage.

726
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,540
 And I'm going to trust you with that.

727
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:42,540
 And I'm gonna allow you to come in and work through and bring healing to everything broken inside of my life.

728
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,940
 My kids love this Etch A Sketch.

729
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,900
 I love playing with an Etch A Sketch.

730
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,060
 This one is one that Ramsey went out and bought today.

731
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,980
 So I couldn't take away my two year olds.

732
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,820
 But this is an Etch A Sketch.

733
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,140
 And something happened with a two year old when they played with an Etch A Sketch.

734
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,380
 Etch A Sketch, if you didn't grow up in America, is this thing where you twist the knobs and different lines come up.

735
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:15,980
 And in a real way, what happens inside of you see a two year old messing with going around with the Etch A Sketch is they're not able to kind of logically reason like how to create anything other than squiggly lines and damage and everything's chaotic and out of control.

736
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,820
 And so she'll come to me, the two year old, and she'll bring it and be like, hey, can you shake it?

737
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,100
 Because she also didn't have enough strength to shake it and start it new.

738
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:31,020
 And a lot of ways our sexual lives are like the mess and the chaos that got woven and you were introduced to pornography at age 12.

739
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:39,500
 And then all of a sudden at 16, there was a girl and man, you didn't go all the way, but you went as far as she would let you go.

740
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:44,140
 And it was oral sex, and that was a part of your story.

741
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,260
 And then all of a sudden you got into high school and it was a girl that you were like, man, I feel like we're in love.

742
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,780
 And culture says, you know, whenever you're ready.

743
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,900
 And I feel like I was born ready.

744
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,780
 So we're going to have sex.

745
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,580
 And you had sex.

746
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,780
 And all along the journey, there was all these different moments that make up.

747
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:05,460
 The twists and turns and the baggage and the pain and the shame and the parts of your story.

748
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,860
 What God is inviting you to do tonight.

749
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:21,900
 And it may be the best step that you can give to yourself, to your future spouse is to say, I am going to surrender my sexuality, all the turns, all the brokenness, all the chaos, all the messes, everything that I've given.

750
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,300
 And I want to give it to you, God.

751
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:30,860
 Because I believe that what you say is true, that you are the only one who could take it and you could shake it and you can make it right.

752
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,740
 And you can make what looks so chaotic disappear.

753
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,100
 And you can bring order.

754
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,660
 You can restore all the different brokenness that exists inside of my heart.

755
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:44,540
 And you can bring to life.

756
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,780
 And I believe that is true.

757
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,140
 And I'm going to trust you with my marriage.

758
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,460
 I'm going to trust you with my future.

759
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,340
 I'm going to trust you with whatever you have for me.

760
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,460
 And I'm asking that you would help me heal.

761
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,780
 Because some of you guys, you need to heal from sexual past.

762
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,500
 You need to heal from parts of your story that you have never told anybody.

763
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:07,700
 But they're part of your story that is impacting you and is going to impact your marriage unless you deal with it.

764
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:20,500
 And bring it to the God who wants to take that brokenness and replace all the shame, replace it with his love.

765
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,900
 And restore what was taken from you.

766
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,260
 And redefine your past.

767
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,740
 Erase the sexual sin.

768
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,420
 He's not done with you.

769
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:41,260
 This passage starts in a way that is so profound to me.

770
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:44,180
 First Corinthians chapter 6.

771
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,460
 It starts by saying this at the end.

772
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:56,940
 Those who indulge in sexual sin will not inherit the kingdom of God.

773
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:02,020
 Wait. What are you saying, Paul?

774
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,740
 You're about to write to a bunch of guys and men and women who are sleeping with prostitutes and you say that's sexual sin.

775
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,340
 Not to do it.

776
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,300
 Some of you were once like that.

777
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,660
 But you were cleansed.

778
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:18,660
 You were made holy.

779
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,300
 You were made right with God.

780
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,620
 By living a good life.

781
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,380
 By dating rightly.

782
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,500
 By calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God.

783
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,620
 Paul writes to a group of people sleeping with prostitutes.

784
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,220
 Think about that.

785
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,780
 Hey guys, stop sleeping with prostitutes.

786
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,860
 But before he goes there, he says, some of you were marked by sexual sin.

787
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,300
 Not are, more.

788
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,900
 But you were washed.

789
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,940
 You were cleansed.

790
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,340
 Not because of your behavior, but by calling on the name of Jesus Christ.

791
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,860
 You're not defined by those things.

792
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,460
 All of your sexual dysfunction has been replaced and defined by the cross.

793
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,500
 And you were cleansed.

794
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,380
 You were made right.

795
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,020
 You were washed pure as snow.

796
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,540
 The Bible says those things that flooded you or have flooded you in the last 45 minutes of all shame and guilt.

797
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,860
 Those do not come from him.

798
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,940
 And he's not condoning your sin and saying, man, just keep sleeping around.

799
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:20,700
 He's calling you to be who you are as a follower of Christ.

800
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,980
 Set apart.

801
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,500
 Holy.

802
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,860
 Righteous.

803
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,740
 Clean.

804
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:35,100
 The word pornea is a word that its origins come from.

805
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,420
 Remember I said pornea is the word for sexual sin.

806
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,820
 You know the origin of that word comes from?

807
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:46,700
 It comes from to sell yourself in exchange for something that's not as valuable as you.

808
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:57,220
 Which is so beautiful if you think of the context in which Paul takes that word and he says, you are so valuable.

809
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,780
 You were bought at a high price, the price of Christ himself on the cross.

810
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,860
 That's how valuable you are.

811
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,340
 No matter how much shame you feel, no matter how many people you've been with.

812
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:08,220
 You're so valuable to God that he would give his own life for you.

813
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:18,660
 Don't sell yourself short or exchange your body for something that's less valuable than you are.

814
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:26,420
 And your value, no matter your story, no matter your past, is beyond words I could describe because it is the life of Christ.

815
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,380
 It's how much you mean to God.

816
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:35,620
 And tonight, he's calling all of us in whatever way and to whatever degree to surrender our sexuality.

817
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,740
 Maybe confess something we've never shared before to experience healing.

818
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,020
 Maybe to just say, you know what, we're breaking this relationship off.

819
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,420
 Well, you know what?

820
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:49,900
 Hey, we're going to bring in community because we've been pushing physical boundaries and it's not honoring to God.

821
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:57,460
 I don't know what the step is, but whatever that step is, if you decide to take it, you have the courage.

822
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:09,820
 You take that step and you're giving a gift to you, your future spouse, a gift that leads to life, that honors God,

823
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:16,860
 and that leads to a future that's better than whatever step you would take if you don't take that one.

824
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,900
 Let me pray.

825
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:25,580
 Father, thank you that you do not define us by our sin, our past.

826
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:39,380
 You look in the eyes of people who are sexually ignorant, foolish, self-harming, and you call them cleansed, holy, righteous.

827
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:45,180
 I pray that any shame felt in this room would not be as big as you are.

828
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,980
 Sex has power, but you're more powerful.

829
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,740
 Sex is permanence, but you are more permanent.

830
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,420
 Sex has a place and every person here has a place with you.

831
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:02,820
 I pray that you would heal open wounds and turn them into scars, open sexual pasts and turn them into scars,

832
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:09,220
 that people won't walk around carrying an open wound of pain, but a scar that they tell of how God,

833
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,860
 even through the most broken part of our past, was at work and is good and has brought healing.

834
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:20,700
 I pray for anyone who's never trusted in you, God, that they will not inherit the kingdom of God.

835
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,020
 They're not clothed by holiness, righteous, and all the attributes that don't come from our behavior.

836
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,500
 They come from calling on the name of the Lord.

837
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,380
 Tonight would be their night.

838
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,580
 We worship you in song.
