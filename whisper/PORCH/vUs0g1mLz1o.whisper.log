[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:26.780]   Let's go.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.960]   >> [APPLAUSE] >> What's up, friends in the room?
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.600]   Friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, Northwest Arkansas, Phoenix,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.320]   wherever you're listening in from.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.360]   We are continuing this mood series tonight.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480]   Anyone ever been in a relationship with someone where you feel like
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.840]   they're not trying as hard as you are?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.400]   >> [APPLAUSE] >> [LAUGH]
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.240]   Hopefully it's not the person you're here with tonight.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.440]   >> [LAUGH] >> But I recently had this, and
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.840]   I'm not even talking necessarily in a dating relationship,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.880]   I'm talking about a friendship.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.280]   A friend of mine, man, you guys have some stuff to vent.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.600]   >> [LAUGH] >> A friend of mine recently,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.200]   not long ago, moved up and took a position of a pastor in Fort Worth.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.840]   And my best friend in the world was the best man at my wedding, really close.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.080]   And have just college roommates, spent so much time together.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.520]   And ever since he's moved up there, it's just been that we've missed having
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.320]   to be able to connect.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440]   And I have felt at times, dude,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.760]   I feel like I'm trying harder in this thing than you are, what is the deal?
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.800]   Recently there was a concert that I'd gotten tickets for him and his wife,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.240]   joined me and my wife, let's go to it.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.200]   And kinda at the last minute he had to bail.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.920]   And then the series of phone tags just continued to take place.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.120]   And there was a shower that we threw and hosted for a mutual friend of ours, and
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.200]   they couldn't come to that either.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   And it just felt like one thing after the next.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.680]   And at some point last week, I just kinda had this breaking point where I
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   left him a message.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.800]   It basically was like, hey dude, I feel like there's something going on, or
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.560]   you're not trying as hard in this relationship right now, what's the deal?
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.200]   And then the next couple days go by and don't really hear anything.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   And then at some point got a phone call, couldn't call him back.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.640]   And it's kinda the end of the week by this point.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.880]   And I'm thinking like, man, I am starting to feel all kinds of just frustration,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.480]   like what is the deal, bro?
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.360]   I feel like I thought we were boys and we have not been able to hang.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.560]   And I feel like, what is the deal?
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.120]   And Father's Day rolls around, and little did I know that our wives
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.760]   were totally unaware of this.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.960]   And they had planned kind of a special day of like, no,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.400]   here's what we're gonna do to celebrate.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.600]   We're gonna let them, we'll take the kids, and we'll let them go hang out and
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.240]   go to the batting cages, go to Topgolf, and go do all this stuff.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.960]   So my Father's Day surprise was, hey, conflict resolution.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.000]   And so get a chance to go and hang out with him.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.760]   But really what had happened in that situation was some hurt had festered
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   inside of my life, and it began to turn into an anger or resentment.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.920]   And I'll come back to that story in a second.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   And it began to create this kind of like, honestly, as I was told,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   he's coming over to do batting cages.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.040]   Part of me was going, I don't even know that I wanna go do Topgolf and
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.880]   batting cages right now.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.800]   That doesn't sound like fun.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.280]   It sounds like we need to work through some stuff before we do that.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   And it began to create this wall that started with a hurt,
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.040]   that turned into anger, that began to turn into resentment.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   And I start with that story tonight, and I'll pick up that story and
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.200]   finish it here in a second, because we're continuing this mood series, and
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.880]   we are covering the topic of anger, covering the emotion of anger.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.080]   Oftentimes, anger starts with hurt, and it turns into that.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.040]   But like few emotions that you're gonna have in life,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.880]   the power of anger to impact your relationships is tremendous.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.560]   It is the ability to destroy relationships.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.360]   It is the reason why some of you don't talk to your parents,
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.720]   some of you don't talk to old friends from high school.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.200]   Some of you switched best friends in high school or
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.440]   college like nine different times because anger or hurt turned into anger and
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.320]   then turned into resentment.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.000]   And so we're gonna cover what God's word says about this topic.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.280]   Now, just to loop everybody in, in case you're like, dude,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.480]   we're talking about anger, this feels so not relevant to me.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.080]   Is this just relevant to the guy who goes home, he's angry,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.440]   punches holes in the wall, the Hulk, basically, the rage man?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.940]   No.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.600]   Anger is one of those emotions that, I mean, it can lead us at times to have
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.640]   explosions, but there's others of us in the room that we don't act out in
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.000]   aggression, you act out in passive aggression.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And you act out in not explosions, but this implosion on the inside.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.960]   Some of the most angry people on the face are like, everything's fine,
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.680]   this is great, I hate them, I hate all of them.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.120]   That's how some of you express your anger.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.640]   And it's just this internal dialogue.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.000]   We show the feelings wheel this first week, particularly for the guys,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.320]   by the way, this is not in your Bible.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.360]   This is totally just a helpful tool, take it or leave it.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.320]   But you'll see inside of that, of the idea of anger,
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.640]   it's connected to all kinds of these different sub-emotions that can be
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.160]   connected to.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.280]   In other words, you could be angry, it could look like, man,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.720]   I'm humiliated right now.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.280]   You could be angry and just feel like I was really disrespected in that moment.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.480]   It can lead you to be critical of others, it can lead to jealousy,
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.920]   it can lead to all these types of different emotions.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.840]   So we're going to cover what God's Word says about anger.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.920]   And in case you're wondering, does this really apply to me?
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.040]   Here's some scenarios where it's a likelihood or a good chance that you
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.920]   are angry.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.760]   Is there anyone inside of your life that you would just be a little bit happy if
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.040]   things weren't going great in their life?
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.800]   Like if they failed or they didn't get the promotion or they didn't get that new
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.360]   car or their boyfriend broke up with them, you would be like, "Oh,
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.800]   I'm so sorry."
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.400]   Yes.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.120]   You probably have some hurt that has turned into anger or resentment in their
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.600]   life.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.880]   Is there anyone in your life that their name, they're like Voldemort,
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.240]   it is the name that shall not be named.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.400]   You bring it up and it's like, "I can't, I don't even want to talk about this
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.840]   person right now.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.280]   I thought you knew that we're not good, okay?"
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.200]   You probably have some anger or hurt that's turned into resentment.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.400]   Is there anyone you would avoid in public because if something happened,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   something that happened between you?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.920]   Is there anyone that you're waiting to let back into your life to have a
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.040]   relationship and you won't let them back in until they apologize?
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.920]   There's probably some hurt that has turned into anger and is impacting life.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.520]   Do you often battle lots of thoughts in your mind going on?
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.360]   Will you just find yourself trapped in like, "What are they thinking about me?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.320]   I'm prone to negatively interpreting what they're thinking."
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.560]   There could be some anger that's turned into resentment in your life.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.960]   Are you prone to keep all of your feelings to yourself?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.160]   There could be some anger and resentment that's taking place there.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.280]   All of them may be reflections that there's anger going on below the surface.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.560]   And so the last thing I would say is unlike very few emotions, this one will
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.520]   hurt your relationships now, will impact your future marriage that you're going to
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.280]   have your ability to resolve and work through resentment and hurt and anger and
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.120]   prevent it from becoming bitterness, and really impact the rest of the
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.720]   trajectory of your life, your work environment, your overall relational
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.600]   satisfaction, ability to keep relationships with friends.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.600]   So we're going to look at what the Bible says as it looks to the source of our
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.120]   anger, some of the side effects that the Bible says, "Hey, if you allow anger to be
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.720]   a part of your life in any way, these are the things that are going to take place."
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.280]   And then the solution that God really clearly lays out in the New Testament as
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.800]   it relates to dealing with our anger.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.720]   So the first, let's cover, it comes from Matthew, Mark chapter 7, verse 21.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:19.680]   Jesus says this, "For it is within and out of a person's heart that evil thoughts come."
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.920]   Jesus says, "Okay, the evil thoughts that you have, the evil thoughts that lead to
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.960]   actions, those don't flow from external circumstances, those flow from your heart."
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.840]   What type of evil thoughts or actions?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.960]   Sexual morality, theft, murder.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.200]   What do you mean murder is a thought?
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.280]   Yeah, anger can lead you to a place where you begin to think of like, "Man, I just
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.040]   wish they were not in my life to the point of murder."
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.560]   Adultery, greed, malice, which is just a word for being mean towards someone.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.600]   Deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, which is just talking bad about somebody.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.480]   Arrogance and folly.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.800]   All of these evils come from inside and defile a person.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.120]   The first idea that really I want to camp out and talk about for a little bit, and this
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.880]   is so huge, is the source of the sinful anger in your life comes from your heart.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.080]   Particularly two places.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.680]   From the fact that every single one of us has a sinful heart, the Bible says.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.640]   And then the other place that it comes from is just hurts that get lodged.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.640]   But when I say sinful anger, let me explain what I mean, why I even have that included
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.640]   in there.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.120]   If you take notes, the first idea is that source of your sinful anger is your heart.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.200]   When I say this, let me qualify by saying the Bible does not say anger is a sin.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.800]   It says anger is an emotion that was given to us like every emotion by God, and it is
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.520]   possible to be angry and not sin.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.080]   God was angry.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.160]   There is such a thing as righteous anger.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.760]   But for the purpose of really the next 25 minutes, I'm gonna focus in on sinful anger
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.960]   because I've never met somebody who's like, "I feel like the biggest problem in my world
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.640]   is too much righteous anger.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.520]   That's leading me to do all kinds of godly things."
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.560]   That just isn't usually the types of conversations that I get into.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.720]   So we're gonna focus on sinful anger.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.400]   And that sinful anger, you can trace the source, the Bible says, all the way directly to your
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   heart.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.920]   That if you just focus on your external behavior, you're not addressing the root of the problem.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.560]   That's what I mean by these sinful areas of the heart is sinful and it can lead to anger
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   expressing itself.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.640]   Sometimes it looks like selfishness.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.520]   The reason why if you have road rage, you're angry is because there's something in your
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.120]   heart and there's a selfishness that, "Hey, get out of my way.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.720]   I wanna get where I wanna get on time, and I just get so angry about it."
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   There's a selfishness.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.320]   There's a sinful aspect of your heart that leads you to anger.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.720]   Another way that it can flesh itself out is entitlement.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.880]   Some of you are angry at God because you feel entitled to being further along in your job,
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.720]   in a different city altogether, in a married relationship, in any relationship, and you
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.600]   have this anger because it results or it's coming from a sinful entitlement that you
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   have.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.960]   Envy can lead us to anger.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.000]   We look around in comparison and feel like, "Man, everyone else has the things that I
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.640]   should have and I'm angry about it.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.640]   I'm angry at them.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'm angry at God."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.520]   Stress and the need for approval from others can be a huge trigger for anger.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.560]   That is the biggest trigger in my life for anger is I can feel overwhelmed and stressed
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.220]   about things that at the source or root of that, I'm really just like worried about what
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:09.360]   other people are thinking about me, how successful or how impressive that I am in life.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.040]   If I can't accomplish those things, it can lead to anger because there's a sinful part
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.040]   of my heart.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   I'm going to tell you why that's so important.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.400]   The second area is not just the fact that all of us come into this room with a broken
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.840]   heart that when sin entered the world, it entered the human heart.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.800]   You can trace back all the anger and sinful expressions of it to the heart, but you can
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.160]   also trace it to the fact that along the journey of life, there will be people that hurt us
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.240]   and do things to us, and inside of that hurt, it can get lodged if it's not dealt with in
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:42.200]   a healthy way, that hurt from somebody betraying us, somebody lying to us, somebody doing something
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.600]   that just hurts us, it can get lodged into our heart, and it becomes something where
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.960]   it turns eventually into anger, it turns into resentment, and we begin to hold it against
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   those people.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.240]   In Hebrews 12, verse 15, it says this, "See to it that no one falls short of the grace
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:05.600]   of God, and that no bitter root or the root of bitterness grows up and causes trouble
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.480]   and defiles many."
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.000]   The Bible says that the root or the bitterness, bitterness can be like a root inside of your
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   life.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It's such a genius analogy because what's a root?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.200]   It's something that's below the surface that even though you can't see it on the outside,
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.800]   it's impacting what's above the surface.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.800]   And the Bible says that if you allow it, if you allow it hurts from other people in your
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.400]   life and you don't handle them God's way, we'll talk about that, that it becomes like
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.160]   this root, that it grows, and even though not everyone can see exactly what's underneath,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.240]   it's impacting what's above and on the surface, and it leads us to lash out, to respond in
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.640]   anger, to wall off, and shed other people out of our life.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.440]   The two areas that really the source of the anger inside of your life, or resentment,
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.400]   or bitterness, or any of those different things, comes from the heart just being sinful, and
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:58.760]   from hurt and harboring hurt inside of your heart, and undealt with hurt grows.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.680]   Anger is a signal that there is something there that should be addressed.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.720]   There's two types, let me explain it kind of this way.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.440]   There's two types of people as it relates to a very specific thing, and that is something
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.720]   called the check engine light in your car.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.080]   When I get in my wife's car, or my wife's car not long ago, I got into it, and in the
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.640]   car we were driving along, and all of a sudden the check engine light was on, and I was like,
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.760]   "The check engine light is on.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.760]   Do you know that?
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   Have you known that?"
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.480]   And she was like, "Oh yeah, it's been on for a while."
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.080]   Some of you in the room are kind of like my wife, where you're like, "Oh yeah, it's fine.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.680]   It basically is like I'm low on gas.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.840]   I'll fix it at some point.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.120]   I'm sure everything's fine."
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.560]   And then there's others of us who are like, "The check engine light is on.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   The car could totally shut down.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.440]   Like you may have an oil tank, it could total the car.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   Do you know that?
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.800]   Do you guys know that?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.200]   That's just for free."
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.280]   And either way, whatever perspective you have on that, here's what we all agree on.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.460]   The check engine light is a signal that there's something below the surface or beneath the
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.920]   hood that needs to be addressed.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.840]   That's why it's on.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.440]   Human emotions, we've said, and anger in particular, is a signal to you and to me.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.320]   Every time you feel a human emotion, if you get nothing else out of this entire series,
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   it should be this.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.920]   Hopefully a lot more, but at least this.
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.800]   Every time you feel something, and anger, for example, should be a signal to you, there's
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.120]   something going on inside of my heart that I need to address.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.960]   That you need to learn the art of whenever you're feeling something, like why, beginning
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.180]   to wonder and ask, "Why am I feeling what I'm feeling?
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.180]   What is going on?
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.320]   What is the check engine light, which is this emotion, telling me?
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.280]   And why am I feeling the way that I'm feeling?"
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.800]   Learning the skill, if you will, of monitoring your heart.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.000]   What do I mean by monitoring your heart?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.080]   Here's like what society will help us do.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.160]   Everyone in this room has been raised to monitor their behavior.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.080]   And from very early on, you were taught, "Hey, monitor your behavior if you want to be successful
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080]   in life at all."
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.280]   At elementary school, it's like, "Hey, if you're good, you get to put the green sticker
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   on.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   If you're bad, you don't.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.920]   If you move on to middle school and you get demerits, if you don't behave, you're gonna
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   get in trouble."
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.920]   Everyone's taught to monitor their behavior.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   In fact, as a society, we have really collectively said, "You're gonna learn to monitor your
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.940]   behavior or we're gonna monitor it for you."
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.600]   And that thing is called prison.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.460]   Because in prison, you no longer get to choose your behavior anymore.
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.520]   And so if you can't learn to monitor your behavior, we're gonna put you in prison.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.960]   And so many of us, most of us, we kind of learn not to just follow every instinct that
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.160]   we have and to kind of check and monitor our behavior.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:27.900]   But rarely do people learn to monitor your heart, to stop and say, "Why am I feeling
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.640]   what I'm feeling?"
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.840]   When I was waiting for my friend at, you know, that Topgolf, I was sitting there beginning
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.240]   to dress and beginning to go, "Man, why am I feeling like this right now?
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.700]   What is going on inside of my heart that makes me feel this way?
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.080]   I feel like I'm trying harder than he is and maybe it's because I've placed unrealistic
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.300]   expectations on him.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.700]   He's got a ton going on.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.020]   He's got little kids.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.460]   Is there something that I have done to place unrealistic expectations?
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.980]   And I think that also I've associated quickness and response time to intimacy in a relationship
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.340]   or closeness in a relationship.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.260]   Like, what is going on beneath the surface?"
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.480]   Anytime you feel anger, frustration, resentment, that should be a signal to you, there's something
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.440]   going on there.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.160]   Some of you, there are men and women, you don't like women or you are resentful towards
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.420]   women or you look down on women.
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.220]   You should go, "What is that inside of me?"
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.440]   There are women in the room and you're angry and bitter towards men and that resentment
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.340]   should signal to you, "What is going on in my heart?"
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.000]   When you get angry at your boss, when you get angry in a dating scenario, when any emotion
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.780]   comes on its own, learning the heart of the going, "What is going on inside of my heart?
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.540]   What would God's Word say about this emotion?
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.180]   What are the lies that I'm beginning to believe?
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.460]   What are the things in general I'm believing?"
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.660]   And addressing those by monitoring your heart.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.580]   If you get nothing else, the skill of going, "Hey, every time you feel something, that
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.140]   should be a signal to you.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.260]   There's something going on underneath the hood or underneath and in the heart that needs
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.380]   to be addressed and aligned with God's Word."
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.380]   Involving community.
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.580]   If you have a community group, which hopefully you do, involving them if you're at a place
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.240]   where like, "I don't know exactly what I'm feeling or why I'm feeling what I'm feeling
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.920]   right now."
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.340]   Because if you fail to address at a heart level what you're feeling, you're failing
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.020]   to address the root of what you're feeling.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.860]   And the root will lead you to why you're feeling it.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.420]   So the first thing you've got to know if you're going to have any victory inside of this and
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   really emotions in general is that the source of sinful anger comes from the heart.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.380]   Second thing comes from Matthew chapter 5, where Jesus further talks on this topic and
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.300]   he says this.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   Starting in verse 21.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.360]   "You've heard it said," it's in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount, and he's teaching
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.640]   basically Jesus' first sermon ever and he launches into several topics, one of them
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   being anger.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.440]   "You've heard it said long ago, 'You shall not murder.'
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.600]   And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.360]   But I tell you that anyone who is angry," or your translation may say, "angry in the
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:57.720]   heart with a brother or a sister will be subject to judgment."
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.000]   Jesus says, "Hey, everyone thinks it's the standard.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.680]   As long as you don't murder somebody, you're good.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.880]   And I've come and I'm telling you that the standard is not murder.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.160]   The standard is you being angry.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.120]   If you hold on to anger in your heart, you are just as liable and subject to judgment
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.880]   as the person who's murdered."
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   And then he says this.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:20.680]   "Therefore," verse 23, "if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.280]   that your brother or sister has something against you, that there's something between
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.160]   you two, leave your gift there in front of the altar.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:34.800]   First go and be reconciled to them and then come and offer your gift at the altar."
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.200]   So Jesus says, "Hey, look, if you are sitting in church and you're sitting there and you're
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.600]   raising your hands and you're like, 'This is how I fight my battles,' or there's another
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.360]   in the fire and he hits you, oh man, I've got some beef with him, with her.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.960]   I'm holding something against a Christian brother or sister that you should put your
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   hands down.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   You should walk out.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.960]   You should call them.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.640]   You should attempt to address the scenario or attempt to be reconciled to them."
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.160]   Think about how crazy that is.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:06.120]   The God who's there says, "Hey, you can't be okay here vertically unless you are okay
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:13.220]   horizontally and I want you," like think about this, "to prioritize your horizontal relationships
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.220]   before me."
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.520]   In other words, you can't be right and you can't have this being the priority of your
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.280]   life if you are not okay with other brothers and sisters who are Christians.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.360]   So I want you to go and first be reconciled to them because anytime that you allow anger
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.620]   to sit inside of your heart, it creates a wall in your relationships, creates damage
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.800]   in your relationships to one another and God says it walls you off from him.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.360]   First address them before you come and deal with me.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.920]   The second point, if you take note, so we're just talking about is the side effect of sinful
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.000]   anger is harmed relationships.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Harmed relationships.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.800]   Every time that anger sits and it's not dealt with in the right way, it turns into bitterness
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.240]   and it always puts a barrier up, it always hurts the relationships.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.800]   Maybe for you this looks like with a parent, like we've all experienced this in so many
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:03.000]   different ways, we just talk for hours about examples and illustrations, where we get hurt
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.980]   and it turns to anger and we begin to put barriers, we begin to kind of keep them at
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.120]   a distance because I'm gonna begin to wall that up.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.160]   Maybe it was with a parent and you have a dad who walked out and divorced your mom or
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.620]   you have a mom who walked out and left your family and that created hurt and it's turned
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.920]   into an anger and you kind of begin to keep them at a distance.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.440]   Maybe you have a resentment or an anger towards a parent, you're like dude, my dad, he never
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.040]   came to my sports games all throughout growing up and that hurt has turned into an anger
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   and a resentment.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.680]   Maybe you have just parents, you're like dude, nothing was ever good enough for them.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.480]   Everything that I did, they had these unrealistic expectations, it was exhausting and it hurt
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.720]   and I'm angry about it and you don't even realize it.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.780]   None of this happens consciously where we're like and now I'm choosing to be angry about
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.780]   it.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:55.940]   It just sits there and it begins to place a barrier relationally between the two of
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.940]   us.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.540]   Maybe it's with a boss at work and you just feel disrespected all the time.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.220]   You just feel like man, I'm hurt by that and now I'm angry and now I don't even want to
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.940]   work for this person, I'm looking at LinkedIn all the time.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.460]   When I go to job, that's what I do.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.060]   They disrespected you, maybe they dismissed your idea in front of everyone.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.760]   Maybe they gave the promotion to the guy who's only been there for six months, you're like
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.840]   I've been here for three years, are you serious?
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.680]   And it's created a hurt that's led to an anger and it's created a barrier and a distance.
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:30.240]   Anytime that hurt is undealt with or is not dealt with in God's way, it creates, it hurt
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.880]   turns into an anger, it turns into a bitterness and that bitterness begins to build a wall.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:40.760]   It's like this, anytime that there is a giant blanket on the stage and a platform, okay,
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:47.280]   watch out, it's like in our relationships, every time that somebody hurts us, we begin
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.000]   to build a wall and it's a wall that separates us from them.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.720]   So some of you guys have like friendships and I mean, you've like switched around with
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.380]   friends so many different times because as it relates to them being your friend, they've
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.560]   just hurt you and you don't even realize it and each time they hurt you, you didn't address
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.480]   it, you didn't talk about it, you didn't bring it to them, you didn't extend forgiveness,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.960]   you were like I'm just gonna hold on to that.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.440]   This is just the type of person you are.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.960]   So I can't believe that you didn't invite me on that vacation with all of my friends
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   and it doesn't even fit in there and I'm angry about it and you got to go and you're like,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.800]   oh, I didn't know that you liked the beach.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.120]   Who doesn't like the beach?
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.120]   Are you serious?
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.560]   And you went without me and you deserted me.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.960]   And then I found out that, you know, I wasn't even included in your wedding party and you're
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.040]   getting engaged so you got engaged, you're gonna get married and I'm not just not a bridesmaid,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.480]   I'm not even in the house party.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.160]   You serious?
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   Not the house party?
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   That's like the B-level bridesmaids.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.160]   I didn't even make that.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.960]   If you're not from Texas and you're listening in, house party, it's like the B-level bridesmaids.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.360]   Still gotta buy a dress but it's kind of like we're close but not that close.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.120]   I'm not even in that and you begin to build the bricks and you're like, I can't believe
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   you don't even follow me on Instagram.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   This is ridiculous.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:54.320]   You don't even know that I'm dating someone now 'cause you don't follow me on Instagram
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.920]   and I am just upset and I begin to put these bricks in place and one by one, I just decide,
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   hey, I'm not gonna have any relationship.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.600]   And then I heard that you talked bad about me that one time and I'm getting out of breath
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.240]   and I'm like, these bricks, oh golly.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.760]   It is heavy to carry bitterness around and bitterness, I act like that was planned and
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.160]   just one by one by one.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.720]   In fact, you didn't text me back.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.400]   I texted you about having dinner plans this past weekend and I know that you saw it 'cause
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   I saw the little dots pop up and I know it was there.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.080]   And you know, the last time that we hung out, I paid for your meal and you didn't Venmo
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.080]   me.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:35.640]   It was only eight bucks but it's the principle of the thing and my birthday came up, you
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:46.600]   didn't even wish me happy birthday and all of a sudden, I start jogging.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:53.200]   One by one, that bitterness is like bitter bricks and it creates a wall.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:23:00.120]   And the sad and crazy thing is that on the other side of that wall is not just your friend
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.560]   or not just your parent or not just a coworker, God says, you can put me over there too.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.840]   Because the intimacy that you're gonna have with me is gonna always be hindered until
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.640]   you get right with them.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.720]   This is what I mean by like some of us, we just have friends that we've gotten so good
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.400]   at building up walls and hey, if you do me wrong, like I'm done with you.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.240]   And so we just move on and we don't talk to them for another six months.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.560]   We don't talk to them for another couple years and then all of a sudden, that roommate that
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.000]   I was so close with, man, they kind of betrayed me.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.560]   I'm upset about that dating thing that happened and now we just don't talk anymore.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.440]   Because one by one, and the crazy thing about this is like these get easier to put up every
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.720]   single time.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.760]   All of a sudden, you're like, man, of course you don't call me back.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.160]   You don't even think about this, it's just kind of who you are.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.440]   And even more dangerous, some of us have friends and they will help us build the wall.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.160]   They will help us be like, yes, they don't ever call you back.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.720]   That's just the type of person that they are.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.400]   Put another one on there.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.680]   And it is tragic.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.560]   And Satan loves that we build the wall.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.620]   He loves that we cut people off.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:15.520]   His whole goal is to divide you, to separate you, to see the church divided.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.800]   And it doesn't happen and these walls don't get built overnight, it's just one by one
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.440]   by one, we begin to put them up and put them in place.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.240]   But there is a solution.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.320]   The Bible says to deal with the hurt that turns into this resentment that just builds
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   this wall.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:42.440]   Ephesians chapter four says this, verse 26, "In your anger, do not sin.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:49.280]   Do not let the sun go down while you are angry and do not give the devil a foothold.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:57.160]   Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, brawling, slander, and every form of malice or evil
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.000]   intent.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.720]   Be kind and compassionate to one another."
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.600]   So Paul just said, hey, get rid of all anger, all bitterness, all brawling, brawling is
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.920]   your thing, get rid of all of that and replace it with being kind and compassionate.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.040]   That sounds so easy, Paul.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   Really?
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   Just be nice, that's your solution?
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   No, he says how you can do that.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.720]   Forgiving one another.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.080]   Just as Christ, in Christ, God has forgiven you.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.840]   The remedy for all of the anger, all of the things you hold onto, all the bitterness that
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.120]   marks your life, all the resentment that's beneath the surface, there is one remedy that
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.240]   the Bible says and that is through forgiveness.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.600]   Making the decision, hey, I'm gonna choose to forgive this person.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   What is forgiveness?
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.680]   So the third idea is the solution for the sinful anger in your life, for the broken
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.400]   relationships in your life, for the times that somebody did you wrong in your life,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.560]   is forgiveness.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.280]   Making the decision, I'm gonna choose to forgive just as God in Christ has forgiven me.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.880]   I'm making the decision to forgive.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   So what is forgiveness?
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.680]   Well, let's talk about what it isn't.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.960]   Forgiveness is not excusing someone's sin.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.880]   Hey, you cheated on me and that was okay.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.120]   Hey, you lied to me and that was okay.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   We're just gonna excuse that.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.920]   That's not what God does at all.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.160]   He doesn't excuse someone's sin and say it's not that serious.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.680]   It was so serious it put Jesus on the cross.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.760]   So it's not excusing it and saying, hey, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   It's not forgetting.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   Sometimes people will say, hey, forgive and forget.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760]   You don't forgive and forget.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.400]   In order to forgive, you cannot forget because it's choosing.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.240]   I know the offense that was created and I'm choosing to forgive.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   And I'm gonna tell you what forgiveness is here in a second.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.800]   The two other things that it's not, it's not denying hurt or angry.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.720]   If you've been hurt or sinned against, you shouldn't deny it.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.640]   God gets angry over sin.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:53.040]   Forgiveness is not conditional and it doesn't require the person asking for it or to own
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.480]   their part or even be present.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.900]   Forgiveness is releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.000]   Forgiveness is deciding I am releasing the demand for justice over how I was wrong, how
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.280]   I was hurt, what was done to me.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   I'm gonna trust God with that.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.840]   I am choosing to forgive every sin that's ever been, ever taken place will either be
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.460]   paid for, has been paid for on the cross by Jesus or by the person for all of eternity.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:21.120]   So if they're a believer and they've trusted in Christ, I am choosing to release any need
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.040]   for justice or vengeance to God.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.900]   Ultimately, that's in his hands and he'll account for it.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.280]   And I'm choosing to let go of the debt.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.480]   What does forgiveness look like practically?
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   So that's what it is.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   How do you do forgiveness practically?
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   The first thing is this, the scripture says to overlook an offense if you can.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.720]   It says in Proverbs chapter 19 verse 11, a person's wisdom yields patience.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.920]   It is to one's glory to overlook an offense.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:54.380]   So the Proverbs say, hey, it is a glorious thing if somebody does something that offends
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.920]   you and you're able to be like, hey, I believe the best, it's okay, I'm sure they didn't
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.920]   mean it.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.520]   If you can overlook it, it's a glorious thing, the scripture says.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.240]   How do I know if I can overlook it?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.360]   Can you overlook it?
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.840]   If you find yourself replaying the tape or rehearsing the conversation and thinking about
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   that moment again, and I can't believe that they did that, and really reinvesting or rethinking
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.200]   through the scenario again, there's probably a good likelihood you cannot overlook it.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:28.440]   If you replay the tape one time, two times, three times, you should move towards reconciling
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   with that person.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.520]   The first thing is, if you can't overlook it, overlook it.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.840]   If you can't, the Bible says that you and I are to move quickly.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.720]   So how do you resolve or how do you extend forgiveness and deal with anger, deal with
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.500]   the bitter bricks that are in your life?
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.040]   The first thing is, whenever one of those bricks popped up and I'm tempted to put it
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.720]   on there, I'm gonna move quickly to deal with it and extend forgiveness to that person.
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.880]   It says, don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.660]   In Ephesians four, we just read the verse.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.560]   Does that mean literally, don't let the sun go down before your anger?
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.560]   I don't know.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   I don't think so.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.680]   He's just saying, hey, move quickly.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.280]   Here's why I think, probably not, because if you lived in Alaska during the summer,
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.880]   you would have the entire summer to not deal with any anger.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.880]   You'd be like, sun never goes down.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.560]   It can't be literal if it's saying, hey, it has to, if the sun goes down, the people in
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.080]   Alaska are like, yep, I got 'til September and then I'll deal with this.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.440]   He's just saying, hey, move quickly.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.880]   Keep short accounts.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.640]   If there's something that happened, if you got hurt by something, move quickly.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.400]   Don't try to put it away or dismiss it if you can't.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.800]   And most of us, honestly, we are peace fakers.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   We're not peacemakers.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.080]   And so when somebody hurts us, you need to move in the direction of, hey, this hurt me
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.720]   when you did that.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   So move quickly.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   Keeping short accounts.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.320]   If everyone in this room just did this, it would change the world.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:44.600]   Because how many people sit on something, and I've been thinking about this for six months.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.640]   The second thing is that when you go and you discuss and say, hey, this hurt me, when you
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   bring up the hurt that took place, the anger that you're holding onto, you need to own
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.640]   your part.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.000]   You know what it says in Matthew chapter seven?
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.320]   Jesus says, before you do anything to address the sin in someone else's life, you need to
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.600]   first own your part.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.840]   Own everything that you can about the situation.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.480]   Some of you, maybe the thing that most you need to own is you've been holding onto being
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.280]   hurt or being sinned against for years.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.960]   And you need to go tonight, tomorrow, quickly and say, hey, will you forgive me?
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.040]   You hurt me like six months ago and I've been holding onto that and it's impacted the way
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.080]   that I see you, the way that I think about you, honestly, the way that I talk about you.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.440]   My likelihood to do 10 things if you're around because honestly, it just hurt me.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.000]   And you need to ask for forgiveness for holding onto that if they're a believer.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.660]   Because the Bible says you are to move quickly.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.360]   Do not give the devil a foothold in your life.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:40.080]   And by waiting and prolonging, you are giving him a foothold.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:47.620]   So go, move quickly, own your part, and then when you go to them, go and focus on two things
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.620]   in particular.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.400]   So when you talk, you're like, hey, this is what happened and this is when you hurt me.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.480]   Focus on two very specific things, very, very specific things.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.800]   When you go to them, you don't focus on their motive and hey, you always do this type of
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   thing.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:30:59.800]   You focus on two things.
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.360]   The very specific action that they did.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.600]   You did not call me back.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.360]   And then the specific emotion it created in you.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.720]   And when you did that, it made me feel like you don't care about me.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.480]   I'm gonna focus not on like, hey, you're just, you're a bad apple.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.040]   This is what, the type of person that you are.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:20.960]   Don't focus on, don't say statements like you always or you are, but focus on when you
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.440]   did X.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.080]   It made me feel X.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.800]   Whenever you did not invite me on that trip with all of our roommates, it made me feel
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.520]   like you don't care about me.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.200]   It made me feel alone.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.480]   Address the very specific behavior that they had.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.600]   Don't attack their motive, don't attack their character.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.200]   Just attack or focus on the very specific behavior that they had and then what it made you feel
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.200]   inside of you.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:55.760]   Finally, the fourth component or fifth component, what it looks like to forgive someone is to
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:58.880]   extend grace over and over and over.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.320]   In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus says, or he's asked the question by Peter, how many times
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   should I forgive someone?
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.880]   Up to seven times if they've sinned against me.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.920]   And Jesus says 70 times seven, some of your translations, 'cause there's a footnote on
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.400]   it, that the Greek is unclear whether he's saying 77 times or 70 times seven times seven.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.600]   As in like on and on and on, that there is no end, there's no limit that God puts on
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.680]   it because you're to forgive like God in Christ forgives you.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.800]   And he doesn't have some limit of, all right, you just reached 77, I guess that's it, we're
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.120]   done.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.720]   That over and over, that as believers, you are called to forgive, you are commanded.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.520]   And God says if you do not forgive, God will not forgive you.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520]   Think about that.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.200]   That as painful as the hurt is, as long as you've carried it, as deep as the scars run,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.000]   that there's a God who's there who says, I want you to work towards healing.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.720]   And as long as you carry anger around, you're gonna build up walls in every direction.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.560]   And eventually you're gonna wall yourself off and the wall comes over here, the wall
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.280]   comes over here, the wall comes around, and you make a prison for yourself.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.520]   And the way that you tear down the wall is one brick at a time.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.960]   Hey, you forgot to invite me, I'm forgiving you.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.160]   You didn't show up and you weren't a part of my sports games, and I'm forgiving you.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.920]   I'm not gonna hold onto that anymore.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.200]   And I'm choosing to make the decision, I'm not gonna carry this.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   How long are you gonna carry it?
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.160]   Like for real, how long are you gonna be angry at what happened when you grew up?
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.560]   How long are you gonna hold it against your friend from high school?
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.720]   How long are you gonna hold it against your sibling?
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.920]   How long are you not gonna call your parents back?
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.920]   I want you to answer that.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.700]   Like some of you, you need to tonight, you've got some business, the God who's there says
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.880]   you need to leave here right now.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.760]   Leave your gift at the altar.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.600]   And you need to go be reconciled with the people in your life.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.200]   You're carrying around the hurts.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.140]   And the only way you're gonna break down those barriers, and the God who's there hates that
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:44.140]   there's barriers.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.520]   The scripture says that he came in Ephesians chapter two to tear down the dividing wall
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.200]   of hostility between people.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.960]   Satan loves the barriers.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.000]   He wants you to think right now, you're the victim, you were harmed, you can't do anything
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.640]   about it, you should be angry.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.320]   He wants you to hold onto that.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.720]   And when you do, it makes every relationship you have, it's a lot easier, I'm just gonna
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.320]   put these bricks back on, that's just who I'm gonna be.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.680]   So they own it, and they deserve it, I'm done with those people.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.800]   And there's a freedom that God offers, and the freedom comes through choosing, I'm going
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.340]   to forgive, even though they didn't earn it, even though they don't deserve it, I'm choosing
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.900]   that, I'm not gonna let this define my life.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.020]   If you're in a dating relationship, this is so huge, we're about to land a plane.
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.600]   Before you get married, you've got to deal with this stuff.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   Because if you are holding onto bitterness right now, you're gonna get into marriage,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:37.580]   and you are gonna over and over and over again be deeply hurt by someone who you deeply love.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.380]   And you have got to be able to forgive someone.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.300]   Billy Graham said that what makes a great marriage is two great forgivers, it is so
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.180]   true, because it is one wound after the next, and choosing to forgive.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.580]   I want this so badly for you, this is a huge part of my story.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.480]   Anger, I entered Region about a year ago, because anger is something that has marked
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.980]   my life, that I struggle with anger.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:01.100]   And that can not, oh it doesn't always look like outbursts and freaking out, but it looks
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.140]   like there's just an anger inside of me.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.460]   And at some point I just said to my community, I think I need to go to Region, I think I
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.460]   need to address this, and it was by beginning to go, what is at the source and at the heart
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.760]   of why I'm angry?
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:15.340]   How is this anger impacting my life?
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.420]   And what is the solution to take in the steps?
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.900]   And the solution is the same for me as it is for you.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.900]   You've got to forgive.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.780]   Some of you have parents like me, that I had to forgive.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.720]   Some of you have siblings, you have relationships, you have an old dating relationship.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.940]   How long are you gonna carry that stuff?
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.400]   And the way that you can be free and tear down the wall is by choosing, I'm not gonna
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.580]   like that to find me anymore.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.860]   I'm choosing to forgive.
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.920]   And that's the only way.
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.700]   And we can't see the walls in your life, but if we could, some of you guys are walled off
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.700]   in every direction.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:55.780]   Ultimately, the call on your life is to choose to forgive like God forgave you.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.580]   How did God forgive you?
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.340]   If you're a Christian, every single time that you've ever sinned, there was a brick as it
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.540]   were put between you and God himself.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:08.140]   That every sin that you had created a division, created something that was unbridgeable for
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.140]   you.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.100]   That every time that you've ever, every look at pornography, every time you've ever gotten
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.260]   wasted, every hit that you've ever taken, every time that you've lied to somebody, everything
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:18.260]   that you've ever misrepresented or slandered somebody or talked bad about somebody, every
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:23.120]   time that you've ever missed the mark of perfection or failed to do all that God calls you to,
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.840]   it was like a brick got put in the way of a relationship with God.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.500]   And Jesus came in and the scripture tells us that he decided, I'm gonna choose to pour
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.380]   over the dividing wall and everything is gonna break down.
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.740]   And Jesus stepped in and gave us the perfect example of there is a path.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:43.660]   And he took all of that forgiveness and he didn't just push it over, he took it on himself
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.860]   to give the perfect example.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.500]   Whatever harms have been done against you, they pale in comparison to what you have done
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.940]   against God, what I have done against God.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:00.980]   And the scripture says, holding onto this bitterness is going to hurt you.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.420]   One person said that forgiveness and choosing to forgive is like unlocking a cage and unlocking
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.900]   a prisoner and discovering the prisoner was you.
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.660]   How long are you gonna be a prisoner?
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.900]   And the God who's there is calling you.
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.700]   If you want to experience freedom, it is possible.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.460]   But there is only one way.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:24.500]   By choosing, I'm releasing the demand for justice to God.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.420]   He paid for it or that person's gonna pay for it for all of eternity and that's a far
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:33.940]   worse thing to experience than anything they could have ever done for me, eternity in hell.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:39.260]   And I'm choosing to forgive or you can carry it and you can build the walls in your life.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.700]   And the more you build, the more you're gonna build and the more people you're gonna shut
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.900]   off, including God himself.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.580]   And the reason he's gonna feel distant at times is because he's saying there's distance
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.580]   in your relationships.
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.060]   And you're gonna feel distant with me as long as you're there.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.900]   Let me pray.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:38:00.980]   Father, thank you that the dividing wall of hostility you tore down with the cross, that
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:09.580]   you took every sin we've ever committed, every decision that we've ever made to worship ourselves,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:16.580]   to pursue idols, to pursue worldly fleeting things, the approval of other people around
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:23.940]   us, and a million other ways that we have sinned against a perfect holy God, that you
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.940]   took all of those things and you forgive us, you paid for them all.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.780]   I pray for tonight, specifically for men and women, for friends in the room who have never
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:38.060]   forgiven and even as I talk, they know I need to work, I need to forgive that person.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.740]   I'm holding them at a distance and I've never really worked through this.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.540]   And on the surface, nobody can really tell and I try to be nice, but I'm holding it against
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:52.140]   them, that right now, where you are or wherever they are, that you would meet them there and
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.700]   they would make the decision, I'm not gonna hold onto this anger anymore.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.700]   I'm releasing it to you.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:04.540]   I'm entrusting it to you, the God who paid for everything I've ever done, everything
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.980]   that's ever been done against me, and I want freedom.
[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:09.100]   That they would have that.
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:14.140]   I pray that you would break up every couple in this room who wants to move forward without
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:19.780]   dealing with the anger, the bitterness, the resentment from the past, maybe even from
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:24.460]   the present, that they wouldn't take those things in and bring a marriage of people that
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.940]   are just constantly filled with bitterness and resentment towards one another.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:35.460]   Would you fill our hearts with love and compassion towards one another and rid of all anger and
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:41.300]   malice and all of the things that don't honor you and do so by allowing us to forgive one
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.860]   another as you and Christ have forgiven us.
[00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.600]   We worship you now in song, amen.
