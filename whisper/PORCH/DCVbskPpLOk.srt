 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,960
 [CHEERING]

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:30,440
, [CHEERING]

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,920
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,240
 [APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,520
 So I got a new car.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,400
 Got a new car, which warrants a story.

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,080
 Got to tell you the story.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,560
 And so if we don't know each other, if you're new here,

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,200
 that's not normal, by the way.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,600
 If you're listening on the podcast,

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 the audios are just pulled out in a car.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,760
 And so I have-- like my hobby, what

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,640
 I've done for the longest time is I buy and sell things.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,680
 I've always done this.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,840
 And so that's just kind of like some guys crochet,

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,760
 some guys watch football.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,600
 Do guys crochet?

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,120
 No guys crochet.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,200
 So I buy and sell things.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,160
 That's my hobby.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
 And so I had this golf cart.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,480
 True story.

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,600
 Had a golf cart.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,320
 Had it on Craigslist.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
 And this guy reaches out and said, hey,

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,960
 I'll trade you for a Toyota Corolla.

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
 And I'm like, golf cart for a Toyota Corolla?

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,000
 Sure, I'll take that trade.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,600
 And so then I have the Toyota Corolla, and I sell it.

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,400
 And so then I take that cash, and I'm looking for, OK,

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,520
 where am I going to put that cash?

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,640
 Because this is kind of my side hustle, right?

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,360
 This is my pastor side hustle.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,720
 And so I'm looking for where I'm going to put that cash.

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,800
 I'm looking at different things, and I see that.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,080
 And I'm like, dude, got to have that, right?

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,760
 Got to have it.

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
 And I'm talking to the guy.

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,600
 I'm like, I can't afford that, though, right?

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,480
 And he gives me the craziest deal, like craziest deal

42
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
 that you could ever imagine.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,360
 So here's what I'm feeling.

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,760
 I'm like, OK, my heart has already moved that direction.

45
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,600
 Like, I got to have it, right?

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,800
 And now, because of the deal, I'm thinking, hey,

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,320
 I've got limited time.

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 Like, I got to lock this up, right?

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,200
 And the reason I start there is because as we're

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,240
 moving through this fantasy series,

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,280
 we're talking about finding real love in a fake world.

52
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,960
 Last week, we talked about the fantasy girl

53
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,440
 out of Proverbs 31.

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,840
 Tonight, we're talking about the fantasy guy.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,720
 I'm talking to the ladies.

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
 And what I think--

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,200
 are the ladies here?

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,880
 Did they show up?

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,120
 [CHEERING]

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
 Do you all want to do that again?

61
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
 Because last week-- I'm going to be honest.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,480
 I think the guys beat you last week.

63
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,520
 Did the ladies show up?

64
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,280
 [CHEERING]

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
 They showed up.

66
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,640
 They showed up.

67
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,400
 Ladies, here's something that I think you do, right?

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,280
 I think you know what you're looking for.

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
 I said about the guys last week, I said,

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,840
 you guys don't know what you're looking for.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,920
 Ladies, I think you know what you're looking for.

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,040
 I think you do, OK, to your credit.

73
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,600
 I think you know what you're looking for.

74
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,400
 But when you see something that you really like,

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
 it's all out the window, OK?

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
 Like, your heart is gone.

77
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,880
 And you stop looking.

78
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,120
 You stop thinking, right?

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
 You stop thinking with your brain.

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,620
 You start thinking with your heart.

81
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,120
 And you-- ladies are weird.

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,800
 Like, there's this thing about y'all.

83
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,440
 You're not weird.

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,100
 I love you guys.

85
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,280
 But here's the deal.

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,240
 This is weird about you.

87
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,840
 You're kind of competitive.

88
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,400
 I almost think you're more competitive than guys.

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,440
 Yeah.

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,360
 And so it's like you think, I got to lock him up

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,280
 before anybody can get to him, you know?

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,920
 Like, nobody's going to get this deal, you know what I'm saying?

93
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,360
 And so it's just-- you start thinking like that.

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,640
 Like, hey, I'm going to--

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,360
 OK.

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,820
 And you begin to think, because if I don't go here,

97
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,140
 what if nothing else comes along?

98
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,940
 And you begin to play these mental games.

99
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,820
 So I go to pick up the slingshot.

100
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,700
 It's what's called a slingshot.

101
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,380
 Appropriately called the slingshot.

102
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,700
 And so I go to pick up this thing, OK?

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,940
 And the day-- like, day one, check engine light comes on.

104
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,120
 And then-- yeah, yeah, Craigslist.

105
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,860
 And then I'm driving, and it says, brake failure.

106
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,320
 Yeah, I'm surprised it's still here.

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,220
 Brake failure.

108
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,260
 I was like praying for you guys in the front row.

109
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,940
 I was just--

110
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,020
 [LAUGHTER]

111
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,460
 Lord, please, make it stop.

112
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,340
 So then I go, and I'm calling places to--

113
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,620
 OK, here's the truth.

114
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,780
 This is not an overstatement.

115
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,260
 There's not a single place in Dallas, Texas

116
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,420
 that works on that.

117
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,860
 Not a single place.

118
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,740
 Not one, OK?

119
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,900
 I eventually, after calling seven different dealerships,

120
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,660
 I find they refer me to a place in Irving

121
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,620
 that will work on it.

122
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,940
 And so then he says--

123
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,740
 he goes, here's the deal.

124
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,380
 He goes, here's the deal.

125
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,260
 I'm like, hey, the check engine light came on.

126
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,040
 This brake failure.

127
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,360
 Can you give me an idea of what it's going to be to repair?

128
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,220
 And he goes, well, it could be $10,000.

129
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,760
 And I'm like, $10,000?

130
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
 That's more than I pay.

131
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,520
 I can't-- what are you--

132
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,400
 are you serious?

133
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,320
 It could be $10,000?

134
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
 And then he says this.

135
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,720
 He goes, you should have brought it in.

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
 We could have done one of our six-point checks, checkups.

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,100
 We could have done one of our inspections.

138
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
 We'd go through these six points.

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,560
 We could have told you.

140
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,300
 I was like, oh, man, I'm so sorry.

141
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,920
 That's exactly what I should have--

142
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,320
 why didn't I know that there's this place in Irving that

143
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,000
 works on slingshots so I could bring it

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,320
 in for a six-point checkup?

145
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,240
 You know, what was I thinking, buddy?

146
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 That's what I should have done, OK?

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,320
 And so I say that to you because, ladies, when

148
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,320
 your heart goes out the window, it's gone.

149
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,800
 I think that you could back up by not just being so moved

150
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,400
 by the way someone looks--

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
 the way someone looks or some other things

152
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,660
 that you're attracted to-- and you

153
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,540
 can begin to think, continue to think with your mind,

154
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,180
 and go through a six-point checklist.

155
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,460
 In fact, I'm going to give it to you tonight.

156
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,140
 A six-point checklist, six things

157
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,540
 that you can inspect to see if he is God's man.

158
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,700
 We said last week--

159
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,860
 I said my friend Daniel said this--

160
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,320
 that dating is assessing the suitability

161
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,780
 of a possible spouse.

162
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,660
 That's what dating is.

163
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,580
 You're trying to figure out, hey,

164
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,660
 are they someone that I can be married to?

165
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,740
 Are they someone that I can spend the rest of my life with?

166
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,980
 And this is a very practical, very logical thing.

167
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,740
 You can just run through and think through these ideas.

168
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,800
 And so I'm going to be in 1 Timothy chapter 3

169
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,900
 to talk about what you are looking for.

170
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,400
 But before I do, I want you to know

171
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,420
 we did a little bit of research for this message.

172
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,660
 We went to the State Fair of Texas,

173
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,700
 and we asked ladies what they were looking for.

174
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,940
 And so this is what they said.

175
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,440
 Watch this.

176
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,340
 Hey, guys.

177
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,980
 Josh and Elaine out here at the State Fair.

178
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,600
 And we're here trying to figure out how people navigate life,

179
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,260
 love, relationships.

180
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,500
 Dating, their dream guy, their dream girl.

181
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,460
 Let's figure it out.

182
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,460
 Describe to me your dream guy.

183
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,500
 Probably like a nerd.

184
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,940
 I love nerds.

185
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,300
 They have to be into anime and comic books.

186
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,660
 Sexy.

187
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,780
 He's rich.

188
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,500
 Honest.

189
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
 And he's sweet.

190
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
 Like a dog.

191
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,980
 You know how if a dog sees somebody that they don't know,

192
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,140
 they're really mean?

193
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,380
 But they're really loyal to their-- yeah,

194
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,140
 I want him to be like my dog.

195
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,820
 Interesting and driven.

196
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,620
 But I don't know.

197
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,300
 It's also funny and has the same long-term goals.

198
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,420
 There's not a dream guy.

199
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,940
 It's just-- like, looks-wise, or just like,

200
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,180
 you have to have a good heart.

201
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,980
 That's number one.

202
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,260
 My dream look guy is not actually

203
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,420
 the guy I'm going to marry.

204
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,460
 Not that I don't think my fiance's attractive.

205
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,020
 I do.

206
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
 What do you mean by rich?

207
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,260
 Let's say like $5 million and up.

208
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,420
 He doesn't have to have $5 million.

209
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,820
 But I mean, you know, enough to be comfortable.

210
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,540
 You know, like--

211
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,220
 A job and income, I guess.

212
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,860
 The bar is literally on the floor.

213
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,260
 Yeah, it is.

214
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,380
 [END PLAYBACK]

215
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,780
 We got some work to do.

216
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,700
 That's called job security right there.

217
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,460
 Young Adult Ministry, job security, right?

218
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,220
 OK, ladies, here's the deal.

219
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,980
 Here's what I want you to know.

220
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,860
 Us guys, we are really good about getting

221
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,140
 your heart involved so that you're not

222
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,820
 thinking with your mind.

223
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,700
 We're pros at it.

224
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,160
 OK, I'm letting you in on a secret.

225
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,580
 Guys, I'm sorry to let this out.

226
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,900
 Right up top, I know some of you are like,

227
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,940
 why are you telling them?

228
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,060
 Why are you telling them?

229
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,460
 You got to know, ladies, OK?

230
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,180
 I have to.

231
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,940
 As a pastor, I got to let you know that we are pros.

232
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,460
 We've been training since the fifth grade

233
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,780
 about how to get your heart involved so that you're not

234
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,900
 thinking with your mind.

235
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,420
 You're not asking questions like, well, is he committed?

236
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,380
 Does he have integrity?

237
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,460
 Has he surrendered to the word of God?

238
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,020
 Does he focus on these things?

239
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,220
 We don't want you asking those, OK?

240
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,700
 We just want to say whatever we need to say.

241
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,980
 We might sing to you, write poetry.

242
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,940
 We'll do crazy, stupid things just so that you're not

243
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,820
 thinking with your mind, so that you're

244
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,580
 thinking with your heart, so that you like us.

245
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,100
 Because we want to be liked, just like you guys want

246
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,980
 to be liked.

247
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,300
 The guys that are pursuing you and want your attention,

248
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,660
 they also want to be liked.

249
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,500
 And so I really-- my heart tonight

250
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,340
 is I really want to help you.

251
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,220
 Because it's hard for me to have the same conversation over

252
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,900
 and over and over, where you're here

253
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,180
 and you're meeting with one of my female counterparts

254
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,100
 up here at Watermark.

255
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
 And you're crying.

256
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,620
 Your mascara's all run down your face.

257
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,940
 And you're saying, but everybody thought he was a good guy.

258
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,980
 And I see it all the time.

259
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,700
 Like, just in case I risk some of you thinking

260
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,660
 I'm talking about you.

261
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,140
 I'm not.

262
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,500
 I'm talking about hundreds of you.

263
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,580
 But everyone thought he was a good-- everybody

264
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,140
 thought he was a good guy.

265
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,740
 And I hate that.

266
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,980
 I really do.

267
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,580
 And so my heart is to help you find out early on,

268
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:38,780
 before your heart gets engaged, if he is God's man.

269
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,260
 Because your method, it's not working.

270
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,620
 I'm going to give you some stats.

271
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,380
 These stats are not your fault. You

272
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,140
 need to know that up front.

273
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,860
 But I think I can help you avoid them.

274
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,180
 Nearly half, 43% of all college women

275
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,300
 report having experienced either abuse or controlling behaviors

276
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,900
 in a dating relationship.

277
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,460
 Nearly half.

278
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,300
 45.4% of female rape victims were

279
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,540
 raped by an intimate partner.

280
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,040
 What?

281
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,020
 That's a high number.

282
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,860
 Intimate partner violence accounts

283
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,820
 for 15% of all violent crimes.

284
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,140
 One in four women have been victims

285
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,860
 of severe physical violence by an intimate partner

286
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,380
 in their lifetime.

287
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,380
 I mean, that is some serious stats.

288
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,140
 And just that you would potentially

289
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,620
 be in a relationship with a guy who might hurt you,

290
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,300
 that's something we have to address.

291
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,180
 Again, it's not your fault. Not your fault at all.

292
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,580
 But I think, as we dive into the word of God,

293
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,980
 I think he can help us.

294
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,540
 And he can help you where the next guy that you

295
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,580
 would go on a second date with would be your forever guy,

296
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,540
 the one that you're going to spend forever with.

297
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,700
 I think we can get there tonight.

298
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,660
 So I'm going to give you a six-point checklist,

299
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,980
 six things to inspect.

300
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,820
 This chapter, 1 Timothy 3, this is the chapter of what God says.

301
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,220
 This is what I want the leader of my bride to look like.

302
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,100
 So this is a chapter on elders.

303
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,740
 When you hear the word elder, it doesn't mean like old person.

304
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,700
 It means church leader, pastor, and shepherd.

305
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,980
 It's the same word in the Greek that's used.

306
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,860
 When you hear the word elder, don't think like elderly.

307
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,380
 Think wise leader of the church.

308
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,940
 And so this is a great list for you to look at.

309
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,780
 We're going to boil it down to six things.

310
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,020
 It's a lot of things, though.

311
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,580
 It's very circular.

312
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,420
 He repeats himself, different ideas, different words

313
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,660
 that mean the same thing.

314
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,020
 So we're going to boil it down to six things to look at.

315
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,180
 But I'm just going to read this to you up front.

316
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,900
 This is what God says, hey, if someone's

317
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,220
 going to lead my bride, which is the church,

318
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,740
 if you're new to the church, God calls his bride,

319
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,820
 Jesus's bride, the church.

320
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,300
 If someone's going to lead my bride,

321
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,540
 this is the character traits that they need to have.

322
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,340
 So listen carefully.

323
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,620
 Here's a trustworthy saying.

324
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,620
 Whoever aspires to be an overseer

325
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,780
 desires a noble task.

326
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,740
 Men, if you're here and you're male,

327
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,980
 if you're listening and you're male,

328
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,500
 you should desire to be an elder.

329
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,420
 That's a noble task.

330
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,800
 You want to meet these qualifications.

331
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,300
 Now the overseer or the elder or the pastor

332
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,500
 or the shepherd is to be above reproach,

333
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,820
 faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled,

334
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,540
 respectable, hospitable, able to teach,

335
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,260
 not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle,

336
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,820
 not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.

337
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,180
 He must manage his own family well

338
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,820
 and see that his children obey him.

339
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,140
 And he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.

340
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,380
 If anyone does not know how to manage his own family,

341
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,720
 how can he take care of God's church, Jesus's bride?

342
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,600
 If he can't take care of his own bride,

343
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,020
 how can he take care of Jesus's bride?

344
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,580
 He must not be a recent convert

345
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,740
 or he maybe becomes conceited

346
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,940
 and fall under the same judgment as the devil.

347
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,060
 He must also have a good reputation with outsiders

348
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,660
 so that he will not fall into disgrace

349
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,660
 and into the devil's trap.

350
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,620
 So let's take that long list of things

351
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,180
 and let's boil it down to six things

352
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,940
 that you can inspect in a potential husband.

353
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,420
 The first one, you can inspect his commitments.

354
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,940
 Number one, inspect his commitments.

355
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,420
 What's he committed to?

356
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,020
 What does he give his life to?

357
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,660
 It's okay, like if he loves his alma mater

358
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,100
 or he loves the Cowboys, that's fine.

359
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,660
 That's great that he's a Cowboys fan.

360
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,740
 If he loves the Cowboys more than he loves anything,

361
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,620
 that's going to be problematic, right?

362
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,420
 And so also, what are the commitments

363
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,020
 that he's made and kept?

364
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,060
 Is he committed to his church?

365
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,900
 After all, we're talking about church leadership here.

366
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,940
 Is he under the authority of the elders?

367
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,060
 Like this is not mind-blowing stuff.

368
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,580
 It's very simple things to inspect.

369
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,100
 The bar is not that high.

370
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,100
 Hey, I want a guy, number one,

371
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,500
 who is under the authority of elders.

372
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 He's a member of a local body.

373
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,540
 That is basic 101.

374
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,020
 That's gonna save you a lot of hurt and heartache.

375
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,140
 Is he committed to a community group, a small group?

376
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,020
 Can I tell you something?

377
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,120
 My guys that I meet with every Friday,

378
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,700
 they are the biggest blessing to my wife,

379
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,900
 she would tell you.

380
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,660
 Like they are a layer of protection

381
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,980
 between her and my flesh.

382
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,400
 They are a safety net.

383
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,740
 They are a number that she can call and say,

384
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,580
 hey, will you pray for JP in this way?

385
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,460
 Will you check in here?

386
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,740
 Hey, here's an area where we disagree.

387
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
 One of the most loving things that she can do for me

388
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,620
 is tell on me to those guys.

389
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,260
 She has absolute freedom.

390
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,340
 I've told her over and over,

391
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,160
 hey, you reach out to those guys any time.

392
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,820
 If you see me out of bounds or doing something foolish,

393
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,860
 please bring them in.

394
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,800
 And so is he committed to community?

395
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,480
 Every week, every Tuesday night, we try to help you.

396
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,060
 Hey, there's a room over here, there's a room over here.

397
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,460
 Guys go here, girls go here.

398
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,060
 If you're looking for community,

399
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,820
 how many times have you heard that and not responded?

400
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,860
 Is he committed to the covenant of marriage?

401
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,980
 It says in verse two,

402
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,300
 now the overseer is to be above reproach,

403
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,500
 faithful to his wife.

404
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,860
 Is he committed to the covenant of marriage?

405
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,060
 Like does he believe that marriage is a covenant,

406
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,880
 that sex is reserved for marriage,

407
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,460
 that it's a very important,

408
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,560
 it's more than a commitment to God,

409
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,020
 it's a covenant before God?

410
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,260
 I get to do weddings.

411
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,500
 Monica and I get to do premarital counseling.

412
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,640
 And when you are at your wedding,

413
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,640
 you're gonna say some crazy things to each other.

414
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,020
 Okay, people say, for richer or poorer,

415
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,080
 in sickness and in health,

416
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,500
 and to death do us part.

417
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,620
 And so I ask this question,

418
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,940
 and it's always a little bit awkward.

419
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,340
 I just say, hey, let me ask you a question.

420
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,480
 Is there anything that you would leave her for?

421
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,380
 No, nothing, I love her, nothing.

422
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,860
 Nothing could cause me to question my love for her.

423
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,720
 Anything, no.

424
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,120
 Okay, if she cheats on you repeatedly with your best friend,

425
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,660
 you still in on this commitment,

426
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,320
 this till death do us part?

427
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,300
 Well, she would never do that.

428
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,680
 I know, I know.

429
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,060
 She's a good person.

430
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,020
 Well, here's what I believe about people.

431
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
 Their heart is wicked and deceitful.

432
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,280
 They're sinners.

433
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,820
 We're capable of all sorts of evil.

434
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,360
 And so as I'm gonna stand before God

435
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,320
 and join in this promise with you guys,

436
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,980
 I'm asking, what are you gonna leave her for?

437
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,580
 Okay, 'cause I need to know that.

438
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,820
 I don't want you to say until death do us part,

439
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,660
 unless you mean it.

440
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,980
 Like if you're thinking, no, no, no,

441
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,940
 if she cheats on me repeatedly with my best friend,

442
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,860
 it won't stop, like I get an out.

443
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,140
 Well, cool, that's great that you think that.

444
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,100
 Let's just write that in the vows.

445
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,220
 For richer or poorer, in sickness and health,

446
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,340
 until death do us part,

447
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,940
 unless she cheats on me repeatedly with my best friend.

448
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,540
 Okay, I'm just gonna write that in there

449
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,100
 so we keep it honest, okay?

450
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,120
 We gotta keep it honest, right?

451
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,800
 Let's say what we mean and mean what we say,

452
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,400
 because it's a really serious commitment.

453
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
 That's why I say that.

454
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,980
 It's a really serious commitment.

455
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,120
 And so let's not promise it unless we mean it.

456
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,200
 People email me all the time,

457
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,020
 and girls will write in and they'll say,

458
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,560
 you know, my boyfriend cheated on me, what do I do?

459
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,080
 Let me answer that, okay?

460
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
 Let me answer that.

461
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,920
 You're not gonna like my answer.

462
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,520
 No one ever does, no one's ever responded like,

463
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
 oh, I love that answer, it's so helpful.

464
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,280
 You break up, that's what you do.

465
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,960
 And you say, well, where's the grace in that?

466
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,500
 You show grace when they're married, okay?

467
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,880
 You're not married, that's the good news.

468
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
 Remember what dating is?

469
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,220
 You're assessing if they're a suitable spouse.

470
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,200
 And if they're cheating on you, they're saying something.

471
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,220
 They're saying, guess what, I'm not a suitable spouse.

472
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,840
 I'm not marriage material, I like to cheat.

473
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
 And maybe it was one time, I drank too much,

474
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,760
 we were on a break, I don't know, okay?

475
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,040
 But I would take that as a red flag.

476
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,920
 Like, ladies, I don't know, man, I hate this for you.

477
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,120
 I don't know, like you don't understand

478
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,640
 the princess that you are.

479
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,600
 You don't understand, like I don't think you were ever like,

480
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
 oh, he broke up, he cheated on me.

481
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,560
 I just don't know what to do.

482
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,920
 Like, man, I can tell you what to do.

483
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,200
 Like, let him go.

484
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,000
 Don't even date guys that might cheat on you.

485
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,960
 Like, if that's in the realm of the possibility,

486
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,760
 they're not marriage material.

487
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,680
 God is telling you something very lovingly.

488
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,960
 And so often, the reason that you don't want to

489
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,020
 is because you feel guilty, because you know

490
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,040
 he's already been cheating on his wife with you.

491
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,200
 What I mean, his wife is not the one he's met yet,

492
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,440
 but the one that he will marry.

493
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,200
 What I mean is you guys have been physical,

494
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,760
 and so a lot of times, you feel stuck and trapped.

495
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,560
 And I don't know why, ladies, you feel bad.

496
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,000
 Like, well, he needs to experience release,

497
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
 so I understand, and you like extend grace.

498
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,980
 That's always a little odd to me.

499
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,920
 Right, he can make war on your behalf,

500
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,220
 or he can marry you.

501
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,680
 So another thing to check,

502
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,700
 six-point checklist is his humility.

503
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,180
 Check his humility.

504
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,740
 It says he must not be a recent convert,

505
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,940
 or he may become conceited, which is the opposite of humility

506
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,180
 and fall under the same judgment as the devil.

507
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,060
 Here's what that means,

508
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,520
 fall under the same judgment as the devil.

509
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,920
 Lucifer, or Satan, or the devil, all the same,

510
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,400
 okay, he was an angel.

511
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,300
 He was with God.

512
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,900
 It says the most beautiful angel in the scripture.

513
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,280
 And he was made, he's a created being,

514
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,940
 to reflect God's glory.

515
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,160
 But one day, he said, hey, I don't want to worship you

516
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,980
 as God, I want to be like God.

517
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,180
 And God said, hey, you think you can be like me?

518
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,120
 Then you go down there to that planet Earth, all right,

519
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,900
 and you will run this cosmic experiment.

520
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,060
 Let's see how good of a God you are.

521
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,140
 And so it says in the scripture,

522
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,560
 he's the prince of this air, he's the ruler of this world.

523
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,100
 We kind of live in this cosmic supernatural experiment.

524
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,780
 Are we gonna follow the ways of Satan,

525
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,980
 or are we gonna follow the ways of God?

526
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,020
 And God says, Satan was conceited.

527
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,460
 That's why he did that.

528
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,580
 And so you don't want to date a guy who's like Satan,

529
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,820
 or who is conceited.

530
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,820
 Is he a here I am guy, or is he a there you are guy?

531
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,940
 What I mean by that is he about himself,

532
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,060
 thinking about himself, or when he engages

533
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,220
 with your family and your friends,

534
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,860
 is he like, oh, tell me about it, so where are you from?

535
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,220
 Oh, that's so interesting.

536
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,740
 Like, whoever drives that, they're a here I am guy, okay?

537
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,620
 Now, before you judge me, it's for sale, all right?

538
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,220
 So if one of you are a here I am guy, I got you, all right?

539
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,620
 And so, right, you don't want a here I am guy.

540
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,340
 You want a, oh, there you are guy.

541
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,400
 Let me turn my attention to you,

542
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,820
 and not just you because he's dating.

543
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,380
 I mean, he's interviewing for the job.

544
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,660
 But how he treats other people, you can look at that,

545
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,340
 and you can see his humility.

546
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,060
 It says not quarrelsome.

547
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,060
 You know, quarrels come from pride, that's verse three.

548
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,120
 Gentleness comes from humility.

549
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,020
 Ladies, I don't,

550
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,100
 I don't understand, ladies.

551
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,320
 Why are you attracted to arrogant jerks?

552
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,420
 Amen.

553
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,740
 Why, though?

554
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,560
 I don't understand.

555
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,460
 Like, man, I just remember, like, that dude

556
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,260
 I went to high school with, like, just because

557
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,160
 he could throw a football, you know, 100 yards,

558
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,340
 and he'd walk through the hallway with his chest out,

559
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,420
 and he drove that obnoxious red car.

560
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,500
 He always dated the head cheerleader.

561
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,780
 So cocky.

562
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,700
 But he always had a girlfriend, the sweet girlfriend,

563
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,660
 the nice girl that he was always messing around.

564
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,700
 I don't understand.

565
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,980
 I know, ladies, that you like confidence.

566
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,720
 Please don't mistake conceit for confidence.

567
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,420
 Being conceited is like counterfeit confidence.

568
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,820
 Confidence is like rooted in the Holy Spirit,

569
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,180
 trusting in God, believing that God's in control.

570
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,320
 Conceited is rooted in your own abilities.

571
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,080
 Thinking that you're all that, that dude will hurt you.

572
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,500
 And so I think humility is one of the most important

573
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,760
 qualities to look for in a man.

574
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,200
 Is he teachable?

575
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,360
 Does he have someone else pouring into him?

576
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,080
 The third thing to inspect is his reputation.

577
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,920
 That's a big one.

578
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,400
 Inspect his reputation.

579
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,600
 It says in verse seven, he must also have a good reputation.

580
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,000
 And so what do other people think about him?

581
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,860
 I think this is the one that you're quick to blow off

582
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,440
 when your heart has already moved that direction.

583
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
 I've seen this before.

584
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,600
 Like your family and your friends are saying,

585
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,520
 "Hey, he's not a good guy, he's not a good guy."

586
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,720
 But here's what you say, ladies, 'cause I've heard it.

587
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,920
 But I really know him.

588
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,400
 Y'all don't know him like I know him.

589
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,800
 All of you people who've been in his life,

590
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,560
 his entire life, and some of you,

591
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,760
 even his sister who was raised with him in the same,

592
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,480
 y'all don't know him like I know him.

593
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,640
 He's like a dog.

594
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,140
 He's mean to other people, but he's nice to me.

595
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,180
 (congregation laughing)

596
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 What does that mean, what does that mean?

597
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:28,580
 He has a good reputation with outsiders.

598
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,660
 Is he respected?

599
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,220
 Your children are gonna have to respect him.

600
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,500
 Because he's not just interviewing

601
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,940
 for the position of husband,

602
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,060
 he's also interviewing for the position of a dad,

603
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,660
 of a father.

604
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,700
 And so it says he must manage his own family well

605
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,860
 and see that his children obey him,

606
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,820
 and he must do so in a manner worthy of full respect.

607
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
 And so will he be a good dad?

608
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,520
 Does he love kids, right?

609
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,700
 Does he enjoy kids?

610
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,540
 That's important.

611
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,000
 Or is he gonna be like, "Hey, we can get married,

612
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,500
 "and for 10 years we'll travel,

613
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,260
 "and then maybe one day we'll have kids."

614
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,100
 I know your expectations align there.

615
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,980
 I told you I buy and sell things.

616
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,540
 One time I bought a stolen car.

617
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,340
 I didn't know it was stolen.

618
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,820
 I mean, the dude had the title and everything.

619
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,160
 I know I should give up on this hobby,

620
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,500
 I know what you're thinking.

621
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,000
 Dude had a title and everything.

622
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,140
 I met him here at a church.

623
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,940
 Like we drove around town, we went to the bank together.

624
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,980
 Like I was sharing the gospel,

625
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,540
 we were talking about Jesus, this guy.

626
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,500
 He showed me a fake ID, he had the title in his hand,

627
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 he sold me the car, I gave him cash, right?

628
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,540
 I'm a fool, I know.

629
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,080
 And then DPS shows up, and they like take the car from me.

630
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,360
 They're like, "Oh, this car is stolen,

631
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,000
 "you can't have it, it's ours now."

632
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
 I'm like, "Oh man, this isn't good."

633
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,280
 And so now, right now what I do is I check Carfax,

634
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,280
 because it shows me the vehicle's history.

635
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,560
 It shows me its reputation, right?

636
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,300
 Ladies, check references.

637
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,920
 Check references.

638
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,400
 Like talk to people who know him.

639
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
 Hopefully you're dating in the church,

640
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,680
 and he's in community, and other people know him.

641
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,040
 I mean, interview his ex-girlfriend

642
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,800
 if you wanna know how he really is.

643
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,840
 Like it's funny that people are like,

644
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,200
 "That's crazy, I would never do that."

645
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,640
 I would do that if I were you, you know?

646
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
 Now here's what happened is guys just lost a little hope,

647
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,720
 and they're like, "Oh man, but I really messed up.

648
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,600
 "You know, I really messed up."

649
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,040
 No, no, here's the deal, there is grace though.

650
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,880
 There is grace.

651
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,920
 Like let me go back to my car analogy.

652
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,680
 For my wife, I bought this car that had a salvage title.

653
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,520
 Here's what that means.

654
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,680
 It had been in a really, really bad accident.

655
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,880
 Like really bad accident.

656
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,960
 Like they thought, the insurance company thought

657
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,840
 it couldn't be repaired.

658
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,920
 But then somebody repaired it.

659
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,460
 And that keeps a lot of people away.

660
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,040
 Like nobody wants the car that's been in a bad accident.

661
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,000
 Except for, here's what I did.

662
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,560
 When I pulled Carfax, I saw that it had been

663
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,420
 three and a half years since that accident,

664
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,200
 and it ran perfect.

665
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,240
 And that told me something.

666
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,480
 That told me that it was fixed.

667
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,800
 That it had been fixed well.

668
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,740
 And so guys, just because he served time,

669
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,700
 doesn't mean he won't be a good husband.

670
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,880
 I mean that.

671
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,120
 Like just because he's made some really tragic mistakes,

672
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,960
 doesn't mean he won't be a good husband.

673
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,880
 But you want to see a track record of faithfulness.

674
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,080
 You want to see a history of faithfulness,

675
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,960
 a season of faithfulness.

676
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,000
 Six months probably isn't long enough.

677
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,480
 Like if you like him in six months,

678
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,960
 and you see six months ago,

679
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,000
 there was a huge wreck in his life.

680
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,480
 Some addiction, something terrible.

681
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,480
 You say, hey, I'm interested in you,

682
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,640
 but I'd love to see a little bit longer

683
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,080
 track record of faithfulness.

684
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,480
 Let's give this some time.

685
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
 Time is our friend.

686
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,560
 It's interesting that that guy that sold me that stolen car,

687
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,740
 he tricked me.

688
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,700
 He was playing a game.

689
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,480
 I mean he showed me a fake ID.

690
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,320
 He said all of the right things.

691
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,240
 I fell victim to his charm.

692
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
 Which the Bible says is deceitful.

693
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,560
 Right?

694
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,920
 Proverbs 31, 30, charm is deceitful.

695
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,560
 And so ladies, if he's interviewing for the job,

696
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,820
 like he may be saying crazy stuff to you.

697
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,320
 Singing songs to you, and writing poems to you,

698
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,480
 and drawing you pictures, sending you text messages.

699
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,720
 But he may be selling you a stolen car.

700
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,060
 So check his references.

701
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,040
 The fourth thing I would inspect

702
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,540
 is his initiative.

703
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,040
 His initiative.

704
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,800
 Does he have some drive?

705
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,240
 Is he passionate about life?

706
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,040
 Does he have some passion in him?

707
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,680
 Like when the going gets hard, is he going to get going?

708
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,500
 Right?

709
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,720
 Get off the couch and make some things happen.

710
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,560
 Right?

711
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,140
 This verse is about leadership.

712
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,400
 That's what this verse is about.

713
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,600
 He must manage his family well.

714
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,320
 To manage his family well, it's going to take some drive.

715
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,480
 And so girls ask me all the time,

716
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,360
 well hey, can a girl ask a guy out?

717
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,240
 Is it okay?

718
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
 Can girls ask guys out?

719
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,160
 I mean, I guess.

720
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,120
 Like I don't think it'll keep you out of heaven or anything.

721
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,020
 What do you mean, can you?

722
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,080
 I don't know.

723
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,360
 Can you?

724
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,480
 I mean, do I think it's God's best?

725
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,060
 No, I don't think it's God's best.

726
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,900
 Right?

727
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,720
 Why?

728
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
 Why don't I think it's God's best?

729
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,240
 Because he's failing the first test.

730
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,040
 Initiative.

731
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,780
 Like what better test to display initiative

732
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,780
 is for him to risk a yes or a no by asking you a question.

733
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,140
 Now we talked a couple weeks ago

734
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,500
 about how scary that is for us guys.

735
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,300
 It's terrifying, ladies, to go up to you

736
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,040
 and to look you in the eyes and to use our words

737
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,300
 and to say, well, will you go out with me?

738
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,060
 You know, I'd like to go on a date with you.

739
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,540
 That's a terrifying thing, 'cause ladies, you are scary.

740
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,700
 Like you got earrings and fingernails and stuff.

741
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,700
 It's terrifying.

742
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,400
 It's really scary.

743
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,980
 I'm serious.

744
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,620
 I'm serious, right?

745
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,920
 But when a guy does that,

746
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,260
 you know, man, this guy, like he likes me enough

747
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,980
 to be vulnerable enough to do something that's hard.

748
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,880
 Hey guys, listen.

749
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 Listen to me.

750
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,740
 Men, you gotta do hard things

751
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,220
 for the rest of your life, okay?

752
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,060
 For the rest of your life,

753
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,200
 you're gonna have to do some really hard things.

754
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,440
 And so it is hard to ask her out.

755
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,720
 I completely empathize with that.

756
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,820
 But do it.

757
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:45,920
 People, you know, men will ask,

758
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,020
 well, what does it mean to lead in dating?

759
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,680
 Having initiative, taking initiative,

760
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,700
 planning, communicating clearly.

761
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,040
 This is what it means to lead in dating,

762
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,120
 leading in purity.

763
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,800
 Guys, I've said this over and over for years now,

764
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,360
 and I wanna help you, men.

765
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,720
 Girls wonder, all right?

766
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,200
 They wonder about everything.

767
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,120
 They wonder if you're gonna text them or call them,

768
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,560
 if there's going to be a date number two,

769
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,960
 and they wonder where you're gonna take them,

770
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,000
 and they wonder if you like them

771
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,960
 and what you think about them,

772
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,280
 and they wonder if you like their perfume

773
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,400
 or if you like their shirt.

774
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,760
 They wonder if you're on a date or if you're just friends

775
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,740
 and it's a friend-ation ship, like where is it going?

776
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,680
 They wonder about these things.

777
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,160
 And then let me tell you something, leaders,

778
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,720
 you can write this down, tweet it out,

779
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,800
 share it with the world, leaders remove confusion.

780
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,040
 If you wanna know what it means to lead in dating,

781
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,680
 you can clap, you can clap for that.

782
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,560
 Ladies, guys, they're clapping

783
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
 because you're not doing this.

784
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,080
 (congregation laughing)

785
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,860
 Leaders remove confusion, all right?

786
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,240
 So anticipate the confusion and remove it with your words.

787
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,720
 Address it, be intentional.

788
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,440
 Say, hey, this is where this is going.

789
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,780
 And ladies, he doesn't need to be rich.

790
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,620
 You need to know that.

791
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,800
 They're like, oh, he, you know, he gotta be rich.

792
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,440
 He doesn't need to be rich.

793
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,800
 He needs to take initiative,

794
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,940
 to be able to look for a job, you know,

795
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,080
 to be gainfully employed, to honor Christ and how he works.

796
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,660
 Let me tell you more about this on this one.

797
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,920
 Number five, you can inspect his self-control.

798
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,260
 Number five, inspect his self-control.

799
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,780
 It says in verse three, not given to drunkenness,

800
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,400
 not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome,

801
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,580
 not a lover of money.

802
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,660
 It's interesting that some of the ladies are like,

803
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,220
 I want someone who has a lot of money.

804
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,540
 People who have a lot of money tend to love money.

805
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,000
 So be careful with that because it says

806
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,080
 you don't want someone who loves money, all right?

807
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,800
 So it's not about him having a lot of money.

808
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,100
 It's about him being able to work hard to provide for you.

809
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,620
 That's a part of it, right?

810
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,940
 And so let's just talk about what this verse says

811
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,780
 to inspect.

812
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
 It says a few things here.

813
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,940
 I'm gonna give you three A's after the not loving money.

814
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,700
 It says, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle

815
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,380
 and not quarrelsome.

816
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,340
 And so it's not, so you can inspect alcohol,

817
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,020
 anger and adultery under self-control.

818
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,740
 Alcohol, anger and adultery.

819
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,380
 Alcohol, are they sober-minded, right?

820
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,100
 If you go on that first date and he throws back

821
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,660
 three Mambo taxis, right?

822
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,860
 This is a red flag.

823
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,060
 This ain't your dude, man.

824
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
 Like move on.

825
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,540
 Like this is not your guy.

826
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,340
 If you've seen him drunk, like y'all have been on,

827
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,740
 you've seen him intoxicated, here's what he's saying.

828
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,020
 I'm not scared of you, God.

829
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,220
 I know your word says don't get drunk,

830
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,140
 but I'm gonna do what I want, okay?

831
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,140
 And ladies, like some of you, you don't care

832
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,100
 if he gets drunk because you get drunk and you know it.

833
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,540
 And man, just, hey, I would just reconsider.

834
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,820
 I reconsider, all right?

835
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,780
 There's a God, he loves you.

836
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,660
 He's given you some instructions, not to rip you off

837
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,960
 but to set you free, all right?

838
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,820
 Is he angry?

839
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,520
 It says gentle, not violent, not quarrelsome.

840
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,180
 Is he given a rage when things don't go his way?

841
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,020
 This is a big red flag.

842
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,300
 If he's yelling at you, he's throwing stuff.

843
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,060
 If he puts his hands on you, you run,

844
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
 you delete the number, you block it,

845
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,560
 restraining order, like never again.

846
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,640
 Like there's no second chance on that in dating.

847
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,860
 No second chance in dating, all right?

848
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,380
 That's a single issue disqualifier,

849
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,660
 like we talked about in voting last week,

850
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,620
 the real truth real quick.

851
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,980
 That's a single issue disqualifier, all right?

852
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,580
 We, there was a girl and a guy,

853
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,540
 we were about to get married,

854
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,500
 and right before the wedding, we had heard some things

855
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,180
 that he had an abusive history.

856
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,100
 And so I mean right before the wedding,

857
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,660
 like days before, we reached out to her,

858
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,580
 said hey, like did you know this?

859
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,980
 She was like hey, I didn't know that

860
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,540
 but I don't even know if it's true.

861
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,860
 I think I know the real him.

862
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,540
 And we're like hey, we really think

863
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,580
 that you should delay this wedding,

864
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,900
 at least to do a little bit more research here.

865
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,540
 So angry, like gave the church the double bird,

866
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,420
 hey, I don't wanna talk to you guys anymore,

867
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,700
 like get out of our business, you don't understand,

868
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,240
 you're just not for us, you know?

869
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,860
 They go somewhere else, they get married.

870
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,100
 They go on the honeymoon.

871
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,000
 They come back, he throws her down a flight of stairs,

872
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,200
 breaks both of her legs.

873
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,800
 And we're there to pick up the pieces.

874
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,960
 It's not I told you so time, it's not what this is about.

875
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,960
 It's about hey, as you check that reputation,

876
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,800
 you wanna make sure that he doesn't give full vent

877
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,900
 to his anger because that's not God's man.

878
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,500
 That dude's gonna discipline your children, all right?

879
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,600
 Be wise in the way that you think about that.

880
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,840
 It says he's temperate, verse two,

881
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,720
 that he's marked by self-restraint and discipline, right?

882
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,540
 Like not laziness and drunkenness or indulging his flesh.

883
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,900
 This is the last A is adultery.

884
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,240
 I get this email all the time.

885
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,740
 Hey, my boyfriend's looking at porn, what do I do?

886
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:30,240
 Like let me tell you how I interpret that

887
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,400
 as a former porn addict.

888
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,320
 If we don't know each other,

889
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,280
 there's not a lot of judgment here.

890
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,920
 I've looked at more porn than any of you.

891
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,700
 That's the truth, all right?

892
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,220
 That's who's talking to you right now.

893
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,280
 But I found freedom and sobriety

894
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
 from that struggle by God's grace.

895
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,760
 And so when you say, hey, my boyfriend's looking at porn,

896
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,380
 what do I do, here's what I read.

897
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,840
 My boyfriend's cheating on me repeatedly, what do I do?

898
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,640
 And my answer is the same.

899
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,840
 You break up and you let him get well.

900
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,420
 You let him get well.

901
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,820
 And I know you hate that answer.

902
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,980
 You're like no, it's gotta be something,

903
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,600
 there's no grace in that.

904
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,000
 Yes, you let him get well.

905
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,120
 That's what grace is.

906
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,120
 Let him heal.

907
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,380
 Say, hey, I want you to go through a recovery program

908
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,000
 because this is messing you up.

909
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,400
 You're not just cheating on me sexually.

910
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,620
 An addiction to porn is not an addiction to sex.

911
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,400
 An addiction to porn is an addiction to variety.

912
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,620
 That man will never be satisfied

913
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,060
 in a monogamous relationship.

914
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,400
 It will never happen.

915
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,780
 He's programmed his brain for a variety type of girls

916
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,760
 all the time, hundreds and hundreds of images.

917
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,200
 I know it is incredibly hurtful

918
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,080
 and I know it is incredibly difficult

919
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,760
 'cause you think, man, if I let him go,

920
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,560
 will somebody else come around?

921
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,840
 That's where you get to trust God.

922
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,240
 That's what faith is.

923
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,760
 All right, as my friend has said it very well up here,

924
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,240
 you do not lower your standards,

925
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,520
 you lengthen your patience.

926
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,800
 You do not lower your standards,

927
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,880
 you lengthen your patience.

928
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,100
 Well, how long, how long do I gotta be patient?

929
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,400
 I don't know.

930
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,600
 That's the truth.

931
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,200
 I have no idea.

932
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,240
 But I know you're better off single

933
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,680
 than married to a porn addict.

934
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,240
 I believe that.

935
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,480
 Now, of course, if you're married

936
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,320
 or you're in that relationship,

937
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,560
 my instruction looks different

938
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,360
 'cause now two have become one flesh

939
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,640
 and the recovery looks different,

940
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,200
 but he still needs to get well.

941
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,240
 It blows my mind.

942
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,160
 Jennifer Lawrence said this

943
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,600
 about when some naked pictures

944
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,520
 that she had texted her boyfriends leaked.

945
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,760
 She said, "I was in a loving, healthy,

946
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
 "great relationship for four years.

947
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,080
 "It was long distance,

948
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,120
 "and either your boyfriend is going to look at porn

949
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,960
 "or he's going to look at you."

950
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:48,080
 And I think Jennifer needs Christ first.

951
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,920
 I think she needs to come to the porch.

952
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,600
 And girls, can I just say this real quick,

953
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,320
 public service announcement, all right?

954
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,440
 Like, we just got real talk real quick.

955
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,840
 And guys, for you too, I mean,

956
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,600
 this might serve you really well

957
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,200
 if you leave with nothing else but Jesus in this.

958
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,280
 It'll be helpful.

959
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,800
 The internet is not safe.

960
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,320
 All right, I know you thought that,

961
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
 that connection between your cell phone

962
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,360
 and his cell phone was so secure.

963
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,320
 And I know he promised you

964
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,880
 he wasn't gonna show those pictures to anyone,

965
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,840
 but people do weird things when they get hurt.

966
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,760
 And a lot of times in relationships, they get hurt.

967
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
 And so if you send him any pictures of you,

968
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,880
 you just assume the whole world is gonna see that.

969
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,200
 Don't do it.

970
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,040
 Don't do it.

971
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,640
 I would tell Jennifer that there's a lot of guys

972
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,080
 that aren't looking at porn or touching their girlfriends

973
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,360
 or touching themselves for that matter.

974
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,720
 I remember when I came to Watermark,

975
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,000
 like, for the first time, like, straight out of the world,

976
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,600
 right, straight out of uptown,

977
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,320
 and I get plugged into this small group,

978
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,040
 and they're going around, like, prayer requests,

979
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,640
 and one guy's like, "Hey, I got something to celebrate."

980
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,480
 And I'm like, "What?"

981
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,640
 You know, we're like, "What, what is it?"

982
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,680
 And he goes, "I haven't masturbated in three years."

983
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,360
 And I was like, "Dude, and you're still alive?"

984
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,000
 Like, is that even possible?

985
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,400
 I didn't even know that was possible.

986
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,040
 And like, and just in case you didn't laugh just then,

987
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
 because you're like, "You're still alive?"

988
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,160
 It is possible.

989
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,840
 You can wage war like that.

990
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,200
 Like, you don't have to just embrace sexual immorality

991
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,400
 because it's the norm around you.

992
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,920
 Like, you literally can wage war here, all right?

993
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,520
 Let me tell you what the Scripture says.

994
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,040
 1 Thessalonians chapter four, it says that,

995
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,240
 "Each of you should learn to control your own body

996
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,960
 "in a way that is holy and honorable,

997
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,920
 "not in passionate lust like the pagans

998
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,520
 "who do not know God, and that in this matter,

999
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,080
 "no one should wrong or take advantage

1000
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,160
 "of a brother or sister."

1001
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,400
 And then this is a terrifying verse.

1002
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,600
 This is a great Halloween verse right here.

1003
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,240
 It really is scary, because it says,

1004
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,040
 "The Lord will punish all those who commit such sins."

1005
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,440
 As we told you and warned you before.

1006
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
 Another version says,

1007
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,600
 "The Lord is the avenger of such things."

1008
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,400
 And so, ladies, one way to know if he is self-controlled,

1009
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
 it's that he's not trying to put his hand up your shirt

1010
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,600
 or down your pants, okay?

1011
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,600
 He's restraining his fleshly desire

1012
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,960
 because he honors the marriage covenant.

1013
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,120
 That guy is leading you ladies very, very well.

1014
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,100
 So please don't be like,

1015
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,680
 "Oh, he must not be attracted to me

1016
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,320
 "because he's not very physical."

1017
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,720
 No, he's waging war.

1018
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,400
 He's in a battle, okay?

1019
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,480
 Like respect that as much as you can.

1020
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,680
 Like honor that, say, "Thank you

1021
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,360
 "for the way that you respect my body

1022
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,360
 "and the way that you are waging war to make it to marriage."

1023
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,880
 That's a beautiful thing.

1024
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,880
 The last thing that you inspect is his truth.

1025
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,580
 What does he see as truth?

1026
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,300
 It says, "They must keep hold of the deep truths

1027
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,380
 "of the faith with a clear conscience."

1028
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,460
 That's verse nine.

1029
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,280
 It says in verse two,

1030
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,560
 "Now the overseer is to be above reproach

1031
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,620
 "and able to teach."

1032
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,460
 Able to teach what?

1033
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,000
 To teach the Bible that he's been poured into,

1034
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,420
 that he has the word of God written on his heart.

1035
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,580
 Hey, it's been, well, we're talking about cars

1036
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,060
 and it's been said about guys,

1037
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,780
 like one of the reputations men have

1038
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,500
 is that we don't like to ask for directions, okay?

1039
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,260
 What I would tell you is don't date a guy

1040
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,540
 that's not constantly asking him for direction.

1041
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,720
 Where should I go?

1042
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,740
 What should I do?

1043
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,100
 How should I think?

1044
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,540
 How should I treat her?

1045
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,740
 Where should I look?

1046
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,420
 What am I committed to?

1047
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,220
 But he's constantly asking for direction.

1048
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,620
 And so I would ask you, what determines his truth?

1049
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,080
 Is it convenience?

1050
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,320
 Has he built his life on the word of God?

1051
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,860
 Is that his firm foundation?

1052
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,940
 Does he demonstrate to the world integrity,

1053
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,780
 that he surrendered to the Holy Spirit,

1054
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,140
 that he's trustworthy?

1055
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,340
 Does he do the right thing?

1056
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,380
 Like this is so simple.

1057
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,060
 Sometimes I really think that if you've trusted in Christ,

1058
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,780
 like and as you pursue and worship him,

1059
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,780
 life can be as simple as do the right thing.

1060
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,100
 Faced with a choice, there's this and there's this,

1061
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,180
 just do the right thing.

1062
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,360
 It says about David, that he was a man

1063
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,080
 after God's own heart.

1064
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,440
 And in Acts 13, I think it's verse 22,

1065
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,120
 God clarifies, here's what I meant when I said

1066
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,320
 David was a man after my heart.

1067
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
 He did everything I asked him to do.

1068
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,600
 He was fully surrendered to my word.

1069
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,840
 That's what it looks like to be a man after God's heart.

1070
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,800
 You do everything God asks you to do.

1071
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,720
 Let me tell you something, there's this guy

1072
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,960
 that I've been in community with for 14 years.

1073
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,260
 14 years we ran together, he and I are very different,

1074
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,220
 couldn't be more different.

1075
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,660
 Like we think with two different sides of the brain.

1076
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,140
 And I will tell you, I told him the other day,

1077
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,460
 I said, hey, I want you to know something.

1078
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,620
 I trust you more than I trust any other single human being

1079
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,660
 other than my wife.

1080
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,780
 And the reason is, is because I've seen this brother

1081
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,700
 make really hard decisions, he does the right thing

1082
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,820
 even when it's not his decision.

1083
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,600
 He does the right thing even when it's hard.

1084
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,800
 He has the conversations, he doesn't gossip,

1085
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,320
 he follows the law, even when it's hard,

1086
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,160
 even when he wouldn't get caught,

1087
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,040
 he just does the right thing.

1088
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,840
 And I asked him if I could share that.

1089
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,400
 And so his wife called me this morning,

1090
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,680
 she says, hey, before you tell thousands of people

1091
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,280
 that about my husband, you tell them,

1092
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,780
 hey, that's why I married him.

1093
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,760
 Because I saw that in his life.

1094
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,800
 I saw that no matter how difficult it was,

1095
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,440
 that he did the right thing.

1096
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,660
 And so you need someone who holds onto truth

1097
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,720
 and he lives by it.

1098
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:57,400
 Girls, I don't know, I get confused why you like bad boys.

1099
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,520
 Let me ask you, let me just ask you girls,

1100
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,960
 ladies, I'm asking.

1101
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,160
 Do y'all like bad boys, like bad guys?

1102
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,000
 Y'all like them?

1103
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,960
 Yeah, Harley Davidson.

1104
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,580
 Like, I'm gonna use that, I'll go off that, okay?

1105
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,860
 I mean, true story, like,

1106
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,240
 I'm driving this thing yesterday.

1107
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,280
 I'm about to pull out on the road.

1108
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,480
 Two girls whip around, like in the parking lot,

1109
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,320
 pull around, pull up beside me, roll down their window.

1110
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,600
 They say, hey baby, can we get a ride?

1111
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,760
 Now let me tell you something,

1112
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,260
 I'm a middle-aged man with three kids.

1113
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,960
 Like, I understand that they are not attracted to me.

1114
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
 You know?

1115
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,380
 But if you can put off a bad boy persona,

1116
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,000
 it seems like you guys are attracted to that.

1117
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,760
 And God doesn't say be attracted to Harley Davidsons.

1118
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,560
 All right?

1119
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,800
 He gives you other things to be attracted to.

1120
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,620
 He says, hey, I want you to look at this list.

1121
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,200
 This is what I want you to follow.

1122
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,960
 This is what you're after.

1123
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,880
 So let me ask you again, ladies, do you like bad guys?

1124
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,180
 It seems to me like you do.

1125
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,680
 Now, let me show you.

1126
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,840
 Do you know who this is right here?

1127
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,000
 Y'all know who that is?

1128
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,880
 That's Nicholas Cruz.

1129
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,820
 All right, he walked into a school in Parkland, Florida

1130
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,680
 and killed 17 people, he shot 'em dead.

1131
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,320
 He goes into jail, he goes to jail,

1132
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,840
 he's waiting to be tried,

1133
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,220
 and he starts getting an influx of love letters.

1134
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,840
 I'll read to you, this is what they say.

1135
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,760
 Longtime Bowery County public defender, Howard,

1136
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,000
 said he's never seen a defendant get so many letters,

1137
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,680
 not even close, hundreds of letters sent to him

1138
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,840
 of those made public by the Bowery County Sheriff's Office.

1139
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,520
 There wasn't one letter that criticized the confessed killer.

1140
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,240
 No, they asked if he could have,

1141
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,680
 or if they could have his baby.

1142
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,520
 They sent him seductive pictures of themselves.

1143
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,760
 Who were the letters from?

1144
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,500
 Girls.

1145
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,900
 Hey, I know you killed 17 people,

1146
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,720
 but I find you attractive, attractive.

1147
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,040
 And you're right, it's dysfunctional.

1148
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,960
 You're right, here's what every lady thinks,

1149
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,160
 like yeah, but not, like that's crazy

1150
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,560
 that he would get a lot of, that's crazy.

1151
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,920
 But consider this, ladies.

1152
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,680
 How many times have you been in a relationship

1153
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,720
 with a guy that you knew was gonna hurt you?

1154
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,680
 How many times have you dated someone

1155
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,580
 when you knew he was not good for you?

1156
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,140
 How many times have you gone back

1157
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,580
 to someone who broke your heart and hurt you?

1158
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,720
 As you go, I would never do that with that guy.

1159
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,440
 And yet we practice it in these small microcosms.

1160
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,040
 We think yeah, there is a part of me.

1161
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,160
 I think Satan delights in the reality

1162
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,600
 that you find something rebellious, attractive.

1163
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,480
 And what it's doing is you're like,

1164
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,160
 well, there's no guys, there's no good guys out there.

1165
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,880
 No, I'm telling you, I'm looking out here

1166
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,980
 and there are some good guys in the room.

1167
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,560
 There are some good guys in the room

1168
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,640
 that are doing the right things,

1169
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,940
 that are following God, that are seeking to surrender to God.

1170
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:23,240
 I just wanna end by saying you're a princess.

1171
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,940
 You're a daughter to the king.

1172
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:30,600
 And it seems like, and ladies,

1173
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,760
 I don't mean to be hard on you.

1174
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,660
 I really, my heart is to help you.

1175
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,100
 But in that competitive spirit,

1176
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,140
 it seems that you're attracted to guys in relationships.

1177
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,780
 That's always confused me too.

1178
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,700
 Like before I was in a relationship with Christ,

1179
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,860
 I can remember being out in the scene

1180
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,620
 and talking with a girl and it going places

1181
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,980
 where it goes in the world.

1182
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,500
 And me just saying, hey, I have a girlfriend.

1183
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,460
 And her just saying, hey, I don't care.

1184
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,240
 And so we would use each other and we would have fun.

1185
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,360
 And so I'm gonna end really controversial.

1186
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,220
 I'm gonna end by saying something really crazy.

1187
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,180
 Ladies, you might look for a guy who's in a relationship.

1188
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,700
 Like, well, just think about it

1189
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,860
 'cause you can observe these things, right?

1190
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,420
 If he's in a relationship,

1191
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,600
 you can look at his commitments.

1192
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,380
 In summary, if he's in a relationship,

1193
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,880
 you can look at his humility.

1194
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,860
 If he's in a relationship,

1195
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,200
 you can kind of see his reputation.

1196
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,940
 If he's in a relationship, you can see if he initiates,

1197
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,020
 if he takes initiative.

1198
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,240
 If he's in a relationship,

1199
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,060
 you can see if he's self-controlled.

1200
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,500
 If he's in a relationship,

1201
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,080
 you can see what truth he surrendered to.

1202
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,980
 And so I want you to find a guy who is in a relationship

1203
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,900
 and no, I'm not talking about a relationship

1204
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:00,720
 with another girl.

1205
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,920
 I'm talking about a relationship with Christ.

1206
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,200
 (congregation applauding)

1207
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,540
 That he would be surrendered to Jesus.

1208
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,020
 It's interesting when that guy brought this thing over.

1209
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,500
 He drove it over to my house.

1210
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,340
 It's like, man, I don't know,

1211
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,740
 I'm gonna drive it with the check engine light on.

1212
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,940
 He brings it over and my kids are going crazy.

1213
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,140
 They're like, "Daddy, what?

1214
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:29,980
 "Can we keep it?"

1215
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,820
 I'm like, "No."

1216
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,220
 And they love it.

1217
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,060
 And I should've known at this point the deal was done.

1218
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,980
 I should've known.

1219
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,180
 He goes, "Yeah, for me, I just think of it like a jet ski."

1220
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,140
 And I said, "What do you mean?"

1221
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,880
 He goes, "Well, it's kind of fun for the weekend,

1222
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,180
 "but then you're over it."

1223
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,420
 I thought about that.

1224
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,420
 I was like, "Yeah."

1225
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,900
 That's kind of how it works when you make a decision

1226
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,960
 based on how something is on the outside.

1227
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,880
 Right, it's not very functional.

1228
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,900
 You can't take passengers or carry cargo or do anything.

1229
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,140
 It's not a very functional.

1230
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,820
 In fact, there's only one reason you would buy that car,

1231
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,580
 because you're looking for a good time.

1232
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,740
 You're looking for a fun experience.

1233
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,380
 Ladies, some of you,

1234
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,060
 some of you aren't looking for a husband.

1235
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,100
 You're looking for an adventure.

1236
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,740
 And I would really challenge you on that,

1237
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,780
 to seek out a husband.

1238
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,060
 In fact, as I was thinking about that,

1239
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,300
 I thought about my truck.

1240
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,500
 My truck is 13 years old.

1241
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,700
 It's got 100,000 miles on it.

1242
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,700
 It's been faithful to me.

1243
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,140
 When I turn the key, it starts.

1244
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,260
 It's the base model.

1245
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,060
 It didn't have power locks or power windows or power seats.

1246
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
 It didn't have anything.

1247
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,860
 You know what's sexy about my truck?

1248
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,580
 Nothing.

1249
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,140
 You get inside, it kind of stinks a little bit.

1250
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,140
 It smells like a boy's lived in it for 13 years.

1251
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,260
 Right?

1252
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,180
 But it's never been in the shop.

1253
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,180
 It just works.

1254
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,140
 It just runs.

1255
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,540
 And so ladies, what if instead of sexy,

1256
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,940
 you looked for surrender to Christ?

1257
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:15,140
 Instead of sexy, you held out for surrender to Christ.

1258
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,540
 Because is Christ not the perfect example of this?

1259
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,860
 Like Christ was committed.

1260
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,860
 The scripture says about him that he was humble.

1261
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,860
 His reputation, we still read about it 2,000 years later

1262
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,020
 that he saved those who trusted in him.

1263
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,100
 He took initiative.

1264
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,020
 He went first.

1265
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,940
 He says, "For the joy set before him,

1266
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,820
 "he died for your sins."

1267
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,660
 He was controlled by the Holy Spirit.

1268
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,060
 He said he was tempted in every way, but never sinned.

1269
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,460
 He was self-controlled.

1270
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:51,460
 And he was the truth, the word of God in the flesh.

1271
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,060
 That is who we follow.

1272
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,260
 And so ladies, you're looking for someone who follows him,

1273
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,660
 someone who is in a committed relationship with him.

1274
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,980
 If you have that, those other things, they'll follow suit.

1275
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,540
 This is the gold standard.

1276
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,700
 All of those things, they may ebb and flow.

1277
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,900
 It may be in different degrees,

1278
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,020
 but if he's fully surrendered to Christ,

1279
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,660
 he's gonna be a great husband.

1280
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,780
 He's gonna be a great father.

1281
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,060
 Let me pray you find that.

1282
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,140
 Father, we thank you for the example of your son, Jesus.

1283
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,300
 We thank you for what you did for us through him.

1284
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:40,980
 Father, I pray for my female friends in the room.

1285
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:46,460
 God, they're scared.

1286
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,220
 They don't wanna be single forever.

1287
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,860
 Lord, it's easy, the enemy tempts us to think

1288
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,420
 that you've forgotten about us,

1289
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,660
 that you don't have a plan for us.

1290
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,620
 Father, would you remind them that you love them

1291
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,220
 and you do have a plan for them?

1292
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:05,940
 That first and foremost,

1293
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,220
 you desire for them to be married to you.

1294
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,540
 And then Lord, I pray out of this group

1295
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:17,660
 that you would raise up men, real men,

1296
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,420
 confident in your Holy Spirit,

1297
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,700
 surrendered to your Holy Spirit,

1298
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,140
 who would engage women that are surrendered

1299
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,620
 to your Holy Spirit,

1300
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,500
 and that they would get married and have children.

1301
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,780
 Your kingdom would be advanced through that.

1302
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,740
 Father, would you change, would you tune our hearts

1303
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,180
 in the list that we're looking for?

1304
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,220
 You know, whether she's tall or blonde or brunette

1305
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,220
 or whether he's a doctor or lawyer or, you know, built,

1306
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,100
 that we would tune it to.

1307
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,820
 Are they surrendered to Christ?

1308
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,860
 Would you make that enough for us, please?

1309
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,580
 Even as we worship you now, in Jesus' name, amen.

1310
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:05,580
