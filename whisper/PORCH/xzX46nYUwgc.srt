00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 We are launching into, launching into a brand new series on dating and relationships.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 And hopefully extracting from God's word helpful principles related to all things love and of course marriage.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Now, when I was around 20, you know, college, shortly after college, I realized that I was ignorant of wedding invitation protocol.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Specifically as it related to when you received an invitation to a wedding, the rules, unspoken rules, if you will, as it relates to who you can attend and can attend with.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Here's what I mean.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I would receive those invitations and like all through college, really until I got married and we had to do our own invitations.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 It would be an invitation, a friend was getting married and I'd open it up and it would say, you know, number of guests, one.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And I assumed that if you're invited to a wedding, you can always bring a date.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 No matter if they have a plus one or not.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 So I would just cross out the plus one and I would put two on there.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And every wedding I went to as a single unmarried person, I always brought a date with me.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I just thought, you know, of course, if I'm going to a wedding, I'm going to bring a date.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Whether I was dating someone or not, it just was a part of it.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Like there were multiple, in fact, on one occasion I brought two because I was just like, yeah, we're bringing a couple of friends.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 It's going to be a party.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's going to be great.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 In fact, the way that I met my wife was I got invited to a wedding up here in Dallas.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 It's like when we were in college and the way I started dating my wife and I got an invitation and I did what I had done because I didn't know there was a rule that if they only say you can come, only you come.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I was like, no, more than marriage.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It's going to be a party.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And an hour or two before I left College Station to head to Dallas for this wedding, I bumped into my wife's best friend at the time.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I wasn't dating my wife or anything.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I was like, hey, do you have plans this weekend?

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You want to go to a wedding?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 We got in the car, went up to a wedding.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And later that night ended up dating or ended up hanging out with my wife and my wedding date, which was my wife's best friend at the time.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I just didn't know there was certain protocol and rules on, you know, when you get that invitation, this is only for you.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 In fact, I think we should change that rule, that that's a story for another time.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Now, what does that have to do with what we're going to talk about?

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Well, really in this entire series, just like in that scenario of not knowing who to bring to the wedding, who's in bounds and who's not, what's appropriate and what's not.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 This whole series is aimed at giving clarity as best we can from God's Word on who you should bring to the wedding.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Not any wedding. Your wedding.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 In other words, the type of person to date, how to date, and to look for and to be in dating and eventually in marriage.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And our attempt to extract from God's Word principles as it relates to dating in a way that aligns with God's best.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 As it relates to the importance of this topic, because I know in the room there's certain people are like, oh my gosh, a dating series.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Just a reminder that I'm single again.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And there's other people who are like, just chomping at the bit.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 You're like, I don't come to the porch any other Tuesday. I'm just here for this. I'm looking for love. I'm looking for love.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It's the spectrum in the room.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The nervous laughter is typically the people who are there.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But there are a few things that in your life are going to make as significant of an impact on your future as who you marry.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And the thing that's going to impact and determine who you marry is who you date and how you date.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 80% of the room statistically will get married by around the age of 35.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Now that's not a guarantee, but that's statistically likely.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I mean, think about that. That's an enormous percentage.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 That means everybody but this section is getting married.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And I apologize. And you guys are going to be single for forever.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 You're really excited about that.

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I mean, statistically, that's likely.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And so if that decision and evaluation is coming up, and maybe you're in that season right now,

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 and there's relationships that exist inside of the room,

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 and how would God have you date one another, honor one another?

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Maybe you're in a season of singleness, and you feel like God may be preparing or calling you,

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 and there is somebody that you should date.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And so we're going to spend time just talking all throughout about what it looks like to date well,

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 who to look for as it relates to a guy, who to look for as it relates to a girl, how to date,

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 and what God's Word has to say about that.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 But tonight, I want to speak to a very specific group in the room.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And it is a group that may not even identify with the next sentence I'm going to say,

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 but you are single, and you are not ready to mingle.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And by that, I don't mean that you are not interested in dating.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You may not even be interested in dating.

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But as it relates to is it wise right now for you to date, the answer would be no.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 That there's a season that you should spend solidifying your relationship with the Lord,

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 getting healthy, working through, and preparing for that season of dating.

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Candidly, there are some couples in the room that we're going to look at three reasons

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 or three scenarios of when you should not date.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And these scenarios may apply to you and your relationship.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And the last thing I want is for you to come in here and feel beat down, feel discouraged, feel any of that.

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But I do want to provide clarity because it is such an enormous decision

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 that's going to impact your future and your life.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Next to trusting in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, who's going to be your master?

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Who will be the mate that you walk through life with?

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 For anyone who's going to get married, it's the most significant decision you're going to make.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And so God, because He loves you, wants to provide wisdom and truth and principles

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 and does all throughout the scripture on the type of marriage and type of woman to look for.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Now, I want to start by looking at a story in John chapter 3 as we look at these three things.

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 John chapter 4, I saw it. I apologize.

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 In John chapter 4, we're introduced to arguably the most relationally dysfunctional person in all of the Bible.

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And she is currently single or she's currently unmarried.

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 By single, I mean unmarried.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And Jesus pursues this woman and what makes up her relational history and baggage

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 has some overlap with the three things and three times scenarios where you should not date.

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And if these apply to you, it may be time for you to hit the brakes on the relationship,

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 to hit pause on dating in general, and to strengthen and solidify your relationship with the Lord.

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Because you're never going to get a relationship with a spouse right if you don't have a relationship with the Lord right.

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And God loves you. And He wants you to experience all of His best in the dating context.

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 But we're going to look at this woman. I'm going to fly through the story and then extract a few things

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 out of these three scenarios of when not to date.

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And in John chapter 4, starting in verse 4, it says this.

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Talking about Jesus.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 "Now he had to go through Samaria."

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Now this is interesting and I'll move quick here, but when it says Jesus had to go through Samaria, that's unusual.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 John, when he wrote this, his audience, the readers, would have gone, "What?"

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Because Jewish men and women, they didn't go through Samaria.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Samaria was kind of a neighboring country and area and they had hostility with the Jewish people.

103
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 It was just like, "We got bad blood."

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And so they wouldn't go through that area because there was racial tension and hostility.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 But Jesus says, "I don't operate like everybody does. I have to go through Samaria."

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Because there is a woman that I want to meet and I have a conversation plan to take place.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 So Jesus says, "We're going through Samaria."

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar.

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So it begins to explain where they go in Samaria, this area.

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 "It was near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Jacob's well was there. Jesus was tired from his journey, sat down by the well, and it was about noon

112
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 when a Samaritan woman came to draw water.

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And Jesus said to her, 'Will you give me a drink?'

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 His disciples had gone in town to buy food.

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You're a Jew and I'm a Samaritan woman.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 How can you ask me for a drink?'

117
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 For Jews do not associate with Samaritans,'" John says.

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So it's the middle of the day. It's blazing heat.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Jesus sits down at this well. It's the Middle East.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It's 100 plus degrees outside, incredibly hot.

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And someone shows up at the well that would have been unexpected, an unusual time.

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 You didn't go to the well to get water in the blazing heat of the day,

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 unless you were trying to avoid people.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And we're going to discover this woman had a lot of relational baggage.

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 She had a past. She had a present.

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 She had some real shame that she carried.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 In other words, Samaritans were outcasts.

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 She was an outcast of outcasts.

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 She's going to the well at noon to avoid people.

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And she shows up, and her worst case scenario that she can imagine is sitting at the well.

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 It's not just there's people around.

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 There's a man here, and it's not just any man.

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 It is a Jewish man. Jews don't like women like me.

134
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And then he asks her for a drink, which to us, you know, we're like, 'Is that really a big deal?'

135
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 He's saying, 'Can I use--can we share the same cup?

136
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 I'm going to associate myself with you.'

137
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 So of course she's perplexed.

138
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And that day, men didn't talk to women who are not their wives,

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 and he's not just talking to her.

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 He's asking her, 'Can I have a drink?'

141
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Jesus answered in her response to, 'How can you ask me?'

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And he says a line that only Jesus could get away with.

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.

145
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So imagine, you're this lady. You're sitting at the well.

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 There's this stranger that's sitting there.

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I mean, to us, we read that, and we see the imagery.

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 We know it's an illustration. It's beautiful.

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 You would ask me, it would give you living water.

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 But when you're a Samaritan woman who carries all kinds of shame in the blazing heat of the day,

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and you show up, and there's some guy who asks you for a drink,

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 and then says, 'You know what? In fact, you should have asked me,

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 and I would have given you water that's alive.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 It's not beautiful. It's weird.'

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And so she's going, 'Water that is alive? What are you talking about?'

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And she rightfully goes, 'Sir, you don't even have anything to draw the water with,

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and it's a deep well. Where can you get this living water?

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Are you greater than our father Jacob, basically the guy who made this well,

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?'

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Jesus answered, 'Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.

161
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 But whoever drinks the water that I give them will never thirst.

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 The water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.'"

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Jesus is using a metaphor, and he's saying,

164
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 just like that physical water quenches your physical thirst,

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 I offer a satisfaction, something that can quench your spiritual thirst.

166
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I offer a lasting satisfaction that nothing else in this world can provide.

167
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 "Sir," the woman said, I'm sorry, then the woman said to him,

168
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 "Sir, give me this water so I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So she's still not connecting the dots and still doesn't get it.

170
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 She's just going, 'Give me the alive water so I don't ever have to come back here.'

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And here's where Jesus begins to lovingly just lean in.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 He said, "Go and call your husband and come back."

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 She replied, "I have no husband."

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And Jesus said, "You're right when you say you have no husband.

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 The fact is you've had five husbands,

176
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 and the one, and the man that you have now or are sleeping with, living with now is not your husband.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 What you have said is quite true."

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And now we begin to understand why this woman was showing up in the middle of the hottest part of the day

179
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 when no one else would be around to get water.

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 She carries this shame and baggage, relational brokenness.

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 I mean, five divorces in that day and age was unbelievable.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 I mean, it's unbelievable in today's.

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's very rare in today's day and age at that time.

184
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And she had become so relationally dysfunctional that eventually she just gave up and was like,

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 "As long as he'll sleep with me, I don't even care.

186
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 He didn't have to commit with me."

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And now she's living with a man who's not even married to her.

188
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And so she changes the subject and as a response to being uncomfortable of like,

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 "How does this guy know everything, all of my baggage?"

190
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And she says, "Well, I can see that you're a prophet, and riddle me this, prophet."

191
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And she asked a religious question, and then Jesus gives an answer to it.

192
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And then she says, "I know."

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 The woman said, "I know that the Messiah, who's called the Christ, is coming.

194
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And when he comes, he'll explain everything to us."

195
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And then Jesus declared, "I, the one speaking to you, I am he."

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 The very first occasion that Jesus introduces himself and reveals that he is the Messiah

197
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 is to this outcast of outcasts, where he looks her in the eyes and says,

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 "I'm the one you've been waiting for."

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 The longest conversation that Jesus has in all of the New Testament is with this woman.

200
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 The most relationally broken, dysfunctional woman in the Bible

201
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 occupies the greatest amount of time of the Son of God in terms of communication.

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 So let's just set the record straight.

203
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Whatever brokenness and whatever issues and dysfunction

204
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 that is a part of your relational history or current history,

205
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 if you were in the presence of Jesus himself, you wouldn't feel shame.

206
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 You'd feel pursued.

207
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And this entire night is going to be an attempt to learn from some of the parallels

208
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 and ways that we look for relationships to feel something that they can't.

209
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But if you leave here and you feel shame and guilt and be down, that's on me,

210
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 because if Jesus was here, you wouldn't feel that.

211
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And if you feel convicted to change habits, that's on the Spirit.

212
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And so I want to look at three things that are really parallels to this woman's incredible story

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 and parallel to the ruts that she was in that we can find ourselves in

214
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 and three reasons that you and I should not date

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 or three signs that you were not ready to date.

216
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So the first one, you were dating delusional.

217
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You were dating delusional.

218
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Let me explain what I mean.

219
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Each of us is going to be a D.

220
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Delusional is when you are deceived.

221
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You're underneath the--you believe something that's not true.

222
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 It's akin to thinking and believing in lies.

223
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 This woman had likely fallen into a myth that a lot of us fall in today,

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 which is, "Man, if I could just find the right person, then this relationship would work."

225
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And after one failed marriage, after another failed marriage, after another,

226
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 and constantly going, you know, "The problem is him.

227
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 I just need to find the right person."

228
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And it's delusional to assume that after five different broken relationships,

229
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 the problem is always them.

230
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 If you are always at the scene of the car crash, you need to begin to ask the question,

231
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 "Maybe I am part of the problem here."

232
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 If the common denominator in every broken relationship in your life is you,

233
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 then it could be worth addressing you.

234
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 This woman had bought in a delusion of, "Someone out there would be better suited for me."

235
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 Well, my fear for us, just candidly, is from the moment you could read and think

236
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and take in information from the very first time, very first memories that you have,

237
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 you have been discipled as it relates to love and dating from the world.

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Now, no one would ever call it that, but you've been discipled by Disney

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 from the time that you were five years old.

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 It's true.

241
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 You've been taught about fairy tales and love and what to look for and the hero,

242
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 and they lived happily ever after have been ingrained in your mind and my mind

243
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 from the very first breath that you took.

244
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And fairy tales, I love fairy tales.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I love a good knight in shining armor, but fairy tales will lie.

246
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Fairy tales tell you messages like, "Man, if the shoe fits, it's just going to be perfect.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 You'll live happily ever after."

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Fairy tales communicate really the same storyline.

249
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 There's always a damsel in distress.

250
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 She needs to be rescued, and you're looking for her,

251
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 and you're going to be the shining armor.

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 In dating relationships and love, you're not looking for somebody who needs to be rescued.

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 You're not looking to be the savior of somebody.

254
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You're looking for a partner in life, not a project that you're going to rescue.

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And yet this message is consistently a fairy tale idea.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And then there's the more modern ways or more recent, you know,

257
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 discipling from the world that has happened.

258
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And that looks like just the music that we listen to, the movies that we watch.

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I mean, Taylor Swift has probably discipled more people on love and the world than anybody else.

260
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 I mean, just think about all the ways that she has shaped.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I mean, I knew you were trouble when you walked in.

262
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Then why did you date him?

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But that message communicates.

264
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 I mean, every Taylor Swift song communicates the same thing, like,

265
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 "Yeah, he's bad for me, but I still like it, but he's bad for me, but I still like it."

266
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And, "Ahh!"

267
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And that communicates and begins to make you think, like,

268
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 "Man, I want to have a relationship where they kind of play the game."

269
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Like, they don't always just honor me and text me back, and they're just a little mysterious.

270
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You know what mysterious is? It's shady, okay?

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 That's what mysterious is.

272
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 When they don't communicate for three days, that's shady.

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 That's not mysterious. That's not a quality to appreciate.

274
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But that's Taylor discipling.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Call it Drake. Call it the Rom-Com series.

276
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Whether it's, you know, a Cinderella story, and whatever the name of that girl is.

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 What was her name?

278
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Hilary Duff.

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 To Rachel McAdams and the notebook.

280
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 You want to talk about dysfunction?

281
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 I mean, look at the storyline.

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And they communicate, "Man, you should be looking for something."

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And, you know, it's most important to listen to your heart and follow those feelings.

284
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And, "Oh, man, it's when the butterflies are there, you know you're in love."

285
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Here's the deal with butterflies.

286
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Those fade.

287
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Butterflies fly away.

288
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 If you follow and live for that, you're going to have feelings that--

289
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 you're going to fall in love seven times a day.

290
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 I mean, all this is informing a lot of the ways we think.

291
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Here's very specifically some of the ways that you are dating delusionally.

292
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 If you embrace that, like I already said, they lived happily ever after.

293
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 As soon as they got married, they put a ring on, happily ever after into the sunset.

294
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 That has never happened in the history of humanity and existence and marriage.

295
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Marriage is amazing, but it takes daily work and dying to self.

296
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 If you get nothing else and you just hear this point, marriage is amazing.

297
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Being married to my wife is one of the greatest gifts, but it is freaking hard.

298
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 This is not for the faint of heart, because it is called on husbands to die daily to your own desires.

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 When you sin against them, ask them for forgiveness to pursue and prioritize them above yourself.

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And same thing with wives.

301
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Paul even says this. He's saying, like, look, in 1 Corinthians 7, he's talking about marriage.

302
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 He's like, look, singleness--and I know everyone in the room is like, "Yeah, you know, I'm sure it's hard, but at least you're married."

303
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I want to just set up the fact that there's no happily ever after. It is daily going to work.

304
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Paul would say this, 1 Corinthians 7, he says, "Those who marry will face many troubles."

305
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 "Those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you of this."

306
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 You're choosing in marriage, this is somebody I am going to pursue conflict with, be sanctified with, die to yourself.

307
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 The moment you say, "I do," you are no longer you.

308
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 That person is dead and gone.

309
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And daily, you're now called to live in love.

310
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Marriage is not dissimilar to the pandemic.

311
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 This feels like a stretch, but follow me.

312
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 The pandemic, anything that was weak was exposed.

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It strengthened things that were strong, and they even grew stronger.

314
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But we saw families, businesses, churches, our world, go through the trauma and the challenge.

315
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Marriage is not traumatic. It is a daily dying to yourself, though.

316
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 It's not a happily ever after. That's a fairy tale. That's a child's way of thinking.

317
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Another way of thinking would be listen to your heart.

318
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Listen to your heart. Some of you guys have parents that tell you this.

319
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 When you're evaluating, what does your heart say?

320
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And they're often well-meaning, but the Bible says when your heart is the compass by which you live,

321
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 you're living according to a compass that will lead you to a really bad destination.

322
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 It will lie to you.

323
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It's like following a broken compass, and you're like, "I think it's north," and you're going the total wrong direction.

324
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 In Jeremiah 17, verse 9, it says, "The heart is deceitful above all things,

325
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 above anything else."

326
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Jeremiah says your heart is in its own category of how it can deceive you.

327
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 That's why some of you guys are in relationships, and you come to the porch, and you love Jesus.

328
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Sure, some of you do, or a lot of you do.

329
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 But you're dating somebody, and you know he's not who God says you should date,

330
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 or you know she's not who God says you should date.

331
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 But your heart has moved you and made you go, "Yeah, but we're working on it,

332
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and she's going to get there, and we have a song, and we just love each other,

333
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 and the hills are alive with the sound of music when I hold her hand."

334
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And that's your heart deceiving you.

335
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 The Bible says we're to have wise, just counselors, people in our life who speak into that relationship,

336
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 that listening to your heart is a foolish way to live.

337
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 It's another one, that you would embrace this delusional mindset that there is one person out there for you.

338
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 The one.

339
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Man, this is common.

340
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I mean, church Christian circles talk about this.

341
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 "Hey, there's a soulmate, and when God made them, he had you in mind."

342
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Now, that sounds really great with Justin Timberlake singing it.

343
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It's just not biblically true.

344
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 That my wife was not made for me.

345
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 She was made for God and to have a relationship with him.

346
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I wasn't made for my wife.

347
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 She's not there to complete me.

348
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I was made for a relationship with God.

349
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 There is no "the one" for you.

350
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 There is a group of people called God's people, and there is a someone from amongst that group

351
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 that has the characteristics and criteria that you can choose to pursue and to marry,

352
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 but there is no "the one" out there that you are looking for and waiting for.

353
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 You are looking for the characteristics that God lists out in Scripture

354
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 that should be exhibited in a husband or a wife and a father and a mother.

355
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 There is no "the one" not to burst the bubbles.

356
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And it sounds great, and you know, we watch the movies and it makes us go,

357
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 "Oh man, if only I could find..."

358
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But you know that's not true.

359
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Think about it. If there is just the one, with the divorce rate where it's at,

360
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 somebody missed their one, and that means like a domino effect, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

361
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 How many of us have...it's over.

362
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 There's no "the one," but you can't choose from among.

363
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You can't choose someone from among God's people,

364
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 which leads to the next one, a lie that is delusional.

365
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And this one always gets people riled up, but it's the truth.

366
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Make sure you're sexually compatible.

367
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 It's delusional.

368
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Hey, you need to make sure, you know, you wouldn't buy a car before you test drive it.

369
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 You need to make sure you guys are sexually compatible.

370
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Here, I'm going to just burst this bubble real quick, and I'm not trying to be crass.

371
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Here's how you know.

372
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 In fact, tonight, if you're in a dating relationship,

373
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 you don't have to introduce sex to know if you're sexually compatible.

374
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You can come down front.

375
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I will tell anybody that wants to know if they're sexually compatible.

376
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Here's how you know. Ready?

377
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 You're a man, and she's a woman.

378
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 God literally designed the parts.

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And I'm not saying that you should explore sexual compatibility with anyone

380
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 if they're the opposite sex.

381
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I'm saying that's a box you don't have to really worry about

382
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 as long as you're a man and she's a woman.

383
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Sex and making sure, like, hey, you've got to make sure you guys have great sexual chemistry.

384
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You have your whole marriage to figure that out.

385
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Great sex doesn't make a great relationship.

386
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Sex doesn't make a relationship.

387
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Sex makes babies.

388
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And you don't need to worry of do we have that compatibility,

389
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 which brings me to the last one.

390
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Chemistry matters more than character.

391
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Chemistry matters more than character.

392
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Chemistry is--man, I'm not saying it doesn't matter, there's not a place for it,

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 but if it comes at the expense of character,

394
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 if the thing that you celebrate and really the reason you're in love

395
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 is just, man, every time we're together and we just--we both like the Cowboys

396
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 and we both, you know, love Mexican food and we both--blue's our favorite color.

397
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And, like, if that's the foundation of your relationship and they don't have character,

398
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 that is a recipe for a disaster.

399
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Because character--chemistry doesn't get you through all the challenging things

400
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 that are in front of this room.

401
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I mean, look at the size of this room.

402
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Do you know how many miscarriages are ahead of this room?

403
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Do you know how many diagnoses of cancer are ahead of this room?

404
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Do you know how much challenging times are ahead?

405
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I mean, we have a God who can sustain and is in control and is sovereign,

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 but in those moments, you don't need to just enjoy the same music.

407
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 When you're walking through the death of a family member, you need character.

408
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And that is a higher priority.

409
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Do they tell the truth?

410
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Are they honest?

411
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Are they trustworthy?

412
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 How do they care for people around them?

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 How do they care for the family members that they have?

414
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 How do they talk about somebody when he's not around?

415
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Do they have character?

416
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Or do y'all just have chemistry?

417
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 First thing, like this lady, delusional dating.

418
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 The second thing is dating dehydrated.

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 You are dating dehydrated.

420
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Now, let me explain.

421
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I'm not talking about you need to go get a water bottle.

422
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 I'm saying this lady clearly was relationally--I mean, of all the women in the New Testament,

423
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 this girl was thirsty.

424
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Five different marriages, and now she's sleeping with a guy who's not even her husband?

425
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 We don't know all the back story and all the ways and all the reasons.

426
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 But she clearly was attempting--and the story of the Bible is Jesus saying,

427
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 "Hey, you have a physical thirst, but you have a spiritual thirst.

428
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 You're trying to fill with a man?

429
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 There's no marriage or man that can fill that.

430
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 There's no woman or wife that can fill that.

431
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Only God.

432
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 You can search for the rest of your life and discover that."

433
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 And every person who's ever been married, they quickly learn marriage doesn't change your loneliness.

434
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And you're not going to believe me, and it's easy for me to say.

435
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I get it because I'm married.

436
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 If you're right now going, "Gosh, I can't be okay without having someone in my life,

437
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 and so I'm just going to lower my standards because I'm just so tired of being lonely,"

438
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 marriage will not fix your loneliness.

439
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Marriage will fix your singleness.

440
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 But it cannot fix your loneliness because that is an internal, soul-level, only Christ-fixable problem.

441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Marriage will change your last name, but it won't change your loneliness.

442
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And it is so much better to be single and feel lonely right now

443
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and wait for someone who has the criteria that God says to look for

444
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 than to be married and lonely in the future.

445
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 It is so much better to be single today and trust God and look for the characteristics he said,

446
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 to be single and lonely today than to be married and lonely someday.

447
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 That loneliness is a far greater depth, and you probably don't believe me,

448
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 but I've been teaching on dating on this stage and at this place for 12 years,

449
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 and I have seen nothing destroy the hearts and lives of people like their toxic dating relationships,

450
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 the compromises that they've made.

451
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 And I just don't want that for you.

452
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And you've got to decide, "Man, am I looking for this relationship to fill?

453
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 I'm looking for something to fill a hole in me that maybe they can't fill."

454
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Because they can't.

455
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 You're dating dehydrated.

456
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 You want to approach dating as a whole person, W-H-O-L-E, "I'm a whole person.

457
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I'm complete in Christ. If they don't complete me, I'm complete in Christ."

458
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Not approach dating as a whole, H-O-L-E, like, "I got holes in my life,

459
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 and I'm looking for you to plug and you to fill them."

460
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Because they won't be able to.

461
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 This woman tried and tried and tried and tried.

462
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 She had five marriages.

463
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Some of us are like, "I just want one, God. I just want one marriage."

464
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 She got five, and it didn't work.

465
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 I was on Instagram, and I did a poll yesterday and asked,

466
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 "Hey, what are some examples of being relationally thirsty?"

467
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And y'all are crazy, man.

468
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 So here's some of the examples and answers.

469
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 [Laughter]

470
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 They dress like a harlot.

471
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 They hop from one relationship to the next to the next.

472
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 They only text you and slide into your DMs at 3 a.m.

473
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 They're on every dating app imaginable.

474
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 They have the Snapchat handle in their Instagram bio.

475
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Hard pass.

476
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Man, it's probably time for everybody to just retire Snapchat.

477
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 [Applause]

478
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Wow.

479
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 You're welcome, TikTok.

480
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 They'll take anyone. They wear revealing clothes.

481
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 They continuously jump from one relationship to the next.

482
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 They're always talking about how they just wish that they were in a relationship.

483
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 It's all they ever post on Instagram about.

484
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 They're serially dating.

485
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 They lower their standards to address their loneliness.

486
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 They're grasping for attention and thirst traps.

487
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Now, those may not be the ways that you would say, "I'm dating dehydrated,"

488
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 but I would ask you the question, to be honest with yourself,

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 like, "Are you dating from a healthy, strong relationship in Christ?"

490
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And some of you are. Some of you should date.

491
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And you're in a great place with Christ.

492
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And you're single. And I'm so proud of you.

493
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 And keep going.

494
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 But some of you, you're dating dehydrated.

495
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And that person can't quench your thirst.

496
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You're asking them to do what only Jesus can, like salt water.

497
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 There's no amount of salt water that can quench your thirst.

498
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And if I approach salt water and want it to quench my thirst,

499
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I'm asking it to do something it cannot do.

500
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And you dating someone, expecting them to fill the hole that only Jesus can,

501
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 is asking them to do something they cannot do.

502
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And I have seen this creep in, even in Christian circles,

503
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 where people, they don't even fully realize that they're looking for this person

504
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 to fill a hole, and then they get married, and they don't fill that hole,

505
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 and they go, "Maybe I married the wrong person."

506
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 In fact, almost every affair that I've ever been a part of,

507
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 counseled, shepherded, cared for people that are walking through,

508
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 happens the exact same way.

509
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 In fact, an affair happens by somebody in this room, and I hope it never does.

510
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 But if it does, let me just tell you the offense.

511
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 It happens almost the exact same way every time.

512
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 You ready?

513
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 A couple gets married. They're in love.

514
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Things are going well. They took the vows.

515
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 They're together.

516
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Bring in some little kids along the way.

517
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 They're journeying through life. Things are hard.

518
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Bodies are changing. Job's hard.

519
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 All of a sudden, they don't have as much time to prioritize just the two of them.

520
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 He's over here at work all day long, eight hours a day.

521
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And you know what happens at work?

522
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 He's spending a lot of time around people and some coworkers,

523
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 some of the opposite sex, and he's thriving.

524
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 He's shining. He's got his best.

525
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 He's had a cup of coffee. He's sharp. He's ready.

526
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Unlike at night where he goes home, and he's changing diapers,

527
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 and he's going through all those challenges at work,

528
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 he's around people that are seeing him thrive

529
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 or seeing him use his gifts and seeing him what he's good at creating,

530
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 designing, making.

531
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And some of the opposite sex begins to connect with him and go,

532
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 "Man, you're so great at that."

533
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And it starts with an emotional connection.

534
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And while that's happening,

535
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 and the flirting is happening back and forth,

536
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 all of a sudden, they begin to spend more time together one-on-one.

537
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And maybe it's at lunch, and it's not a big deal.

538
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And all the while, just at home, things are challenging,

539
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 and life is hard, and it's stressful, and schedules are busy.

540
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 But at work, it's like, "Man, we've got wide-open spaces,

541
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 and she appreciates me. She knows my gifts."

542
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And you begin to confide in one another.

543
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 I mean, I've seen it happen more times than I could count.

544
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 And eventually, a physical line is crossed.

545
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 And you know what the mindset of this person

546
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 who's crossing that boundary the whole time is?

547
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 "I think I married the wrong person."

548
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 The majority of affairs happen at work.

549
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And they don't happen because people are going like,

550
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 "You know what? I'm just going to ruin everything in my life today."

551
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 They happen because they go,

552
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 "Oh, I think I married the wrong person,

553
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 and I don't want to be unhappy."

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And they're delusional. They're dehydrated.

555
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 They think, "If I could just get with the right person,

556
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 everything would be fine.

557
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And I must have married the wrong one."

558
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 You have never married--

559
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 no one in history has ever married the wrong person

560
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 because they're who you're married to.

561
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But if you chase and you operate looking for none to fill,

562
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 that's the storyline of how it always happens.

563
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 So you want to be someone who dates complete in Christ

564
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 and only dates people who are complete in Christ.

565
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And finally, the last one.

566
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Dating--when you are dating damaged--

567
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 now, I want to be really careful and be very specific,

568
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 because I know already people feel like damaged goods

569
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 in this talk and just in general.

570
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 By damaged, all of us in life experience hurts, trauma,

571
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 abuse to varying degrees,

572
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 but painful moments in our story.

573
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 The absence of a father or the abandonment of a parent

574
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 or something that hurts inside of your life,

575
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 and you have the responsibility and I have the responsibility.

576
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 It wasn't your fault that that happened,

577
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 but it is now your responsibility to heal from it

578
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 and not date from a damaged place.

579
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 But I've got the decision and you have got the decision

580
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 and the responsibility to decide,

581
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 "I'm going to heal from the hurt and the harm

582
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 that happened to me."

583
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Because if you don't heal from hurts, from cuts,

584
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 from things that will happen to you,

585
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 you are going to bleed out on people

586
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 who never hurt you and never cut you.

587
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 We say that again.

588
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 If you don't heal from what happened to you,

589
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 you are going to bleed out in life

590
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 on people, relationships, spouses, dating,

591
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 on people who never cut you.

592
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 But you can decide, "Man, I'm going to heal."

593
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 How do you heal from past trauma and past abuse?

594
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 We did an entire series called "Anti-Suppressants"

595
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 on working through this stuff.

596
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 But one of the things you've got to decide is,

597
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 "I'm going to forgive.

598
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 I'm going to choose to forgive people that have hurt me.

599
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 I'm not going to carry this anymore.

600
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 I'm not going to let this person

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 have any more control in my life.

602
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 I'm going to forgive them."

603
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 And again, I'd encourage you to go listen to that message

604
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 on releasing that debt and entrusting that to God,

605
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 "Anti-Suppressants" from earlier this summer.

606
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 But I'm going to choose to forgive them.

607
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Colossians chapter 3 says,

608
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 "We are to forgive one another if you have any grievance,

609
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 just like God in Christ forgave you."

610
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Anytime I'm doing a wedding of two individuals,

611
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 I ask a series of questions and meeting with them

612
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 and just getting to know them

613
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 and spend time with them before we do the wedding.

614
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And I ask this question every time,

615
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 "Is there anyone in your life you have not forgiven?"

616
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And they'll think and they'll go through,

617
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 and sometimes it's, "No, not that I can think of."

618
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 And other times it's, "My dad, my sister,

619
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 my brother, grandparent."

620
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 And I, as tenderly as I can say,

621
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 "I cannot do your wedding until you forgive them."

622
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 And that's not to be harsh or to be hurtful.

623
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 It's 'cause Jesus commands us to in Scripture.

624
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 And if I'm going to stand there and say,

625
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 "By the authority vested in me,

626
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 according to God Almighty,"

627
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 pronounce you man and wife,

628
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 I can't with integrity say,

629
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 "I am joining two people together,"

630
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 and one of them is saying,

631
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 "I carry around hurts and resentment and bitterness."

632
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Because you two coming together in marriage,

633
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 you've already shown that, "Hey, when I get hurt,

634
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 I'm going to pick this up and I'm going to carry it

635
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 and I'm going to hold onto it."

636
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 There's a level of which, "Man, if you hurt me,

637
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 I'm carrying this with me."

638
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 What happens in marriage is you have

639
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 the most intimate, deep relationship that possibly exists.

640
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And the greater the depth of intimacy,

641
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 the greater the depth and potential for pain.

642
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 And you're going to have these two people come together,

643
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 and one of them has already said,

644
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 "When I get hurt, I hold onto resentment."

645
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 So inside of that marriage, what are they going to do?

646
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 When they get hurt, they're going to hold onto that resentment.

647
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 And marriage is two people choosing to forgive one another

648
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 after deeply hurting one another,

649
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 unintentionally or intentionally.

650
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Billy Graham was asked, "What makes a good marriage?"

651
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 And he said, "Two great forgivers."

652
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 Is there anyone that you need to forgive?

653
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Maybe one of the greatest gifts you can give your spouse

654
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 is saying, "Man, I have worked through and healed

655
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 a lot of painful things, and it may take time,

656
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 but I can say, 'Man, I've forgiven

657
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 all that have harmed and hurt me.'"

658
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Another way to begin to heal is to deal with toxic habits,

659
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 that eating disorder.

660
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 If there's something you need to confess

661
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 to your community group, a pornography addiction,

662
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 that is feeding and fueling lies as it relates to sexuality,

663
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 a spending problem, that you've got multiple credit cards

664
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 in multiple different directions,

665
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 and you've got a lease on a Range Rover outside,

666
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 and you're way over the top in terms of debt.

667
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 There's a gambling problem.

668
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Maybe you're coping with just alcohol,

669
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 weed, nicotine, video games.

670
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 That you would deal with those toxic habits now,

671
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 because marriage, like I said, it doesn't make those go away.

672
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 It magnifies them.

673
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 You're putting pressure on it.

674
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Whatever you're carrying, you can give the gift to your spouse

675
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 of saying, "I'm going to choose in this season to work on that,

676
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 work through that."

677
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 When you go on your honeymoon, you're going to bring luggage with you.

678
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 You want the luggage and baggage you bring

679
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 to be in physical luggage,

680
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 not baggage that you're still carrying.

681
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Or you want to minimize it as best that you can.

682
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 And that is a gift to your future wife or your future husband.

683
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 And then spend this season prioritizing Jesus.

684
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Maybe you need to go through REGEN, which is a recovery ministry

685
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 and dealing with different destructive hurts, habits,

686
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 and hangups on Monday nights here at 6 o'clock, 6.30.

687
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Prioritize pursuing Jesus.

688
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Paul said in 1 Corinthians 7, "Use this season right now,

689
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 if you're single, to strengthen and solidify

690
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 an undistracted devotion to the Lord."

691
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 My wife and I, we dated for a year,

692
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 and then we broke up for almost two years.

693
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And there was no plan to get back together.

694
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 We just reached a point where we weren't ready to move forward.

695
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 It just was the right time.

696
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 And it was horrible, and it was really painful.

697
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 And I didn't know what would happen.

698
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 But I decided in that season, man, I'm going to take a year,

699
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 and just pursue and prioritize the Lord.

700
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 That I'm going to grow in my knowledge of His Word.

701
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 I'm going to grow.

702
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 And I was a 20-something single in Dallas.

703
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 And the moment you decide, God, I'm just going to pursue

704
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 and prioritize you for this season,

705
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 it's like every amazing single lady in the whole world

706
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 begins to pop up all around you

707
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 after you've made that commitment.

708
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 But it was one of the greatest seasons.

709
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 I look back, and I don't know who I would be today

710
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 if I didn't have that season.

711
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 And it wasn't a result of,

712
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 the reason wasn't because of a breakup.

713
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 It didn't have to be because of a breakup.

714
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 It was just a season where I could go,

715
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 God, I just want to prioritize you

716
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 and learn more about you.

717
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 And maybe if you are any of these three things,

718
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 the gift you can give is go,

719
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 man, I'm going to prioritize preparing for marriage

720
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 by prioritizing Jesus.

721
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 The truth about marriage is it is far more important

722
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 and far more significant the preparation you have before it

723
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 than the promise you make.

724
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Let me say that again.

725
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 Marriage is going to come down to preparation

726
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 and a promise, not a promise.

727
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 It's not the strength of your promise

728
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 that is going to make it work.

729
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 In other words, if this week, Dallas Cowboys,

730
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 Coach McCarthy, whatever his name is,

731
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 comes out and he's like, hey,

732
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 I promise we are going to win the Super Bowl.

733
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 I am committed and I promise as hard as I can,

734
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 we're going to win the Super Bowl.

735
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 You would roll your eyes and you go,

736
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 man, you can promise all day,

737
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 but if you're not preparing,

738
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 you're not going to win the games.

739
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Because we know that when it comes to athletics and sports,

740
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 it's not about how hard you promise,

741
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 it's about how well you prepare.

742
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 And the same is true in marriage.

743
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 You can together be like, hey, boo, man,

744
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 we're going to make it, no, this is going to be great,

745
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 I'm really, really promise.

746
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 But if you don't prepare, it comes down to preparation,

747
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 not the strength of your promise,

748
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 but how well you have prepared.

749
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 In conclusion, these are three signs to exit in dating.

750
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 You're dating delusionally,

751
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 and you need to shift and embrace God's design.

752
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 You're dating dehydrated,

753
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 and you need to shift and embrace

754
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 that Christ alone can satisfy.

755
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 You're dating damaged,

756
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 and that doesn't change your value,

757
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 and you're not damaged goods or thrown out to the curb,

758
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 but you got to heal.

759
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 And you're going to choose,

760
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 I'm going to prioritize healing and pursuing Jesus.

761
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 I was in Mobile, Alabama,

762
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 and I was speaking about a month ago at an event,

763
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 and I landed and I got off the plane,

764
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 and I realized I didn't have a belt,

765
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 or I forgot my belt,

766
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 and so I Googled and looked what stores were available nearby

767
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 and by the hotel,

768
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 and it was a Marshall's.

769
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 And I drove over and went inside of the Marshall's,

770
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 and if you've been into Marshall's,

771
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 it's kind of like Ross or just one of these stores

772
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 where you go in and everything's on sale.

773
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 I don't know that they've ever had an item

774
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 that is not on sale go into Marshall's before.

775
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 So I go over there, and I'm looking at all these belts,

776
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 and they're like, "This belt was $119,

777
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 but now we'll sell it for a nickel."

778
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 And so everything is just like so marked down,

779
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 and I literally bought the belt that I'm wearing right now,

780
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 and it was $49.99 for $7.99.

781
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 It's just like, man, who -- what is the business model,

782
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 and how are they making any sort of revenue on this,

783
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 and why are they selling these products so discounted?

784
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 Maybe they don't think they're as valuable,

785
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 or they are valuable.

786
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 And then you contrast that with other stores.

787
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 Stores you go into, and they never have a sale.

788
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 I mean, I'm talking like high-end stores,

789
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 or even Apple, that you go in, and you're like,

790
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 "Look, hey, is the iPhone, is there going to be like a sale

791
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 coming out, like 20% off?"

792
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 And they're like, "No."

793
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 You go into Louis Vuitton, and they go,

794
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 "I'm sorry, we don't do sales.

795
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 We don't do coupons.

796
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 We know the value of our product,

797
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 and we're not going to sell it short.

798
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 We're not going to discount it and undercut its value."

799
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 The difference in those two scenarios is one says,

800
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 "Man, I know its value, and I won't settle for anything less."

801
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 The other one says, "Its value is really not that big.

802
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
 I'll take whatever we can get."

803
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 I want to leave you with this.

804
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 This woman had the most broken relational history

805
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 of anyone in the New Testament.

806
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 The Son of God shows up on the planet,

807
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 and one of the first interactions that he has

808
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 is him prioritizing, "I have got to go to Samaria."

809
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 Not he happened to walk through, and they were going along,

810
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 and he said, "No, no, guys, hey, today we're all getting up.

811
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 We are going to Samaria because there is a woman

812
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 who I have an appointment with, who I am pursuing,

813
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 who I want to know, despite all the brokenness,

814
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 all the messed up stuff, she needs to know her worth.

815
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 And I will expose and explain that I am the Son of God,

816
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 the Savior of the world, the Messiah,

817
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 the one who paid for all of humanity's sins,

818
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 the one that she has been waiting for,

819
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 because I'm not done with her.

820
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 And she needs to know her value, despite all the brokenness."

821
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 It doesn't change how I feel about her.

822
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 He had to go to Samaria.

823
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 And what you need to hear is God,

824
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 no matter your past, has not changed how He feels about you.

825
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 And he says, "You want to know your worth?

826
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
 You need to stop discounting yourself

827
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 and giving yourself out and allowing other guys,

828
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 and they don't meet all the standards that God says,

829
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
 but I just am afraid of being lonely,

830
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
 and real guys don't exist like they talk about at the porch,

831
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 or real girls don't exist like that.

832
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 You don't sell yourself short because you know your value.

833
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 Your value is so great that God Himself

834
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
 would die on a cross for your sin, for your life.

835
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 That's how valuable you are.

836
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 And when you come to dating, you think about love.

837
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 You don't sell yourself short.

838
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
 Discount your life. Discount your future.

839
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 Discount your sexuality, your marriage, your love,

840
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 because you know your value.

841
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 Just like this woman, Jesus said,

842
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 "I know everything about you.

843
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
 I still love you.

844
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
 I'm still here to die for you.

845
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
 It doesn't change how I feel.

846
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
 I want you to experience healing in your love life.

847
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 It doesn't make me move away, though.

848
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 I want you to know your value."

849
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
 And I hope tonight,

850
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
 if you've never trusted in Christ and received Him as your Savior,

851
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 the payment for your sin, He's so in love with you.

852
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 And that relationship above any other matters most.

853
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
 You want to know your value?

854
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Your value, according to God,

855
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
 was the exchange of His own life

856
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
 so He could have a relationship with you.

857
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
 You don't sell yourself short and settle for a discount.

858
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 You know who you are.

859
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 And now date and live in light of that.

860
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
 Let me pray.

861
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 Father, I pray for everyone in this room

862
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
 who is in a dating relationship

863
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 that you would breathe clarity and life

864
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 into that relationship if you want it to continue,

865
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 if it would honor you to continue.

866
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 And if it doesn't, and if it isn't, and wouldn't,

867
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 we pray that you would break it up.

868
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 And we ask for your help in our hearts

869
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 as we journey through that.

870
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 I pray for every single person here

871
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
 that if they were honest, they would say, "I'm not ready."

872
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 And I need to spend some time prioritizing you

873
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
 that that would happen.

874
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 I thank you for the hundreds, if not thousands,

875
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 of godly singles who love you and model daily.

876
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 You are enough, you're sufficient,

877
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 you're the one I was made for.

878
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
 And God, we trust you with marriage

879
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
 and we ask that you would provide,

880
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 if that is in your will, a spouse, in your time,

881
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
 and help us to trust you with that.

882
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 And I pray that this whole series

883
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 wouldn't just sharpen best practices on dating,

884
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
 but deepen our relationship with you,

885
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
 the one we were made for.

886
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 We love you. Amen.

887
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:39,000
