[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:17.760]   Well, welcome to The Porch.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.440]   Wherever you are tuning in tonight from around the country
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.000]   or even the world, welcome.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   And if you find yourself in Houston tuning in,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.720]   then I want to encourage you to check out The Porch Live
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.240]   Houston.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.720]   Friends down there are starting tonight for the first time
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.480]   live since the quarantine.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.440]   And if you're in this room, welcome, friends.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.600]   Appreciate y'all being here.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200]   My name is Josiah, and I have the privilege of serving here
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.520]   on staff at The Porch.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.200]   Well, I thought I'd start out with just sharing a quick story.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.040]   I want to take you back to sixth grade.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.720]   Yes, we're going back to sixth grade.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.720]   So go back there with me for just a minute.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.000]   If you're anything like me, it was baggy Tommy Hilfiger
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.880]   shirts, it was baggy jeans, and it was the ball chain necklace.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.560]   Like, I get it.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.920]   I know I just dated myself.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.760]   I did it.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.240]   All good, though.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.280]   But here's what I know.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.780]   Here's what I know about sixth grade.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.960]   I remember walking into science class for the first time,
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.260]   and the science teacher gave me one of these.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.920]   He gave me a Styrofoam cup, and he gave me some soil,
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.840]   and he gave me a bean.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.760]   Y'all remember this?
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.240]   I know, Ramsey, you remember this, don't you?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.120]   Yeah, so we get this Styrofoam cup, we get some soil,
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.440]   and then we get a bean.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.880]   And before too long, we see a little green shoot sprout up.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880]   And I remember the science teacher specifically saying,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.080]   you're going to need three things in order for this bean
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   to grow.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.560]   You're going to need sun, you're going to need water,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.720]   and you're going to need soil.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.280]   And some of you are like, man, you've
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.640]   been growing that in your garage?
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.960]   No, no, no, that's not what this is about, I promise you.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.320]   Maybe BC, before Christ's days, but listen, stay with me.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.120]   Listen, this is why I start there tonight.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.880]   Because just like science class, they told us,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.800]   hey, you're going to need these things to grow, sun, water,
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.680]   and soil to grow this bean.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.040]   There are things in our faith that we need to grow.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.600]   There are things that God is asking us to have,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.380]   and really saying, hey, if you don't have these things,
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.760]   then you will not grow.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000]   And so stay with me for a second.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.560]   Imagine your prayer life.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.240]   Imagine your prayer life is the sun, okay?
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.160]   So the sun equals your prayer life.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.760]   Let's say the Bible, the Bible equals,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.840]   man, that equals the water, okay?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.520]   Let's say the Bible equals the water.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.440]   That's your intake of God's word.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.480]   And then let's say the soil represents your community.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.800]   And when I say community,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.960]   I'm talking about your friend groups.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.760]   I'm talking about those people that you hang out with.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.540]   And this is what I know.
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.920]   You can have an amazing prayer life.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.200]   You can get into God's word every single day.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.100]   You can memorize scripture.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.860]   But if your soil, which is your community,
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.560]   your friend group, if your soil is toxic,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.960]   then you will not grow.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.280]   Like bottom line, it will not happen.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.200]   We've never, we will never be the best version of ourself.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.280]   So if we wanna grow,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   then we will have to have the right community.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.120]   And if you don't wanna grow, said no one ever,
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.420]   like you, then you won't pursue these things.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.320]   Tonight, I wanna talk to you about community.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.480]   Where are you planted?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.940]   Psalm 92, 13 says,
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.760]   "Planted in the house of God, you will flourish."
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.500]   You will flourish.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.320]   And for some of us, man,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.140]   it's been a long hard season of this coronavirus
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.140]   because like we've been quarantined.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.420]   But my fear tonight is that some of you
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.160]   are gonna hear a message like this,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.380]   and you're gonna sorta connect with God,
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.260]   and you're gonna sorta connect with God's people,
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.420]   but you're gonna walk away
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.620]   and you're just not gonna go all in.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.760]   And here's what's at stake.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.800]   The Bible says that when you don't go all in with community,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.800]   then in other words, like you're hushing the voice of God,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   because one of God's primary means of communicating
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   and provisions in our life as Christians is community.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.120]   It's getting with other trusted friends who follow Jesus.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.360]   We call that community here at the porch in Watermark.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.080]   It's a core value that we embody here.
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.580]   It's this idea that we were made for relationships.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.260]   If you're taking notes, and I hope you are,
[00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.720]   point number one, we were made for relationships.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.160]   Like we were created for relationships.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   Like you see this rhythm in Genesis 1
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.200]   where God is creating and he says it's good,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.840]   and he creates and he says it's good,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   and he creates and he says it's good.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   And he does this six times.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.600]   And then on the seventh time, he rests.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.720]   And so you have this paradise, a place of perfection.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.140]   Sin hasn't even entered the world yet.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.080]   It's just Adam and God, and God is giving Adam authority
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.360]   among all the animals and in the entire creation.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.080]   And so there should be this amazing connection
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.620]   and a perfect situation with Adam and God,
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.400]   but then something happens.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.600]   There's an interruption that breaks into the creation story.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.040]   God says there is something there that is not good.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.920]   Like what could be wrong with perfection after God created?
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.740]   That's a question.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.960]   Can there be something not good in a perfect place?
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.640]   Let's check out Genesis 2.18.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.120]   This is what it says.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.600]   The Lord God said it is not good for the man to be alone.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.120]   Being alone was the very first thing that God said
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.880]   that hey, it wasn't good.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.480]   And I know this is kind of fascinating to me
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.040]   because nothing is fallen yet.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.640]   Everything is still in perfection.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.000]   And so God is saying in this moment that,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.680]   hey, it's not good for you to be alone, Adam.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.360]   And he's telling us tonight, years later,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.160]   that it's not good for us to be alone.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.600]   Humans are created to live in relationship with each other.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.440]   Think of it like solitary confinement.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.600]   Solitary confinement is what they do in prison.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.480]   I mean, I looked it up and it's people in prison.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.920]   They dread this punishment of solitary confinement.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.080]   Like one person said,
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.760]   keeping prisoners totally isolated from a living world
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.000]   comes dangerously close to the penal tomb.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.800]   Being locked up is a place
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.360]   where you have zero human interaction.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.700]   And we know that one of the worst things that can happen
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.440]   is you cut humans off from the rest of the world.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.400]   Psychologically, it literally destroys them.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.240]   This is what this person is saying.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.960]   In other words, it's a slow death for prisoners.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.540]   And listen, you might not be in a prison
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.000]   of solitary confinement,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.200]   but you could be in a prison to anxiety.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.640]   Like you could be in a prison tonight to depression.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:55.760]   You could be in a prison tonight of loneliness
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.680]   because you're disconnected from God's people.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.080]   And so there's an amazing truth
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.760]   for us to latch onto tonight.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.440]   And this truth is even if it was just us and God alone
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.480]   in perfection, he would say that's not good.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.140]   Because you know, I hear people tell me all the time,
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.500]   man, I'm good Josiah.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.660]   I don't need the church.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.200]   I don't need other brothers or sisters in my life
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.040]   to run with.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.860]   I'm good, man.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.980]   It's just me and God.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.320]   Like he knows me, I know him and we're tight.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.080]   And I'm sorry to break it to you,
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.700]   but the Bible contradicts that type of thinking.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.960]   I mean, I thought that way for so long in my own life,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.140]   but in Proverbs 18, one, it says this,
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.940]   "Whoever isolates himself."
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:43.740]   In other words, cuts himself off, seeks his own desire.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.500]   He breaks out against all sound judgment.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.040]   I mean, he will not have the wisdom
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.740]   that God wants him to have.
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.580]   In case you missed it earlier, Psalm 92, 13,
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.740]   "Those who are planted in the house of the Lord
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.860]   self-growth, self-flourish."
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.020]   Planted in the house of God, you will flourish.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.220]   Doing life together, getting connected with people
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.220]   that don't look like you, maybe even act like you,
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.060]   smell like you, dress like you,
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.740]   have the same desires as you.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.100]   God is saying that's a good thing.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.940]   Listen, my wife and I, Kathy, like we could be,
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.000]   I mean, we couldn't be any different.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.500]   I mean, she's creative, she's a designer.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.860]   She's just kind of has this, you know,
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.940]   I call them piles of goodness all over the house.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.020]   She's messy, but she's creative.
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.060]   I'm type A to the max, right?
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.740]   I mean, seriously, that's it.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.400]   We're totally different,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.700]   but God has used that to compliment us
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.700]   and to grow us and to make really us
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.800]   into the people that he wants us to be.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.620]   Like it's easy for us to believe this lie
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.860]   that my faith is just between me and God
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.860]   and I don't really need anyone else.
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.900]   God and I are cool.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.540]   I don't need to worry about the rest of you guys.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.740]   I'm just gonna do my thing.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.100]   And although that sounds really good,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.420]   it's just not truthful.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.580]   It's just not healthy, as God would say.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.160]   You know why Corona has been so hard for some of us?
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.560]   It's because it's put us in a quarantine state
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.080]   where we really haven't been able to interact with people.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.320]   And so God is saying,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.960]   "Hey, you were never meant to be isolated.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.160]   You were made for relationships."
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.760]   And eventually, no matter where you live,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.240]   they're gonna open everything up.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   And they're gonna say,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.360]   "Hey, you don't need to quarantine yourself anymore."
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.720]   And tonight the God of the universe is saying,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.480]   "Hey, you don't need to quarantine.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.880]   You can come out of hiding.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.480]   You can interact with people.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.760]   Still be safe.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.600]   Jump on Zoom.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.740]   We'll talk about that here in a minute,
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.600]   but you can do things that causes you to lean
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.340]   into other trusted men and women who love Jesus
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.480]   and are following Him."
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.960]   And so some of you are like,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.320]   "Man, I got relationships, Josiah.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.160]   I got it.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.160]   I mean, seriously, you don't need to tell me that.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.160]   I know that I was created, I was made for relationships,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.600]   but this is what I wanna ask you.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.240]   Are they the right people?
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.680]   Are they the people following Jesus?"
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.240]   So when I say stop quarantining from people,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.080]   this should also, for some of us, it should say,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.560]   "Hey, some of us need to start quarantining
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.800]   from the wrong people."
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.640]   Why?
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.460]   Because this is what I know,
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.960]   because you catch the symptoms of those you run with.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.320]   Like the people that you run with,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.000]   the people that I run with,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.120]   like I'm gonna catch the symptoms.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.240]   I'm gonna catch their sicknesses.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.640]   Like we know this to be true, like corona season.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.080]   I don't know how many times I've done this.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.460]   Like, "You've been traveling?
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.680]   Oh man, you probably got corona.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.520]   I'm out.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.400]   Hey, we need to separate ourselves from each other."
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.120]   And so we do this,
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.760]   even in the season that we find ourself in.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.840]   And some of us, quite frankly,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.520]   we need to do this with some of the people in our life
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.800]   that are dragging us down,
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.640]   because you're gonna catch the symptoms
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.440]   and the sicknesses of the people that you run with.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.840]   This is true physically.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.240]   And what God's saying tonight, this is true spiritually.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.360]   The Bible says it like this.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.940]   2 Corinthians 6, 14.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.620]   "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.040]   For what does righteousness and wickedness have in common?
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.760]   They contradict each other.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.700]   They're on totally opposite ends of the spectrum.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.800]   And so don't be yoked.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.420]   Don't put yourself in a position where, man,
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.280]   your best friends are people that aren't like-minded.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.640]   It's not saying, "Hey, you can't have friends
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.840]   that don't think like you and believe like you."
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.680]   But they're saying,
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.880]   "Hey, when it comes to your closest boys
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.680]   or your closest ladies, women,
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.200]   like those should be people
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.600]   that are running hard after Jesus."
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.640]   I mean, it shouldn't be this idea where,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.800]   "Hey, we're just gonna separate ourself
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.640]   and we're just gonna have our little holy huddles
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.480]   and Christian cliques.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.240]   We're never gonna try to affect the rest of the world."
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.720]   No, that would be crazy.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.320]   No, we've been called to be the light of the world.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.280]   But when those people start affecting us
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.000]   and bringing us down, that's when it's like,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.700]   "Hey, man, we gotta draw the line
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.960]   and we gotta have people around us that we can trust
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.640]   that are gonna point us back to Him."
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.460]   Goes on and says,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.720]   "Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?"
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.640]   Point number two, if you're taking notes,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.720]   we were made to be fully known.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.080]   We were made to be fully known.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.680]   Most people who fight anxiety, shame, and guilt
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.600]   do so on their own when we were never supposed to do so.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.280]   Like God meant for us never to hide.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.240]   You were made to be fully known.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.460]   God is saying tonight, "Hey, I've made you to be known."
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.260]   Our generation who is literally
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.080]   one of the most connected generations ever in human history
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.980]   because of the smartphone and social media,
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.900]   social scientists are saying that,
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.100]   "Man, even though we're connected, we're the most lonely.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.380]   We're the loneliest
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.740]   and the most depressed generation statistically."
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.920]   And this is even truer right now during the Corona season.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.860]   Like these, I mean, these stats are just skyrocketing.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.980]   And this is why we also tend to make really poor decisions
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.560]   when we make these decisions in isolation.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.580]   If nobody truly knows you,
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.780]   knows how you're feeling, what you're facing,
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.260]   what's going on in your life,
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.340]   then God's saying, "Hey, that's truly not good."
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.180]   God's also saying,
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.620]   "Hey, it's not good to be alone in the crowd."
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.180]   Like some of you tonight, you're like, "Man, I'm not alone.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.820]   Man, I do the CrossFit thing.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.140]   I do SoulCycle.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.800]   I do bar classes.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.540]   Man, after work, I go to the restaurant.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.260]   I have a few drinks at the bar with some of my friends."
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.620]   But come on, if we were honest with ourselves,
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.100]   like they don't know much else than, you know,
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.140]   you're a Cowboys fan,
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.940]   what you bought on Amazon the night before
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.580]   and what you think about the Bachelor.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.660]   Like God is saying,
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.740]   "Hey, it's not good to be alone in the crowd."
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.620]   Some of you are like, "I get a hundred likes on Instagram
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.260]   or retweets on Twitter," or whatever the case may be.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.160]   That's not being known.
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.940]   And here's why it's not good.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.940]   This is so important.
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.240]   I believe that you'll never be fully loved
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.260]   until you're fully known.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.940]   Like you will never be fully loved until you're fully known
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.320]   because they're just loving some false version of yourself
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.200]   and of myself.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.980]   And so I kind of liken it to this quarantine mask.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.260]   Everywhere you go lately,
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.980]   it seems like someone is wearing one of these
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.240]   and when you're not wearing one,
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.520]   you just kind of feel out of place.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.560]   That's me 'cause I can't stand these things.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.240]   But I was in Costco the other day
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.520]   and it was my duty to get groceries this week.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.760]   And so I went into Costco and my wife couldn't even go in
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.560]   because we only had one of these in the car.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   And so I made my way in Costco and I can't,
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.360]   I'm having a hard time breathing in this thing.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.580]   It's just, they're just awkward.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.360]   They're uncomfortable, right?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.100]   And it's bizarre because, man,
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.580]   now you really have to wear one.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:53.580]   And so listen, this isn't really a new concept.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.000]   Like if you were to be honest with yourself
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.840]   and if I were to be honest with myself tonight,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   like physically, like this is a new concept.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.200]   But we've been wearing masks for a long time.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.600]   Like some of us, like we wear masks,
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.840]   because this mask represents hiding.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.640]   Like we wear a mask when we sin
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.140]   and we try to hide ourself from letting people see that.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.860]   Or, I mean, we just wanna put our best foot forward
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.580]   or hey, we try to act like we have it all together.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.340]   So we wear this mask, we hide from people out of fear
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.260]   of, hey, what are they gonna think of us if I share this
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.120]   or if they know this part about me?
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.300]   And so you see, I got pretty good.
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.980]   I mean, from my life, I got pretty good at wearing a mask.
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.700]   You know, it was invisible of course,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.780]   but it was a mask nonetheless.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.660]   I was, remember the first time I looked at porn,
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.700]   this idea, man, I love this.
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.760]   It was amazing.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.060]   It sparked all this emotion
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.740]   I never felt before in these feelings.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.260]   But I knew deep down something was wrong,
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.540]   something was broken.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.660]   And so I just put on this mask of like,
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.500]   man, I'm just gonna keep that thing suppressed.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.620]   I'm not really gonna let anyone know
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.060]   that I'm becoming an addict.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.380]   Or the cross necklace.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.540]   I remember wearing a cross necklace
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.300]   when I played baseball games and it was good luck charm.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.620]   I wanted people to think that I was spiritual
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.380]   or going out to the parties and getting drunk,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.500]   doing that lifestyle.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.580]   I wanted, I mean, I had my cross necklace outs
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.060]   for everyone to see 'cause I wanted them to see
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.140]   that I was a pretty good person.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.220]   And so that was just a form of a mask
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.700]   or being single 'til I was 31 years old.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.220]   I wanted to wear the mask, say, hey man, I don't need that.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.620]   I don't need a woman.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.180]   But deep down inside, I'm like, man, I wanna be married.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.900]   So I just kind of put the mask on of, man, I'm good.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.820]   See, we wear masks to mask the pain
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.140]   and the hardship that we're facing.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.180]   But you know who I'm not wearing a mask around?
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:01.820]   My community.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.540]   These are men that I've grown to love
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.940]   because I know them and they know me.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.460]   No matter where I've been in thought, word, and action,
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.900]   like I can come to them and I can share where I've been
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.140]   in those areas of my life.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   And here's what I know,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.040]   they're gonna love me unconditionally.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.180]   They're not just gonna affirm
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.900]   or condone the things that I'm doing,
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.540]   but they're gonna point me to Christ
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.540]   and they're gonna point me to his truth
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.180]   and they're gonna hold me accountable.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.860]   Just last night, I had a disagreement with my wife, Kathy,
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.540]   and it was getting late and I knew I needed to study.
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.740]   And we just kind of shelved it and said,
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.860]   hey, let's talk about it in the morning.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.340]   And I went downstairs and started studying
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.560]   and the attack came.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.420]   The attack to get on Instagram
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.980]   and start looking at things,
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.300]   the temptation came for me to look at things
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.820]   that I knew I shouldn't have looked at.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.260]   And in that moment, I was, man, I was getting,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.300]   I mean, I was getting worked up over the fact that,
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.580]   hey, this is a part of my past,
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.780]   this is a part of my story, I want it,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.660]   there's still a part of my heart that loves porn,
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.500]   I'm just trying to be honest tonight.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.780]   But in that moment, I reached out.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.260]   I reached out because I knew Satan wanted nothing more
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.260]   than to get me to fall before I taught this message.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.500]   And by God's grace, I didn't look at anything,
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.260]   but I was tempted, so I reached out to four men in my life
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.980]   that God has placed in my life since I moved here
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.220]   about 10 months ago.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.580]   And I just said, hey, look, I'm in the middle of studying
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.860]   and I'm tempted, my wife and I just had a disagreement
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.700]   and listen, I am tempted to look at things
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.660]   I know I shouldn't.
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.820]   And they were probably sleeping,
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.780]   but you know what that did in that moment?
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.700]   It lessened, it weakened that temptation
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.300]   because I knew the very next day,
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.180]   they were gonna ask me and they did,
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.940]   hey, did you win the battle?
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.700]   Did you look at porn?
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.340]   Did you reconcile with your wife?
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:18.180]   And they did, they asked me and by God's grace, I did, I won.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.700]   But don't be fooled, I wanna wear a mask all the time.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.620]   Like I wanna cover up the brokenness in my life.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.260]   Like, do you think I wanted to reach out to them
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.220]   and let them know that I was struggling last night?
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.540]   Absolutely not.
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.660]   Like I want them to see my best foot forward.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.700]   Like I want them to see that Josiah is strong.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.020]   I want them to see that, hey, there's no struggles,
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.780]   but when I'm feeling tempted to look at something
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.940]   I know I shouldn't look at,
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.060]   like I need to confess that on a thought level,
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.020]   not wait till I get to the action.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.500]   And I remember thinking last night,
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.560]   God, thank you for providing a way out.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.340]   Thank you for weakening this part of me.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.380]   Thank you that, hey, even though I wanna be seen
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.580]   and I wanna be in the best light,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.060]   thank you that like I can by faith remove the mask
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.460]   and trust that when they see the real me,
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.620]   I won't get infected with rejection.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.220]   I won't get infected with shame and guilt and condemnation.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.040]   Why?
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.940]   Because you nailed Jesus to the cross for those things.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:22.220]   And Romans 8, one says,
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.980]   "There is therefore now no condemnation
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.340]   "for those that are in Christ Jesus."
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.100]   And so listen, even if they wanted to shame me,
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.580]   I know that there's no shame in that
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.900]   because you went to the cross
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.220]   and all of my sin was poured out on him at the cross.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.160]   And so this is why I can be real.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.860]   This is why I can be,
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.500]   I can stand boldly before you and even share this.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.100]   Like there's a part of my heart, it's like,
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.300]   man, what are people gonna think of me?
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.700]   I don't care.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.460]   It's because Christ paid for that.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.060]   And he set me free from that rejection
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   and that condemnation and that shame.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.120]   And he wants to do that in your life too.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.060]   It's time to take off the mask tonight.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.720]   What mask are you wearing?
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.220]   What mask are you wearing
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.280]   that you're tempted even to put on?
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.780]   Tonight it's time to take off the mask.
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.420]   Psalm 32, three.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.300]   The Psalmist says, "When I kept silent,
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.680]   "my bones wasted away.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.520]   "Through my groanings all day long."
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.540]   The Psalmist is saying, "Hey, when you suppress sin,
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.360]   "your bones are gonna waste away.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.780]   "Like you're gonna get sick.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.620]   "Like when you don't bring that to the light,
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.020]   "when you don't share that,
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.020]   "share that thing that you thought you'd never tell anyone."
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.100]   Like some of you right now, you're listening to this like,
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.500]   "Oh no, I couldn't do that.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.180]   "Like I promised myself
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.840]   "that I'm taking that thing to the grave
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.700]   "and I'm not doing, I'm not going there, Josiah.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.220]   "Absolutely not."
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.520]   And God is saying, "Hey, if you go there,
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.860]   "there's healing, there's forgiveness.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.120]   "I want to make you whole."
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.180]   I believe this with all my heart
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.380]   that the power of sin is in secrecy.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.360]   In other words, like when we decide to suppress sin
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.160]   and we decide, "Hey, we're not gonna tell anybody
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.380]   "those things that we thought we were gonna take
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.220]   "to the grave."
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.000]   But when we bring those things to light,
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.480]   it loosens its power and it weakens.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.200]   This is why in James 5:16, he says,
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.820]   "Therefore confess your sins to each other
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.800]   "and pray for each other so that you may be healed."
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.640]   And then it goes on and says,
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.060]   "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.800]   It's not saying just confess that to anybody.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.760]   It's saying to confess that to a righteous person,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.600]   someone that loves Jesus,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.420]   someone that's in right standing with God,
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.060]   someone that's pursuing Him.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.880]   See, I believe with all my heart that the secret to life
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.480]   is to live a life without secrets.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.820]   Where we begin to see that our whole life is exposed
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.440]   before God and someone that we can trust.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   Am I saying, "Hey, go share this with 10 people?"
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.280]   No.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.760]   Real practical, let's just bring it down a level.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.880]   Do you know someone that you could trust
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.900]   that follows Jesus?
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.200]   That I encourage you tonight to pick up the phone
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.160]   before you go to bed and just say,
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.320]   "Hey, how are you doing?"
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.640]   And then tell them about how you're doing
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.140]   and say, "Hey, listen, I don't know why I called you,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.900]   "but I know God is telling me to call you.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.740]   "And I just got to share with you, I'm struggling.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.180]   "Can you pray for me?"
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.120]   And maybe you can't be giving explicit details,
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.920]   but maybe you just said, "Hey, I'm struggling.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.500]   "I looked at something that I shouldn't have."
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.720]   Or, "Hey, I've been overeating or I've been under eating
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.600]   "because life seems out of control.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.240]   "And this is one area of my life that I can control."
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.200]   Maybe you would pick up the phone
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.980]   and you would just say something like,
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.880]   "Hey, I've been trading naked pictures with people
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.960]   "because I've been just craving for affirmation."
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.220]   There, I said it.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.960]   Will you help me?
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.720]   Listen, if you're waiting for someone to come to you
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.680]   and ask you how you're doing
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.620]   or ask you what you've been struggling with,
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.400]   listen, you're probably gonna be waiting
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.700]   longer than you want.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.720]   Like confession isn't gonna find you.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.680]   You have to find it.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.980]   You have to run to confession.
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.960]   You have to find someone that you can trust
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.920]   that will not mismanage information.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.680]   And some of you, that's your story.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.660]   But I would say, don't stop.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.620]   Hang on to Romans 8.1.
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.640]   I don't care if they miss,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.320]   I mean, I do care that they mismanage information,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.880]   but listen, at the end of the day,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.160]   you don't have to let that mismanaging of information
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.800]   define you because God says you're forgiven
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.980]   and you do not have shame anymore
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.860]   because I put that on my son, Jesus.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.180]   Listen, the best version of you and I
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.740]   stands on the other side of community.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.580]   Do you know that?
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.300]   Do you believe that tonight?
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.960]   The most healed and whole person
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.000]   that you wanna be and that I wanna be,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.060]   I believe stands on the other side of community
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.900]   where you can go to them and you can confess.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.240]   And I'm wondering tonight, do you have that?
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.080]   Do you have that?
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.400]   Have you prayed and maybe asked God to forgive you
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.300]   and he's forgiving you,
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.060]   but you're still walking around wounded
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.560]   and kind of beat up?
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.260]   And I believe it's because some of us,
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.780]   and we walk out 1 John 1, 9,
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.540]   where we confess our sin and he's faithful
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.940]   and just to forgive us of our sin
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.740]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.060]   the scripture says.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.300]   And so we're forgiven, but we're not healed
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.660]   because healing comes when we confess that one to another.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.380]   Where you have trusted friends who come alongside of you
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.000]   and help you fight against your sin.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.420]   They begin to help you come up with a game plan
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.100]   to defeat that sin that continues to beat you down.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.400]   Let me ask you, what's your plan for defeating sin?
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.280]   What is your plan for defeating sin in your life?
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.200]   Like some of us, man, we're losing the battle
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.760]   before we ever go to war
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.760]   because we walk into the battle without a plan.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.120]   And the God of the universe is saying,
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.800]   "Hey, listen, it's okay to be vulnerable.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.700]   It's okay to be transparent."
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:16.560]   2 Corinthians 12, eight, God responds to Paul and says,
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.800]   "Paul, my power is made perfect in your weakness."
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.580]   And look what Paul's response is.
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.600]   "Therefore, I'm gonna boast about my weakness
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.720]   because when I'm weak, who is strong?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.360]   He's strong."
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.680]   That's when you begin to experience the power of God
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.520]   in your life and my life.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.480]   This quarantine, it's been a completely different experience
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.940]   for those who have been in community
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.920]   versus those who have not.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.640]   But tonight, that can change.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.760]   Tonight, like right after this message,
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.760]   you can go to watermark.org/community
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.000]   and you can sign up.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.360]   If you live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.720]   you can sign up to get in community.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.600]   Maybe you're just like, "Hey, I don't have that.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.760]   I don't know what this guy's...
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.720]   I mean, I'm starting to understand
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.560]   what this guy's talking about,
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.000]   and I'm starting to believe that I need it."
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.660]   Do it.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:03.660]   Some of you tonight, you're like,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.360]   "Man, I don't live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area."
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.320]   Then hey, find a church that loves Jesus
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.800]   and preaches Jesus and wants to be about Jesus.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.160]   And if you need help, reach out.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.260]   We'd love to help you.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.600]   I can't challenge you enough to take this step,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.680]   not just because we see this rooted in God's word,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.720]   but because I've experienced this with my own life
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.360]   and continue to experience this to this day.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   Jesus got ahold of me in college and I was narcissistic.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.240]   I was selfish.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   It was all about Josiah.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.160]   But then the breaking moment happened
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:40.000]   where I finally saw my sin for what it is
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.960]   in light of a holy God.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.160]   And I saw in that moment that all of my sin
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.240]   was poured out on Him, and I got what He deserved,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.260]   and He got what I deserved.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.260]   And I remember experiencing this incredible conversion
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.200]   where I'm like, "Hey, man, I'm empty.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.840]   I'm unsatisfied and unfulfilled."
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.960]   And it's because the proverb says,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.520]   "There's a way that seems right to man,
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.680]   but that way ends in death."
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.000]   And tonight, God is saying, "Hey, if you want life,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.800]   then you'll pursue this thing called community."
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.760]   And what I quickly learned is that God never calls you
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.720]   from something until He calls,
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.160]   He will never call you from something
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.360]   without calling you to something.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.440]   And one of the very first things He called me to
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.480]   was to change my playground and my playmates.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.120]   In other words, those places that I would hang out,
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.680]   those people that I would hang out with,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.880]   He said, "Hey, if you're gonna be my man, Josiah,
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.920]   then you gotta start changing where you hang out,
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.200]   where you go on the weekends, and who you hang out with."
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.640]   And sometimes people come up to me and like,
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.960]   "Dude, pornography, sex addiction, lying,
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.560]   partying, stealing, like those things,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.480]   like how did you do it?"
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.880]   And I look at them and say, "Hey, I got with some men
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.740]   that wanted to be about it.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.800]   I got with some men that really loved Jesus.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.120]   They didn't just talk about it,
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.780]   but they really wanted to live out who He is."
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.920]   And so I know everyone here for a fact,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.360]   if you're saying you wanna have a relationship with Jesus,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.920]   or you say you have one, you're saying you wanna grow,
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.200]   and if you're not saying you wanna grow,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.760]   then it might be because you don't have
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.860]   a relationship with Jesus.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.480]   Because at that time at church camp
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.880]   where you committed your life to Him,
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.440]   it was never for you just to go home
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.760]   and wait for Jesus to return.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   It was for you to grow your faith so it becomes beautiful
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.240]   and it becomes attractive to a watching world.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.700]   And I always wonder what would my life look like
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.720]   if I never plugged into community?
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.800]   I might be an addict.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:42.200]   I mean, I could be lying and cheating and stealing.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:47.960]   Man, I could be this person that takes advantage of others.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.880]   I mean, I could be the all-star tailgater
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.560]   at the Cowboys game talking about how I never made it,
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.060]   getting drunk before the game.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.920]   I could be playing video games
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.880]   at a really unhealthy level in my parents' house.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.800]   And I just think back, it's like,
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.380]   God, man, if I never made that decision,
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.400]   if you never caused me to have a desire
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.280]   to step out in faith and say, yes, I trust you,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.620]   even though this is hard,
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.860]   I wonder what my life would look like.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.400]   'Cause I get people come up to me all the time
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.920]   and they say, hey, what's God's will for my life?
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.040]   And the answer that I,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.060]   or the question that I respond to is this,
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.160]   do you have community?
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.760]   Well, there was this time where,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.120]   man, I got into community and there was this conflict
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.100]   and it just kind of broke off.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.920]   Man, there was this time where I got in community
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.740]   and there was some people
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.640]   that just began to talk bad about me.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.680]   And man, I just kind of walked away.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.200]   There was this time where there was some people
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.800]   that really weren't committed
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.240]   and I just decided not to be committed either.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.000]   There was this time when I walked in
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.520]   and man, these people are weird.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.860]   They're just weird, man.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.200]   And so I just say, all right,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.800]   well then, man, with all the love that I can share with you,
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.320]   don't complain that you can't hear from God
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.800]   because one of God's greatest provisions in our life
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.240]   is he gives us trusted men and women who love him
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.900]   and are a voice for him in our life.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.760]   Listen, I'm not trying to beat you up.
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.520]   Like I get it, community is hard.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.680]   I've made the same excuses before.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.560]   I mean, just recently, I'll close with this.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.460]   About 10 months ago, I moved to Dallas from Kansas City.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.400]   And man, things were going well in Kansas City.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.560]   Ministry was growing and things were comfortable
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.640]   and I had my community.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.600]   I had men in my life that I cherished and I loved
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.160]   and man, God began to continue to move.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.480]   But then all of a sudden out of nowhere,
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.320]   which God does this sometimes,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.440]   he began to lay this move to Dallas
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.400]   and be a part of Watermark Church and the porch
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.220]   on my wife and I's heart.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.100]   And so we couldn't shake it anymore
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.120]   and we decided to make a decision to move to Dallas.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.920]   And so we got in the car and packed up all of our stuff
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.480]   and drove down with my two little girls.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.200]   And let me just be honest,
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.960]   man, this has been one of the hardest seasons of my life.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   And I actually started to pursue community and it got hard.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.720]   And there was a little bit of conflict.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.960]   And I caught myself saying the same excuses
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.580]   that I hear other people make.
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.180]   Oh man, it's hard and then there's this conflict
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.180]   and people just don't understand me.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.620]   Man, people just, they don't understand a move.
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.900]   Like they don't understand what we've gone through.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.720]   And I started making excuses after excuses
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.680]   until I had a couple of men in my life
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.120]   sharpen me like Proverbs 27, six says,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:56.960]   "Faithful are the wounds of a friend,
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.320]   but an enemy multiplies kiss."
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.980]   And they said, "Hey, you gotta keep pursuing it.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.560]   You can't just check out Josiah.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.720]   This is the worst time for you to check out."
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.580]   And they began to love me and push me into community
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.840]   where now I'm seeing God move like never before.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.040]   And listen, I want that for you tonight.
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.520]   More importantly, God wants that for you tonight
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.580]   where you can experience what we've been talking about
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.280]   even though I know it's hard
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.840]   and I don't wanna be insensitive.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:34.740]   But in the same way I had brothers come into my life
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.960]   and tell me what I didn't wanna hear,
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.200]   in the same way I'm sharing this tonight
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.960]   because some of you who are listening need to hear this.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.840]   And so tonight, let me pray that you would.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.640]   God in heaven, Lord, we need you.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.320]   I need you.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.160]   This has been an incredible reminder for me
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   that when I don't want to read your word
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:09.440]   and do what it says, you put people in my life
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.280]   to challenge my thinking, to encourage me,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   to push me to places where I don't wanna go.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.320]   And I've said this over and over tonight,
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.840]   but I thank you, God,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.020]   because that is one of your greatest provisions.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.660]   And I pray for my friends who are listening to this tonight
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:31.660]   that they would understand your will for their life
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.640]   when it comes to community,
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.160]   when it comes to people in their life
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:40.360]   that you want to introduce them to
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.240]   and you want them to lock arms with.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.840]   And I pray that they would stop at nothing until they do.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.760]   I don't care what barriers come into their life
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.200]   to try to keep them from community.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.400]   God, would you push through those barriers
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.360]   and would you give them the power
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.320]   and would you give them the strength
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.360]   to do what only you can do.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.040]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
