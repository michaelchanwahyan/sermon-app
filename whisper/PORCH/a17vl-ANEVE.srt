1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Here lies the old me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The kid my parents wanted me to be.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 All the ways the world hurt me.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Goodbye to my fears and anxieties.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 The reason why my ex left me.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Rest in peace to the old me.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 All right, let's go! 2022!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Man, you guys.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 2022 looks good on y'all.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Welcome everybody in the room, everybody joining us online

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 to the 14 PortsLive locations.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I want to highlight Ports Indy, Ports Boise, Idaho, Midland, Texas,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Scottsdale, Arizona, Cincinnati, Ohio, Austin, Texas, Fayetteville,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 and all the other locations.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 We're continuing a series called RIP, Rest in Peace to the Old Me.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 17,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 "If anyone is in Christ, if you have put your trust and faith

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 in what Jesus did on the cross, his death and resurrection,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 you have been made new."

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 You are a new creation, whether you feel like it,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 whether you believe it, God says you are new.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And the Christian journey is now learning to live the new life

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 and who God says that you are currently.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And tonight we're going to explore and dive back in

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and cover another topic.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 If you missed last week, JD did an awesome job

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 covering RIP to the victim mentality.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 How do I live as a victor, not a victim?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 And tonight we're going to cover another message or topic

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 that I think is crucial for you to understand

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 and for me to understand, according to Jesus,

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 if we are going to experience the abundant life

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 full of purpose and vitality and that he desires for us.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And so to do that, I'm going to start with a story,

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 illustration from kind of the past few days in my life.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 In Dallas, Texas, as everyone in the room knows,

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 in the past week we had a snowstorm.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It was 70 degrees and then it was 12 degrees

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 because we're Texas, that's how we roll.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And because of that, there was snow and ice on the ground

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 and I've got kids, I've got a six-year-old, a three-year-old.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Oh, I forgot to tell you all, and we had a baby.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 That's why I haven't been here.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 This is baby bear Michael.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Just cheeks, man, cheeks for days, the best.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And so I took, because it was snowing outside,

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I took the six-year-old, my son, and my three-year-old daughter

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 and we do what you do when you're six and three

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 and there's snow on the ground.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 You go attempt to make a snowman.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And this was a challenging feat

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 because most snow is ice on the ground.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So we're trying to pile things together and get it to stick.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But eventually we got the snowman to work.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And I tell my son, all right, we got the three-ball layer.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 We need to get eyes.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I want you to go inside, ask Mom for Oreos.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 He goes inside, comes back out with raspberries.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I said, Oreos?

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 He said, I know, but my favorite color is red.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Can we do red?

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And I say, I don't think that's going to go well,

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 putting raspberries for the eyes and it's going to melt.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 It's not going to end up looking how you want it to look.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I think we should go Oreos.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 No, Dad, my favorite color is red.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Let's go red.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And so we did raspberry eyes.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And I posted it on Instagram, so you may have seen it,

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 but there we are.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Looks like a snowman from a horror movie.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 It's like Olaf meets Blair Witch Project or something.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And I was right.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 That decision took and led to things looking not exactly

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 how he or anyone wanted them to look.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Now tonight I want to talk about a topic and a teaching that

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Jesus is going to paint a picture for us and give us some

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 instructions and say, if you and I don't follow these

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 instructions, it's not going to end up with a life that looks

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 the way you want it to look.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And further, he's going to say, it's not going to end up with an

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 eternity that looks how you want it to look.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I think tonight's message is as crucial for us who live in

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 America, who live in Dallas, who live in Scottsdale,

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 who live in the most affluent country that the world has ever

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 known to understand, because Jesus is going to say some

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 really profound things about the danger of a very common belief

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 or a very common goal that a lot of us have,

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 specifically called the American dream.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 So tonight we're talking about rest in peace to living for the

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 American dream.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And hello to living for eternity.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Now what do I mean by the American dream?

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Now let me get the cards.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I love America.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 You know, I got USA socks.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I'm not wearing them right now, but I would.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I love America.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 This has nothing to do with being anti-America,

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 but giving your life to the vision of, man,

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 a white picket fence.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I got the house, got the spouse, got the 2.5 kids and a golden

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 retriever, and I can retire early.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 What Jesus would say is a foolish thing to give your life to

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 in light of eternity.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And it is probably the thing that most,

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 as much as anything else, we're so inundated because we've only

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 lived in a world where wealth is constantly telling us we don't

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 have enough, we don't have enough.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So tonight we're going to explore some profound teaching of Jesus

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 that I don't want to be instruction for just your 20s or

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 for your 30s, but to paint a picture,

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 or God's going to paint a picture for what to give your life to.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 In other words,

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 I hope the application buries into your soul and your mind and you

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 and your spouse someday spend the rest of your life giving your life

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 to what Jesus says matters.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Rest in peace to the American dream and hello to living for

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 eternity.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 So we're going to look at three reasons why the American dream is a

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 foolish thing to give your life to.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 We're going to start in Luke chapter 12.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Jesus is in the middle of teaching and something happens.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 That's funny as Jesus has been teaching in Luke chapter 12.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 He's in the middle of a sermon.

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That's kind of talking about heaven.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 It's talking about hell and it's talking about acknowledging Jesus and a

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 guy in the crowd begins to speak up and almost heckle Jesus and say,

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Hey, Hey, Hey, all that heaven, hell stuff.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 That's great question real quick.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And he begins to ask a question and it's related to the topic of money.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And Jesus uses that to springboard into the dangers of pursuing what

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 today we would describe as the American dream.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So I'm going to start in verse 13 of Luke chapter 12.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Also, if you don't have a Bible,

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 we have some in the welcome center that are our gift to you.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 You can pick up right after the service.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Verse 13.

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Now someone in the crowd said to him, Jesus, teacher,

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Jesus replied, man,

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Then he said to them, so he takes his comment.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 He's like, what do I have to do with that?

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And then he addresses the man and the crowd based on what the manager said,

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 watch out and be on guard against all kinds of greed.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Life does not consist in the abundance of possessions,

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 which had to sting.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 If you're that guy, it's so savage.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Jesus guy says, Hey, will you tell my brother he didn't share the inheritance.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I want you to come with me, go to the house, tell my brother,

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Carl to give me my share of the inheritance.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And Jesus says, let's talk about greed for a second guys.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Is this is a clear example of how we're able to be tempted or fall in the trap

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 of greed.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And then he goes right into a story.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Here's the story.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And he told them this parable, which is another word for story.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 So there's a guy had a farm, had lots of crops that grew.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 He thought to himself, what shall I do?

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I don't have any place to store my crops.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Then he said, this is what I'll do.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And there I will store my surplus grain.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And I'll say to myself, this guy talks to himself a lot in the story,

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 but I say to myself, you have plenty of grain laid up for many years.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Take life easy, eat, drink, and be married.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Now Jesus stopped the story right there.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 He's talking to an audience that was incredibly poor, first century poverty.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And he's talking to an audience that was also agricultural,

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 agragarian, and that the ability to have tons of grain for the rest of your life,

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 this was not just the American dream.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 This was the Jerusalem dream.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Times 10.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 We think, man, it would be amazing to be able to stop and to retire.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 People did not retire in this day and age.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So this man has hit the jackpot.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And they're probably thinking as they hear, dude, that is the dream.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Maybe Jesus can tell us how this man was able to accomplish that

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 and how he was able to succeed and make that happen.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And then the story takes a turn.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 "But God said to him, 'You fool, this very night your life will be demanded from you.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 but is not rich towards God.'"

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So this is a guy, has this big harvest, lots of crops, says to himself,

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 you know what, I'm just going to store all this food, make even bigger barns,

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 and I'll be able to live for the rest of my life, kick it up, and retire early.

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And Jesus says, "And then the man dies.

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And all that he had accumulated and gotten for himself and put together for himself

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 was totally lost, and he didn't get to experience the Jerusalem dream

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 or the American dream."

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 He was looking just--all of his accomplishments or really wealth to find security.

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And Jesus reminds his audience, there is no security in wealth.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 That comes from one place, God.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 You can have all the money in the world and not live to see or spend any of it.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 The first reason why the American dream is a bad thing to give your life to

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 is because it makes you a fool.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Pursuing or ruling or living out and being ruled by living for the American dream,

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 that's the first point, makes you a fool.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Do you know the only time in the Bible where God calls someone a fool is this man?

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I mean, think about that. Why?

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Jesus, are you like just against people having things?

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 We're just all supposed to be poor to follow Jesus? Is that what he's saying?

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 No. He's saying, but if you live for just accumulating and getting the house

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and getting the car and getting the job and getting the lake house

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 and getting the ability to retire early, you're a fool.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And you have spent your life and wasted it.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And Jesus' point is not anti-stuff.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 He doesn't want the stuff to be the focus and the pursuit of your life.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 This honestly is so convicting because I think in America,

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 we're candidly numb to how much we have.

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I said earlier, America is the wealthiest country in the history of the world.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 There was a missionary who joined our staff for staff prayer.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 We have a meeting every Tuesday morning for a couple hours, meet together, pray,

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 share stories of what God is doing.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He joined us and he had been gone from the States for 10 years.

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 And he joined and somebody asked him his first time back in Dallas,

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 just kind of on furlough, and they said,

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 "What's changed in the last 10 years since you left?"

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And I'll never forget his answer.

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 He very quickly said, "Oh, all the storage units."

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And in the audience, we all had the same response like,

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 "What is he talking about, storage units?"

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And then I drove around that day and you begin to look for them

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 and they're everywhere.

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Do you know that the number of storage units--

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 and by that I mean like the facilities where you go and you have so much stuff

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 you can't fit it in your house, so you're like,

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 "Honey, we got to rent out a small cube to put some of our stuff in there."

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 The United States has 25 times more of those than all of Europe combined.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 There are more storage unit facilities--I don't mean units like a single box,

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 I mean facilities, companies, franchises--in the United States

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 than all of McDonald's, Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS, and 7-Eleven combined.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 We are inundated with how much stuff.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And Jesus' teaching is there is no amount of stuff that will leave you satisfied.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 You can have all the abundance of possessions,

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 but that's not what life is ultimately about.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And our culture tells us that, man, if you just had more,

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 if you just had more, if you just had more,

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 it would scratch some need, it would leave you fulfilled.

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And it tells us that the game of life is kind of like Monopoly.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I mean, at the heart of the American dream is the idea that that game you played

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 growing up, Monopoly, where you try to buy as much stuff as you can,

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 and the winner at the end is the person who has the most.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 The Bible says that's not true at all.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Jesus is going to tell us that life is a lot more like the game of Uno.

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 You guys remember Uno? Your grandma plays Uno?

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Most of you probably haven't played because you're not over 85,

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 but Uno is this game where the winner is not who has the most cards,

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 it's the one who gives or gets rid of the most.

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And Jesus is going to say, ultimately, life is not about acquiring and getting more.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 It is about giving more to the only kingdom that will last, which is Christ's.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Don't live your life. Don't be foolish.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And he says this man was a fool because the American dream,

259
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 if it's pursued at the extent of knowing God and making him known,

260
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 it makes you a fool.

261
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And in inverse, living for eternity is the only thing that can make you full on the inside,

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 like F-U-L-L.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Living for the American dream makes you a fool.

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 But living for eternity is not just something that's going to have impact for eternity.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It fills, it satisfies because you were made for it.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And Jesus looks into the eyes of this man and to his crowd and says,

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 "Don't buy the lie that you're here to just acquire and acquire."

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 There's a friend of mine who tells this story about the time his company went public,

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 and he became a billionaire overnight.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And he says, "There was a party in this hotel that we were at.

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It just went public. Everyone's downstairs. They're all celebrating.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And I just became a billionaire.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And I went back up to my hotel room, and I started working again.

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And I wasn't following Jesus, I just wasn't able to be satisfied

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 because he wasn't following Jesus.

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And even turning a billionaire overnight didn't satisfy

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 because there is no amount of wealth, status, success that can, but Jesus can.

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And Jesus says, "If you spend your life buying the lie the world around you sells,

279
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 the American dream is what it's all about, you're a fool.

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And so am I. But if you spend your life living for eternity, it will make you full on the inside."

281
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And then he launches in to another challenge that pursuit of the American dream creates.

282
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 He says this, "And then he said to his disciples,

283
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 'I tell you, do not worry about your life.'" He brings up anxiety,

284
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 which is at the heart of, honestly, why a lot of us want to have and get more and have more in the bank.

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 "'What you will wear about what you eat or your body, what you will wear.

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 For life is more than food and the body more than clothes.

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Consider the ravens. They do not sow or reap. They have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them.

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Are you not more valuable than God?'" Translation, "God will provide for you."

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 "'Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?

290
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Do not, since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?'"

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Brings up another illustration, "'Consider the flowers of the field.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 They don't labor or spend, I tell you, not even Solomon in all of his splendor was dressed like one of these.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 If that's how God clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown in the fire,

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 how much more will he clothe you? You of little faith.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about it.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 For the pagans," those are people of the world, those are people who do not know God, he's saying,

297
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 "'They run after all those things, and your Father knows you need them.

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But seek his kingdom and these things will be given to you.'"

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 What is Jesus saying? There's so much there, we don't have time to unpack, but he's driving home.

300
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 "'You have a heavenly Father who will provide for you.'

301
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Chasing the American dream is often fueled by fear of, like, 'I'm going to get more.

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I need to accumulate more. I need to have enough so that I can retire.

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I need to have enough to pay for kids. I need to have enough so that I can get married.'

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And Jesus says, 'Those all are ingrained with the lie that you are the source of provision in your life,

305
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 and that will create anxiety. Living for the American dream makes you anxious.'"

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 This is why the man in the story is driven to go to Jesus and take his one shot with the Son of God

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 and say, "Jesus, the heaven and hell stuff, that's great.

308
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Hey, will you tell my brother to give me some money?" Fear drives us.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Often, fear of not being seen as successful creates an anxiety that,

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 "I'm not living up to other people's opinions or the standards or where I should be

311
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 or where, you know, my friends are in this stage of life."

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And Jesus is saying, "Living for some version of what the world says is success is foolish,

313
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 and it will make you anxious."

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 The second idea is that living for the American dream will make you anxious.

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And Jesus says, "The solution to your anxiety is not more money.

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 It is a deeper understanding of who your God is, how he has promised, 'I will provide for you.'

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 I will ultimately provide for you on the cross where I gave my life for your greatest needs.'"

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 That's what Christians believe if you're not a follower of Jesus.

319
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 They don't believe good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 They believe Jesus went through hell for us so that we wouldn't have to.

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 He came to earth, died in our place as the payment for our sin,

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and then he rose from the dead showing the payment cleared.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 It was more than enough. That's what Christians believe.

324
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And he not only provided there, Jesus says, "And God will provide for your needs."

325
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Not for the path of success that you want, not for everything that you want in life,

326
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 but he will provide for your needs. You can trust him.

327
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 And if you chase after, "I need to accomplish and succeed and live up to what everybody says," is the goal.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's a recipe for being anxious because living for the American dream just creates anxiety.

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 As one great poet, Biggie, said, "More money, more problems."

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And we think it's a solution, and Jesus says, "It's not a solution.

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 You can have everything that everyone else wants and be miserable."

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 This is a girl named Chelsea Crist.

333
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Chelsea was Miss USA in 2019.

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 She was a lawyer who also had her MBA.

335
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 She was a model, D1 athlete at one point in time, incredibly successful, top 10 in Miss Universe,

336
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 was on Extra as a TV correspondent. She was an Emmy nominated.

337
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And 10 days ago, she took her life.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 She's beautiful.

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Everything the world would say matters.

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Everything you would want, and it didn't satisfy.

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It created angst, anxiety, depression.

342
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Because everything the world says matters, you can't fill the part of your soul that was made by God for God.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And pursuing some version of success and what everyone says,

344
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 "This is the goal, and this is the car, and these are the clothes, and this is the way to look,

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 this is the number of followers, and this is the house to have."

346
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 It can't fulfill the part of you that only God can.

347
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And you can either spend your life chasing and striving after that,

348
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 only to arrive at the epitome of what everyone would say is success and find it doesn't.

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Or you can look to the one source that can, which is Jesus and a relationship of walking in line with him.

350
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I've been doing this a long time, and I have seen how chasing the American dream has left young adults empty,

351
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 their families empty. I've sat with young adults in tears who have more money than I will ever have,

352
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 who don't have to work at all, and they, through tears, cry out how money destroyed my family.

353
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And the temptation for us is, you know, we're young adults, you're poor, you're like, "I got college debt."

354
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 You're like, "You know, I bet we could handle it."

355
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And the truth is, money is not a solution for your anxiety.

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 It's not a solution for the biggest needs and biggest problems that you have.

357
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Money is not a bad thing, but it doesn't offer you what Jesus can,

358
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 which is a solution for that hole that exists in every heart and every person,

359
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 that no amount of status, success, home can ever fulfill.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And he says, "You can trust your Father to provide."

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Living for the American dream makes you anxious.

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Living for eternity will give you peace.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And then Jesus goes into the next portion of the text that tells us what I think is

364
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 maybe the most tragic portion of this entire thing.

365
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 He says, "Do not be afraid, little flock."

366
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's pretty tender language.

367
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 I mean, you know the scene. He's sitting there in front of this audience.

368
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Man just chimes up from the crowd, and Jesus is like, "Man, let me talk about this,

369
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 because this is going to be a big pitfall for a lot of people.

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 They're going to chase and seek something and accumulating or getting stuff.

371
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 It's not going to work."

372
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And then he ends with, "So don't be afraid.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Sell your possessions and give to the poor.

375
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out.

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 A treasure in heaven that will never fail,

377
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 where no thief can come near it and steal, no moth could ever make it destroy.

378
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."

379
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 He says, "When you begin to live for eternity, something begins to shift in your heart.

380
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And when you live just for this life, something happens,

381
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 and at the end of this life, it will leave you eternally bankrupt.

382
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Perhaps the greatest tragedy of the American dream is it makes you only focus

383
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 and get so narrow focused on this life and leaves you eternally bankrupt."

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 The third idea from the text we see is living for this life only

385
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 or living for the American dream leaves you bankrupt.

386
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 He introduces to a topic of I think why Jesus is so passionate about money.

387
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 He says there's a relationship between money and what you treasure and your heart.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Do you know that Jesus, more than anybody else in the Bible, talks about money?

389
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 2,000 verses, he talks about money.

390
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 He talks about it more than he talks about heaven and hell combined.

391
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Why? Because Jesus wants you to be poor and he's against money? No.

392
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Because he knows more than anything else in this life,

393
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 money competes to sit on the throne of your heart,

394
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 to make you feel a sense of control, security, peace,

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 can distract you like nothing else or like few other things away from God

396
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 and build you up and make you think through pride you created what you have.

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Jesus isn't against money. He doesn't want your money to have you.

398
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It's not against you having money.

399
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And nothing like it competes for your heart.

400
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Verses on prayer are 500. There's four times as many verses on money.

401
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Because Jesus knows nothing in this life competes for your heart like wealth.

402
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Which means living in America, the wealthiest country on the planet,

403
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 and living in cities like this or in suburbs or in affluent areas like Scottsdale

404
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 and like Boise and like Dallas and like Austin

405
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 and like all the different locations listening in right now,

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 is one of the most dangerous places you can be for your faith.

407
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Because nothing according to Jesus, where your treasure is, your heart will be also.

408
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 In other words, your heart's going to follow wherever your treasure is.

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 It's competing for your heart like money.

410
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And we live in a world that is unbelievably inundated in wealth

411
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 and how much you don't have and what you need.

412
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 There was a friend that was on staff a few years ago. His name was Paul.

413
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And he moved his family to West Dallas.

414
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And if you're listening, that's just a poorer area or higher poverty area of Dallas.

415
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 And certainly was at the time, 10 years ago.

416
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And somebody asked him the question. He had kids.

417
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And he said, "Aren't you concerned about it not being that safe?"

418
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And he responded with something that I don't think I'll ever forget.

419
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And it was so convicting.

420
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 You think the affluent suburbs are safe?

421
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 You think living in some of the wealthiest areas in the country are safe?

422
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 You think raising kids around all the environments where everyone has a Range Rover

423
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 and the amount of drugs that they'll introduce, do you think that's safe?

424
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 No.

425
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 It's every bit as dangerous as being in a place that has a higher crime rate.

426
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 It's just a different type of danger. And it may even be worse.

427
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And Jesus would say, "You and I are to be on guard

428
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 because nothing competes for your heart like money,

429
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 like getting more stuff, like having more,

430
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 more clothes, the right car."

431
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And it does something to our heart.

432
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And he also gives us an invitation that, "Hey, anything you invest for my kingdom

433
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 will last for all of eternity."

434
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He's not trying to get you away from having nice things.

435
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He's trying to get you to see life in a right perspective,

436
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 to see your world, to see the opportunity,

437
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 to see your 20s, your 30s, your life in a right perspective.

438
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And it's a focus and refocus how we see.

439
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 There was something called the Hubble Telescope that went into space in 1990.

440
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 It was almost $2 billion to create,

441
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 and it basically was the telescope that went up into space.

442
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I think we have a picture of it.

443
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 That allowed us to take images from space.

444
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I mean, it was amazing.

445
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It's incredible that NASA produced and sent off into space,

446
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 and it would allow us to see far distances into the universe

447
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and also allow us to capture accurate footage of our world

448
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 and to see it more clearly.

449
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And they sent it up there, and, you know, tons of anticipation,

450
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 billions of dollars spent.

451
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 It's finally up in the air,

452
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 and they send back the very first images from space,

453
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 from the Hubble Telescope.

454
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And they get them back, and they're all blurry.

455
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 That's a bad day for somebody at work, man.

456
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Carl!

457
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And they realize in order for us to bring it back down here,

458
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 it had not been calibrated rightly on the lenses.

459
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 In order for us to bring it back down, it would be far too expensive.

460
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 In order for us to send another one out, it would be billions of dollars.

461
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 So they came up with a plan.

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 We're going to make giant contact lenses

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 that we're going to send up into space,

464
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 and astronauts are going to attach contact lenses

465
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 onto the outside of the Hubble Telescope.

466
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And it worked.

467
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And we were able to see in perspective

468
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 these crystal clear, beautiful images of our planet.

469
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 There's one from the Hubble Telescope

470
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 where formerly it was out of focus,

471
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and then those lenses just-- everything came into focus.

472
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 This is what Jesus is attempting to do through his teaching.

473
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 He's not telling them that, hey, you living a life where you have nice things,

474
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 you have a good job, you get out of debt,

475
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 or you have a car and you live in a house someday is bad things.

476
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 What he is saying is you spending your life

477
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 living for your kingdom, building into your kingdom,

478
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 spending not just your 20s, I mean all of your life,

479
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 investing in acquiring more stuff and having more things

480
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 and having a life that everyone in the world says is successful

481
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 is going to leave you eternally bankrupt.

482
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Yet you spending your life investing in my kingdom,

483
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 serving and sharing in my kingdom

484
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 is going to leave you eternally with treasures that will never fade,

485
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 a reward that cannot be taken from you.

486
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Nothing you invest in this life can be taken.

487
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 And candidly, my fear, because this generation just haven't done this for a while,

488
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 there is a higher level of materialism

489
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 in young adults today,

490
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 in the church today,

491
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 than just a few years ago there were.

492
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And I don't know what happened, and I certainly--

493
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 it's been a challenge for me this week

494
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 addressing what happened.

495
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Maybe it was social media and the fact that everything everyone wears

496
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 gets posted everywhere and there's all this pressure to look some certain way.

497
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And it's like the church all of a sudden shifted from this radical, reckless,

498
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 whatever you want from me, Jesus, take it all.

499
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I'll give anything and everything. I want to live for your kingdom.

500
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I'm not living for what other people think

501
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 and what car that I drive and the house that I have.

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I want to live for you.

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It's like that has shrunk in the hearts of your people.

504
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And not all of them.

505
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 There are men and women who,

506
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 just like that Hubble telescope,

507
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 they see things in perspective.

508
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 They see life. They see our world more clearly.

509
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 And this life more clearly.

510
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And they're not giving their 20s, they're not giving themselves

511
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 to living for a kingdom that's going to fade, which is theirs.

512
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Which is any kingdom that is not Jesus.

513
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Think about this man's question

514
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and how narrow focus he is.

515
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 I'm about to land the plane.

516
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 He's standing in front of the son of God.

517
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 He's got a shot to talk to Jesus.

518
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Very few people who ever lived got that shot.

519
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Think about how small and petty what he asked for is.

520
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 How much was the inheritance?

521
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Five grand, which would have been enormous in that day and age.

522
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And he's standing before Jesus, he's like,

523
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 "Jesus, I want you to come with me, come to my house,

524
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 "and I want you to talk to my brother."

525
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 In the same way, think about how small

526
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 the perspective of living for the American dream,

527
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 that, "Hey, I'm going to get the car, good, get the car,

528
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 "then what? Then I'm going to get the house, good,

529
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 "you got the house, then what?

530
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 "Oh, I got to have the spouse, okay, you got the spouse,

531
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 "then what? Then we're going to have kids, okay, then what?

532
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 "Then I'm going to have a golden retriever,

533
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 "and then I'm going to retire, then what?"

534
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 You think that's going to fill anything?

535
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Are you really going to give your life to something

536
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 that's going to fade, that doesn't satisfy,

537
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 that story after story after story tells you,

538
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 and Jesus, on the planet, says,

539
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 "You are wasting your life."

540
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Or, are you going to use the gifts God has given you,

541
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 the time God has given you, the finances God has given you,

542
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 the story God has given you, to say,

543
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 "I am going to live for Jesus and my generation.

544
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 "I want to go all in with you, Christ, use my life.

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 "Take me and use me as a force in a really dark world for you.

546
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 "I want to make your name great, not my name great."

547
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And in doing so, Jesus says,

548
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 "Invest in the only kingdom that will last, which is his."

549
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 In conclusion, living for the American dream

550
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 leaves you bankrupt eternally.

551
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Living for eternity leaves you rich.

552
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Living for the American dream makes you a fool.

553
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Living for eternity will make you filled and full.

554
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Living for the American dream makes you anxious.

555
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 But living in light of eternity with the God of eternity

556
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 brings you peace.

557
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 That snowman, because we're in Texas,

558
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 something happens when two days later it's 70 degrees.

559
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 It goes away.

560
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And all that snow and all that was created, it's gone.

561
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Let me tell you my biggest fear for this room.

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 That snowman is a picture for how many people spend their life.

563
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 They work and they build, they create, they mass,

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 they get their house, get the job, build the company,

565
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 put it all together.

566
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 And just like the snowman, when the sun comes back, it's gone.

567
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And when the sun comes back, the son of God,

568
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 you will have built a kingdom that will not last,

569
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 invested your life in something Jesus said is foolish.

570
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Not 'cause he's against you having nice things.

571
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 He's against things having you and you giving your life to them.

572
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And so we rest in peace to the American dream

573
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 'cause you were made for something far bigger and far greater

574
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 and are put on this planet for a purpose to know God,

575
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 to make him known, to not waste your life building snowmen

576
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 that will fade, but to build a kingdom.

577
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 The Bible says it's unshakable, that will last for all of eternity

578
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 for those who know him.

579
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And anything they built towards that will last for all of eternity.

580
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Let me pray.

581
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Father, I pray that you would unleash in our generation

582
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 men and women who serve you and live for you with reckless abandon.

583
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 They wouldn't get caught up and distracted in the temptations

584
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 of the cities and places and spaces we live in.

585
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Of all the things the world says, this is what success is,

586
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 this is what matters.

587
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And for that to happen, God, we need your help.

588
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Would you take ground in our heart, the places in our heart

589
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 that run after the things of this world,

590
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 that seek security in things that ultimately can't provide it,

591
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 that find our identity or our worth or find peace in things

592
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 that are fleeting, and we'd find them in you,

593
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 and we would live radically for you.

594
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Thank you, dear God, who radically gave his life for us

595
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 so that anyone who trusts in Jesus would spend all of eternity

596
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 with him in the only kingdom that will last, his.

597
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 We worship you now in song.

598
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Amen.
