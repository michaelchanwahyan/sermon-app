1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
 One time when he went to the bathroom for a few minutes

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,600
 I may or may not have stolen his Bible and saw that everything is highlighted. It's so worn out. Oh my gosh

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,960
 Well the guy I'm into I just love the way he worships

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,080
 I wouldn't get closer to him so our Holy Spirits can worship together

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,920
 All right, I don't even know what that means I

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,280
 Feel like they should run these videos by me or something

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:43,000
 Man it's good to be with you guys this evening. I just got back today this this morning or I guess around lunch

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,440
 I got back to work from a fishing trip

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,080
 I went out with my brother and my dad and two brother-in-laws who went to the bay

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,800
 out to the coast about six hours from here and

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,880
 Went Saturday and Sunday and so we go out Saturday my dad takes us out and and

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,300
 You know you wake up. I don't know if you've done this before saltwater fishing, but you wake up early and

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:10,400
 Get all the poles fishing poles ready pack the ice chest you know get everything geared up

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,500
 You got your fishing gear on and then you you get the boat already loaded up on the trailer

15
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,240
 And then you drive it still dark outside the Sun hadn't come up

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,640
 And then you you back it up

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,680
 And you put the boat in and then you go out there in the ocean and and you're fishing you know you're casting and reeling

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,960
 And and then the Sun comes up, and it just gets hot okay like South, Texas crazy

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,120
 Hades kind of hot and so

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,360
 We're doing that thing and and we don't catch anything

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,400
 Nothing, I mean like we move around like hey, let's go try over here. You know hey

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,640
 Let's let's try this they cast over there in the weeds. Let's go open ocean. You know I'm like you know that boat over

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
 There's catching something why don't we go by them?

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,320
 You know and so we just don't catch anything my dad like caught a flounder

25
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,960
 That's all we caught all day long and and so we come back in and then we go out the next day

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,920
 Which was Sunday and this time we go with a guide so we hired a guide and we go out

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,000
 But then which is a lot better because you just show up you wake up you show up you get on a boat

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,680
 I mean he does everything he's baiting the hook everything and and so before the Sun comes up we limit out on redfish

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,920
 18 redfish and and five trout. I mean that's that's a good day of

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,560
 Fishing and here's what I learned through this whole experience

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,480
 Okay, I mean we were back in before lunch done can't catch any more fish right and I learned

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,740
 That I hate fishing okay

33
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,700
 I

34
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,580
 really enjoy

35
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,800
 Catching that's fun fish on the hook. You know reeling it in fighting it getting it in the boat

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,940
 Catching is a lot of fun fishing on the other hand is

37
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,340
 Miserable okay now now right about now

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,900
 You should be rolling your eyes because you're like all the pastor talking on dating and he's got a bit fishing metaphor

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,460
 You know and I get it I get it okay. It's cliche

40
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,940
 But it's cliche for a reason right it's cliche for a reason because we say things like oh

41
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,440
 She's a good catch, and he's a keeper and there's plenty of fish in the sea

42
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,700
 and the reason

43
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,820
 It's a good metaphor. I mean it works it carries so that you're gonna hear some of it so but here's the deal

44
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,460
 Some of us are completely content with dating

45
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,660
 And we've we've lost this whole idea that dating is this not the end of itself like dating is supposed to lead somewhere

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,740
 And so some of us like we bought into this lie from the world and we've been dating since the fifth grade or fourth grade

47
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,180
 Or some of you second grade right some of you preschool, and so here's the deal right?

48
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,420
 We've been doing that this whole time we forget that the dating is just a means to it's a means to marriage

49
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,660
 God did not invent dating God invented the finish line

50
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,180
 Marriage was his invention dating was our invention not even that long ago as a euphemism for prostitution

51
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,260
 That's honestly where it came from I'm not kidding when dating came on the scene it meant prostitution true story look it up

52
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,060
 history of dating and

53
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,580
 So dating is supposed to lead to this thing and so if you're like hey

54
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,260
 I like day you're like those guys that man. I love fishing like you catch eating no nothing

55
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,420
 But we were out there just casting and reeling. I was great. I'm like that's stupid. That's not great

56
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,700
 That's miserable can't eat anything. No fish. You know what it was that about right?

57
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,540
 Dating if you're having fun in

58
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,260
 Dating like if you're completely satisfied in it. You're doing it wrong

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,660
 That's the truth like if you're just like I'm not dating that's that's that's great man date the rest of my life

60
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,380
 No, no in the scripture. We have two options. There's a there's a call to singleness

61
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,820
 sometimes

62
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,540
 Our desire sometimes God's desire for us, and then there's marriage. There's no call to dating

63
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:20,820
 All right now girls stop elbowing your boyfriend. Okay, that's not we're not about that. It's not that stay with me

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,980
 Okay, I see you and so

65
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,300
 Dating is supposed to lead to this thing

66
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,220
 And so tonight I want to talk about getting caught up in dating right we're weak to

67
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:40,500
 Save the date this series and we're just talking about this idea that that the goal is not dating in and of itself

68
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,220
 The goal is to go somewhere and if we don't know what the goal is like if you don't know what kind of fish you're trying

69
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,460
 To catch right then you don't know how to do it

70
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,220
 You've got to know what the goal in what the end is mine

71
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,020
 And the end is you got to keep the end in mind in order to get there

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,020
 And so in this series save the date we call it that it has a double meaning, right?

73
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,900
 It's not just a reminder that you get that somebody else is getting married and you wonder if you'll go with someone or go alone

74
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,940
 It's actually also a call to this idea that the world is doing it wrong

75
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,140
 Like what if you get up there you meet God? He's like, oh man you

76
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,740
 You did that thing all wrong

77
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,180
 Like we could have saved you a lot of heartache and a lot of time had you just read this book

78
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,860
 You're like, but it doesn't say anything about dating in there

79
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,020
 exactly

80
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
 That will be his point. Okay?

81
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,060
 And

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,300
 So last week we talked about dating detours

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,420
 Those detours were looking outside of God's people

84
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:48,380
 Giving into lustful desires and playing games if you missed it go back and listen to it online or via the porch app

85
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,060
 And so this week we're talking about getting caught up in dating last week

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,980
 We kind of looked at the life of Samson

87
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,180
 We looked at the life of Sanson and we and we basically focused on things that primarily men do now

88
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,540
 I'm not I don't mean generalizations

89
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,900
 I mean men and women make the same mistakes in dating but last week I focused a lot on the men

90
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
 I said hey, this is Samson's mistakes this week

91
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,260
 We're gonna look at the three women and I'm gonna talk to you ladies now men. You're gonna learn something, too

92
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,160
 You're gonna learn what's and what to avoid what not to look for in a woman women

93
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,380
 But women you're going to look at things that get you caught up in dating stuck

94
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,340
 stuck in singleness

95
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,460
 Stuck in discontentment as we look at the three women in this story of Samson judges 13

96
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,780
 14 and

97
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,980
 15

98
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:42,020
 And so let's dive in just to set this up right Israel is ruled by the Philistines this evil people

99
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,320
 Okay, they are ruling God's people

100
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:52,020
 And so God raises up a man that says the angel the Lord said verse 5 judges 13 verse 5 you will become pregnant

101
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,760
 He's talking to his mom who's barren who's never had kids

102
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:00,160
 Angel the Lord shows up says you're gonna become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor

103
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,700
 Because the boy is a Nazarite dedicated to God from the womb

104
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,460
 He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines. So Samson is coming on the scene

105
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,040
 He's gonna be set apart by God for an incredible mission, but he keeps getting hung up in this topic of dating

106
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,940
 He keeps getting stuck in relationships that cause him to lose sight of God's mission for his life

107
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,580
 And so just a quick disclaimer that I said last week in case you missed it. I don't think this story is about dating. I

108
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,960
 Don't think God preserved this story for thousands of years to teach us about dating

109
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,660
 I think this story is to teach us about God's faithfulness to use broken to people to bring about his will

110
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:48,420
 however, I think as we look at some of the poor choices Samson made we can learn a lot about dating as we apply it to

111
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,980
 our own lives and

112
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:57,060
 So where I'm headed we're gonna talk about fear control and desires that can get us caught up in dating fear

113
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,020
 Control and desires and so judges 14. Okay, Samson is now on the scene

114
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,420
 He goes to a neighboring area called Timna to God's enemies

115
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,940
 It says he sees a woman there and he likes her. He goes back to his parents mom dad. I saw a woman

116
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,300
 She's hot mom and dad say hey, you can't date her. That's not God's people

117
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,200
 Samson, why don't you find someone among God's people? He says God's people who cares. She's smoking hot

118
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,160
 It says in the Hebrew. She's no it says in the Hebrew

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,780
 Get her for me she looks good to me

120
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,780
 That's what it says says she looks good to me get her for me

121
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,120
 So him and his dad go and he takes her to coffee and he runs some game and he comes back in the scripture says

122
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,800
 That he enjoyed talking to her. He enjoyed the conversation

123
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,580
 He goes back to his people and then he goes back to marry her. So he travels back to her land

124
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,260
 He shows up. He says he throws a keg party or a big drinking party

125
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,500
 We know he's not supposed to drink as a Nazarite, but he does he throws this big party. He's gonna marry her

126
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 They give him 30 groomsmen true story the Philistines assigned 30 groomsmen to him

127
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,620
 And so Samson being this man's man tap out MMA, dude

128
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,180
 Like he's he's there and he's like, hey guys want a bet wanna bet something? Hey, I got a riddle

129
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,700
 You ready? And so he gives him this riddle and he makes a bet he's starting he's gambling at his own wedding

130
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,500
 I mean, that's what he's doing, right? And so he gambles with these 30 companions from the Philistines

131
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,900
 He gives him the riddle and he gives them seven days to solve it

132
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,900
 It's a bet, you know, they win or he wins who wins whoever wins get something

133
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,980
 Well, they go to his wife and they say hey

134
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,860
 You need to find out the answer to this riddle. And if you don't we're gonna set you on fire

135
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,780
 Okay. Yeah, it's pretty rash. Well anyways, so she goes to him

136
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,260
 She nags him to death until he tells her the answer and I'll jump into the scripture verses 16

137
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,380
 Then Samson's wife threw herself on him sobbing you hate me. You don't really love me

138
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,780
 You've given my people a riddle. You haven't told me the answer and you're manipulative. Okay, but let's go back

139
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,540
 I haven't even explained it to my father a mother he replied. So why should I explain it to you?

140
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,220
 She cried the whole seven. She cried the whole seven days of the feast

141
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,100
 Miserable so on the seventh day he finally told her because she continued to press him

142
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,780
 she in turn explained the riddle to her people and

143
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,260
 So the groomsmen come to him. They answer the riddle

144
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,020
 Samson calls his wife a cow

145
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,740
 Goes kills true story goes and kills 30 people takes their stuff and pays off his debt

146
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,180
 And so let me ask you a question

147
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,980
 This woman is

148
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,940
 Married to Superman. I mean, he's got super natural superhuman strength

149
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,860
 He's able to leap over tall buildings in a single battle

150
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,820
 Like why didn't she just go to him and say hey, by the way, Sam

151
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,040
 Sam shine these guys over here

152
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,100
 They said that if I don't tell them the riddle they're gonna set me on fire we can just handle that

153
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,180
 I mean, that's what she should have done. That would have solved all the problem. But what but why didn't she?

154
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,740
 Because this woman's ruled by fear

155
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,740
 It's my first point fear causes us to get caught up in dating

156
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,060
 Fear causes us to get caught up in dating

157
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,540
 her whole life is

158
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,500
 Being determined by men. Do you see that? She's being tossed and fro from the desires man

159
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,020
 She's sitting there helplessly waiting for some men to come into her life to determine her destiny

160
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,880
 And when he does and these other men come into her life and say no

161
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,760
 Let me tell you what to do so much so that this is what happens next judges 15 1 & 2

162
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,460
 Later on the time of the wheat harvest Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife if you're looking for a Valentine's

163
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
 Day gift there's one a young goat and so

164
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,580
 He said I'm going to my wife's room, but her father would not let him go in

165
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,420
 I was sure you hated her. He said so that I gave her to your companion

166
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,580
 Bomp-bomp-bomp. I mean what I mean is ladies. Do you ever feel this way?

167
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,520
 Like you're just sitting there helpless and vulnerable like man

168
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,420
 I have no idea what my future holds and it is completely up to some man that would come into my life steal my heart and

169
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,860
 Then tell me where we're gonna live what I'm gonna do

170
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,820
 How many kids we're gonna have where we're gonna go to church all of that

171
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,580
 Like I'm I don't I don't know what I'm do you ever feel this way just me. No, I'm kidding

172
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,560
 Some of you are shaking your head. No, I don't feel that way good. I'm glad I'm relevant. Okay, so

173
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,380
 Or even worse

174
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,420
 you live in fear that you that he will never come and

175
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,500
 your life will just pass you by and

176
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,620
 You'll just sit waiting like hey, what if God doesn't what if he's called me to singleness and I didn't know it and

177
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,740
 And so here's what I'm saying to you stop waiting

178
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,120
 Do you hear me start living your life

179
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,680
 Marriage is is an awesome thing. It's a great thing and it is completely okay to want marriage. God says it's a good thing

180
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,520
 It is not okay

181
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,920
 to need marriage

182
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,560
 It is not okay to be in a place where you

183
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:08,880
 absolutely need marriage and you live in fear of not getting married so that someone would come in your life and and because

184
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,080
 You are led by fear will lead you to terrible places like Samson has done here

185
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,840
 And so when your desire to be married materializes in discontentment

186
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,760
 You have fed an idol and it has grown to a terrible thing namely unhappiness

187
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,440
 or

188
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,160
 discontentment and

189
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,000
 So you're left living a vulnerable helpless life, which is completely unnecessary

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,320
 Because you can live God's desires for your life right now. I

191
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,760
 Mean you can begin to change the world right now. You can begin to live out the gospel right now

192
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,440
 You can begin to live God's calling on your life right now

193
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,340
 Not when Prince charming comes into the picture but completely right now

194
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,740
 And so what I want to tell you ladies is be careful what you're feeding your heart because your heart is an idol factory

195
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,240
 Meaning it's producing idols and when you feed those idols in your heart, they grow they get bigger and bigger and bigger

196
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,440
 And so this is why if you go to your Pinterest account and you have this, you know

197
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,720
 This file the wedding day, right?

198
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:21,320
 Okay, I would cancel that you have this this file called dream wedding or one of these days exclamation point, but

199
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:29,880
 Would you delete it that I'm assuming that's nervous laughter right now delete it

200
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:37,040
 Like if if all you're feeding your heart and this is a big one, okay, I want you to lean in on this ladies

201
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,800
 if you're feeding your heart romantic comedies

202
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,880
 If you if you love your favorite TV shows feed your discontentment, you know

203
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,920
 if everything

204
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,480
 That you're doing. I mean you kind of live that backstreet song

205
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,760
 I want it that way and so if that's if that's what you're if that's what you're doing everywhere you go

206
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,160
 Those are the things that consume your heart and your mind. Would you stop?

207
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,360
 Would you stop I?

208
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,240
 Mean like like what? What are you asking me to do? Like what am I not supposed to do that watch romantic comedies?

209
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,520
 I mean you really mean that I mean am I not supposed to watch TV? Are you is that what you're saying?

210
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,040
 Yeah

211
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,200
 That's literally what I'm saying

212
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,960
 Could you imagine your girlfriend calls you hey

213
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,240
 You want to go see the notebook of 27 dresses of single in Seattle sex in the city, whatever

214
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,120
 Now

215
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,960
 Why what's wrong with you why why not just doesn't do good things to my heart. Oh

216
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 It

217
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:43,200
 Doesn't do good things to my heart either I

218
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,960
 Mean unless it does

219
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,640
 Like some of you like now this stuff doesn't mess with my heart. You're lying

220
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,760
 No, it does be careful

221
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,160
 That's the angle. I mean these girls didn't even have that temptation

222
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,520
 Right. And so if you already have a subscription to bride magazine or you're reading these articles, right?

223
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,360
 Like just just watch out man

224
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,200
 You're feeding something and you're walking around you're just content and be careful audit the conversations

225
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,180
 You're having like if you guys get around as a community group and it's holy and it's good

226
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,720
 You got your Bible open and just like man, there's no good guy all the good guys. They don't like us girl

227
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
 They don't like good girls, you know

228
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,480
 And and you just kind of spinning that up and you're getting all angry and then all of a sudden it's like no

229
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,800
 They don't like you because you're the angry single girl, you know

230
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
 like

231
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,120
 Like be be careful. All right, like that's what it is. Like you you're getting all worked up. You're walking around

232
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,440
 It's like big chip on your shoulder like calm down

233
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,120
 Okay that you don't realize that conversation you keep having is

234
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,960
 feeding something

235
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,000
 Even under an umbrella of righteousness. Well, you know, we just we're just talking as girls. Yeah. Yeah, you're feeding something

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,560
 Be careful

237
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,360
 Be careful

238
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
 And so when you live in fear

239
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,640
 You forfeit your ability to make wise decisions

240
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,480
 think clearly and

241
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 Trust others that you should trust right like like Samson's parents for example, they come up and they like Samson. You don't want that girl

242
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,400
 Yes, I do

243
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,120
 You know me. Yeah, she's hot. You know, I want it's like no you don't say yes, I do

244
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,800
 And he's not listening to the wise counsel in his life

245
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:29,080
 Like I see this happen all the time that people isolate themselves. There's a reason we caught fish that second day

246
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,960
 We had an expert with us

247
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,080
 We had someone who had been there with us

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,800
 We had someone telling us where to go and how to navigate those waters and where to cast and where the fish were

249
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:46,320
 You've got to have this in your life. And I see it where where people they're like, oh, I love this community group

250
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,840
 They're amazing and I can trust them and then you start dating some guy or some girl and then they say hey

251
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,760
 I don't think he's any he's good for you. He's like, well, what do you know?

252
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,000
 I can't trust you, you know

253
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,760
 And he's just isolate yourself when you find yourself on an island where you've alienated yourself in the church

254
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,440
 Why because that feels like the church is holding something from you that you really really really want

255
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,520
 Be careful. I

256
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,240
 Trust myself the least when I really really really want something

257
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,000
 When we were out there fishing what the first day didn't catch any what we kept catching was crabs

258
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,200
 I promise this is not an inappropriate sex joke

259
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 I

260
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,040
 Kept catching crabs and

261
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,360
 I'm serious. Stay with me. Okay, and I'm going somewhere deep and theological with this

262
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,400
 And so we we cast and and I don't know what it's like to be a crab, you know sitting there in the ocean

263
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,960
 Like oh man, look at this fish just hanging out

264
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,120
 Launch, you know grab it and the interesting thing about reeling in a crab is they're not hooked

265
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,200
 Do you realize that they're not hooked on anything? They're just holding on so one minute

266
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,360
 He's like, oh fish take it and next minute. He's like, oh, I'm water skiing what's going on? And so

267
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,880
 And so I remember like this kept happening to me. I'm sitting there

268
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,000
 I'm reeling in and I'm looking in the beady eyes of this little crab who's just holding on for dear life

269
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,560
 And I'm like all you got to do is let it go buddy

270
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,400
 but you're about to be bait, you know, cuz that's what we would do is we take the crab and then make them bait for

271
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,280
 the fish and so

272
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,360
 They just kept coming in to death. All they had to do was let go

273
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,840
 But in the same way like some of you are stuck into a relationship being led by fear, well, I don't want to start over I

274
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,600
 Don't what do I know? I don't know what else is out there. What if there's nothing better out there?

275
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,000
 What if I in this and then I'm single the rest of my days and you're holding on to something out of fear

276
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,840
 When the girls will email me I'm like, well, how do I know?

277
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,400
 and I just I think he you know, and he seems like a good guy and he has a Bible and you know, and

278
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,040
 And I just don't know and I just don't know and about the sixth time they tell me they just don't know an email

279
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,120
 I just want to I want to respond with like just a few words like you do know, you know

280
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,400
 It's like it's it's very clear to me. You do know and that's why you're emailing me

281
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,040
 Because you want me to affirm that thing in the back of your heart that's telling you it this guy's not gonna marry you

282
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
 He's wasting your time

283
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,320
 And I'll do it I don't mind yeah, I get hate emails all the time guys are like you told my girlfriend

284
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,720
 It's let me just ask you a question before we go further

285
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
 What dating outcomes are you afraid of?

286
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,640
 That's a good question to tell your girls tell your community group what dating outcomes are you afraid of is it hurt?

287
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,560
 Is it not being asked out? Is it singleness?

288
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,200
 Is it divorce?

289
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,640
 Is it not liking marriage is it sex?

290
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,680
 Is it wasting time?

291
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,720
 Is it being the crazy cat lady? Like what what is the thing that you're afraid of?

292
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,760
 And so in this story it actually turns out come back with me

293
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,240
 It turns out that this woman's worst fears are realized

294
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,480
 Because she didn't bring them into the light if she would have just brought them into the light everything would have been fine

295
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,960
 But because she doesn't okay, they actually set her on fire. Here's what happens

296
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,880
 Is Samson is so angry that they've given his wife away to his companion that he sets their crops on fire

297
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,400
 They're so angry that he set their crops crops on fire that they set her and her father on fire

298
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,920
 Okay, and so then Samson goes into hiding and his own people the Israelites come and hand him over to the Philistines

299
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,840
 He's tied up with new ropes and they're there about to kill him and it says the Spirit of the Lord came on him

300
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,320
 His strength was there and he slayed the Philistines. He slayed the army that was in front of him

301
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,800
 He killed a thousand men. Okay, and I want you to remember this place is called Rameth Lehi

302
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,240
 That's gonna be important in a minute. Okay, and so he literally kills them and it says he's dying of thirst literally dying of thirst

303
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,080
 He cries out to God and God provides a spring we see God's mercy over and over and over again

304
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,760
 And then it says he leads the Israelites for 20 years. And so finally he's doing his job

305
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,640
 They're free from this Philistine oppression until

306
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,320
 he sees

307
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,120
 another woman

308
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,680
 Judges 16 one day Samson went to Gaza where he saw a prostitute

309
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,360
 He went in to spend the night with her

310
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
 The people of Gaza were told Samson is here

311
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
 So they surrounded the place and lay and wait for him all night at the city gate

312
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,320
 They made no move during the night saying at dawn will kill him

313
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,040
 My second point this evening is control causes us to get caught up in dating

314
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,960
 control

315
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,680
 Control a desire for control causes us to get caught up in dating now

316
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,760
 Why would I say control when we're talking about a prostitute and Samson, right? Here's why

317
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,760
 Because I've talked with enough women coming out of prostitution to understand. There's only one woman

318
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,320
 There's only one reason rather a woman uses her sexuality

319
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 to get a man

320
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,160
 One is because she's controlled by men and

321
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,280
 Two is because she wants to be in control of men

322
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,060
 There's only two reasons and they both include this word

323
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:18,120
 Control and so she's either under the control of a man or she desires control and realizes that she can do that with her sexuality

324
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,320
 and so women

325
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,800
 when you begin to use your

326
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:29,160
 Sexuality to control your destiny in dating you've moved outside the will of God

327
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,640
 Let me say that again

328
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:38,080
 When you begin to use your sexuality to control the outcome in dating you've moved outside

329
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,640
 the will of God

330
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,680
 That that is not our goal that is not God's best for you

331
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,680
 And so I just I will ask you is sex outside of marriage an option for you

332
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:02,520
 It's sex not outside of marriage an option for you and women will say when no, it's not even an option

333
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,680
 Are you on birth control? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh

334
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:14,920
 Why safety net I mean I get it like listen to be clear if it's complexion doctor prescribed regulate your period

335
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,280
 I get that but if you're on birth control

336
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,360
 Because well just in case

337
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,640
 What do you got a safety net?

338
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,680
 Let me ask you a question

339
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:32,240
 What would God have to do or say to you to move you to a place where you would say?

340
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,960
 Sex outside of marriage is not an option

341
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,120
 Like let's just say he shows up face to face with you he says hey, hey friend, I want you to flee sexual immorality

342
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,920
 Do you not know your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you?

343
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,640
 You've been bought by a price. You are not your own therefore honor God with your body

344
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,160
 What if he showed up to you and looked you in the eyes and he said hey

345
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,280
 I want you to keep the marriage bed pure and undefiled

346
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:04,520
 Would that be enough? I mean he said both of those things in case you wanted both of those

347
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,480
 And a whole lot of other things

348
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,400
 And so what would he have to do?

349
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,320
 Where you say he sex outside of marriage is not an option for me because he puts these rules in place

350
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,000
 Because he cares for you for your protection. He wants to protect you in ways that you can't even see it

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,200
 He desires a godly relationship for you, and he will not settle see God's bar is a healthy marriage

352
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,040
 He's like sweet princess

353
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,760
 sweet daughter of mine I

354
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,320
 love you and

355
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 I have something better for you

356
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,120
 And if you want to pursue

357
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,600
 Those things outside of my desires for you

358
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,760
 I will let you you have the freedom to do that

359
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,740
 But that's not my best for you and it's gonna hurt you and it's gonna pain me to watch you do that

360
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,480
 And you know what happens as girls do that they get to a place and they say why God?

361
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,000
 Why did you do this to me?

362
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,520
 He said no, I was up in my kingdom jumping up and down waving my arms saying don't go that way I was saying flee

363
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,200
 sexual immorality

364
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
 Because I love you

365
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,240
 And I want my very best for you, but you didn't listen to me

366
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,640
 Man you didn't listen to me

367
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,440
 You ran into that prostitutes house, and you were trapped and they waited outside to kill you

368
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,760
 Because it's a trap it's always a trap

369
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,040
 When we were fishing

370
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,480
 You know we wanted to catch two kinds of fish redfish and trout

371
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,120
 And the guide he he had this fish finder this thing where you could see what's swimming underneath and there was so many

372
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,600
 Fish underneath the boat I mean and there are these porpoise or these dolphins

373
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,440
 You know swimming around the boat is pretty amazing and there was shark there

374
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,760
 And there were jackfish there and there were hardheads there

375
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,520
 And there was this other kind of jack something fish Jack Clavel fish there

376
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,400
 There were all these kinds all these types of fish

377
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:19,400
 But we just wanted to catch redfish and trout and so what we did was we only used bait that redfish and trout

378
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,360
 will take

379
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,480
 We didn't use bait that the other fish would want the other fish would try to take and and so this is very simple

380
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:35,760
 It's very logical. It's very practical, and it will save you a lot of pain if you are fishing with your body

381
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,840
 If you are fishing with your low-cut blouse and your cleavage and your short skirt, right?

382
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,560
 I know you're 14 carats and all that but listen if you're using that to attract a man

383
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:56,080
 You're going to get someone that is going to only like you for your body now

384
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
 He's going to say amazing things to you

385
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,760
 You know you're a marquee diamond. He's going to say stuff like that to you

386
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,440
 He's going to look you in the eyes and whisper sweet nothings to you and tell you that you mean the world

387
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
 But really he means he loves your boobs

388
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,080
 Or you're behind

389
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,040
 Or your waistline or your tight shirt or your short skirt

390
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,360
 And I'm just I'm trying to in that so practical

391
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,320
 You're going to catch with whatever bait you use

392
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,120
 It's so practical

393
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:40,040
 This is one of the first things that changed in the wife in the life of my wife like we would we dated if you don't

394
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,640
 Know our story we dated as non-christians

395
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,360
 And then God came and just kind of dropped this bomb in our relationship

396
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,760
 And we both began to pursue him with reckless abandonment

397
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,400
 And I can remember dating Monica, and she would be so uncomfortable like

398
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,160
 unimaginably

399
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,800
 Uncomfortable at the lake in a one-piece like that would just be crazy to her like she'd be like man everybody been staring at

400
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,960
 Me because I got this one piece on you know and that just would be outside the realm of possibilities for her

401
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,720
 And then when the holy spirit came into her life likewise what changed was this really beautiful thing where she was just like I'm

402
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,080
 Uncomfortable and we got married. I'm uncomfortable

403
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,480
 Being in a place showing off my body like that to anybody, but you I would be so uncomfortable

404
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,680
 Being at the lake you wearing something that's equivalent to my underwear

405
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:35,560
 That's just outside the realm of possibilities. It was this beautiful thing that shifted in her as God just

406
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,040
 You know came in and consumed her life in her desires and her boundaries

407
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,400
 And I was so honored by that as her husband

408
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,480
 So honored by that

409
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,920
 Not not not at first like as a brand new green believer that still smelt and looked and taste

410
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,000
 I mean just reach of the world I

411
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,600
 Was like what are you doing? Hey show that off?

412
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,240
 Why are you doing that? Why are you covering up?

413
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,800
 But where that little spaghetti strap thing with the shelf bra where that like why not?

414
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:12,620
 And she's like no, I'm just being real guys. Okay. I'm just shooting you straight. That's all I know how to do okay

415
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,680
 And so and she's just like I'm not comfortable in that anymore

416
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,720
 God's changed who I am

417
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,800
 And now I look on that and with our two little girls. I'm like what a beautiful thing. What an incredible example for them

418
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,760
 What an amazing woman

419
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,160
 What an amazing examples. I know you're like, what am I supposed to do? You know?

420
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,680
 What am I supposed to walk around in a cardboard box? I can't help God made me curvy, you know

421
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,600
 What am I supposed to do? Okay angry single girl calm down. All right

422
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,840
 listen

423
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,240
 Listen, okay, you may have to get creative. I don't know if the less clothes or even cheaper

424
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,000
 You may have to spend more money. I don't know what you're gonna have to do, but it's okay. You can dress classy

425
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 You can do that

426
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,640
 now if you're at a place where you're like

427
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,240
 Well, I don't even believe in God and I'm not down with the Bible and when it says in first Peter 3 to dress modestly

428
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,920
 I reject that as true. That's okay. We're so glad you're here. You don't to feel weird. No one's staring at you

429
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,160
 No one's thinking well, she didn't dress very no you're in a safe place

430
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,080
 But if you're here and you follow Jesus

431
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,440
 Then dress like you follow Jesus. That's all I'm saying dress like a Christ follower

432
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:26,240
 And sexuality will allow you to control a relationship in ways that you should

433
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:34,920
 You can actually protect yourself from guys who chase sex by trusting in God's commands of modesty and celibacy

434
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:43,040
 And just to say this as I show you what I'm about to show you is using sex to get a guy

435
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,320
 Will actually cost you marriage

436
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,200
 Let me say that again, okay using sex to get a guy or using sexuality

437
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,440
 to get a guy may actually and most often does

438
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,680
 Cost you marriage you guys watch this

439
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:08,520
 Tell me we're getting better at this I

440
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:15,640
 Mean, I mean tell me that that from your grandparents generation. We we got this thing down divorce is going down marriage

441
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,240
 Marriage is happening earlier more often people are staying together. Tell me that we're getting better at this

442
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,920
 So tell me you know it all tell me he's wrong

443
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,520
 Tell me he doesn't love you. Tell me he doesn't have your best interest in mind

444
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,920
 Tell me that you've come up with some science. That's so much smarter than than God's Word

445
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,800
 And that you crack the code and and I know because you really love each other and it's gonna be amazing

446
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 He's gonna propose one day, you know

447
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,200
 And I know that you're gonna propose to him and you're gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna propose to him

448
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
 He's gonna propose one day, you know

449
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,560
 Tell me

450
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,040
 You can't tell me that

451
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,240
 It wouldn't be true we're getting so

452
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,640
 Terrible at this and and and what what grieves me

453
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:14,660
 Is it's it's not just the world. It's those of us saying yeah, we're following Christ. We're Jesus followers. We're not following Jesus

454
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,760
 following our hormones

455
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,000
 We're following our fears our control

456
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,640
 Following our desires

457
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,180
 We're left with technique. I mean love doesn't even have a role

458
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,780
 I mean guys some of you would rather marry an amazing prostitute

459
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,080
 Than an amazing mom

460
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,160
 Or an amazing caregiver

461
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,760
 Amazing woman who's gentle and kind

462
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
 You

463
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,360
 Know that's true left to your own devices, you know, that's true

464
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:59,920
 So Samson, you know God's mercy intervenes yet once again, and so he's sitting there. He's sleeping with this prostitute

465
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,180
 They aligned the place and he breaks out yet again

466
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:10,000
 He escapes not only does he escape but he takes the gates off their cities that estimates theologians estimate that these would have weighed

467
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,200
 700 pounds he runs 30 miles with them up to Mount Hebron and puts them on the top

468
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,280
 It's just this thing that he does to mock them saying hey, you're not safe. Your city is vulnerable to my strength

469
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,360
 But this really really strong man

470
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,240
 Is so weak in his willpower

471
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,160
 So weak in his willpower so strong so weak

472
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:41,560
 Verses 16 verse 5 sometime later then he fell in love

473
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:49,200
 With a woman in the valley of sorak whose name was Delilah the rulers of the Philistines went to her and said see if you

474
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,080
 Can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him

475
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,440
 So we may tie him up and subdue him each one of us will give you

476
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:08,480
 1100 shekels of silver now before you go hating on Delilah. This is the equivalent of 15 to 18 million dollars today

477
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,480
 I'm not saying she's a gold digger

478
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,600
 And

479
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,160
 So the first wife the woman of Timna was driven by fear what will happen if I don't?

480
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,040
 That the last wife Delilah is driven by desire. What will happen if I do?

481
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,480
 So my third point is desire causes us to get caught up in dating

482
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,240
 Desire causes us to get caught up in dating, right?

483
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,960
 If a healthy marriage is the goal a goal is not marriage

484
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,080
 The goal is not a man or a woman the goal is a healthy God honoring Christ centered marriage

485
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,320
 And so to define a healthy marriage, it's two selfish people

486
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,000
 being determined to act

487
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,080
 unselfish

488
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,760
 towards one another

489
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,440
 for a lifetime

490
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,660
 Just said otherwise, it's two selfish people because we're sinners selfish

491
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:06,240
 coming together in a covenant before God agreeing with him as your witness to be determined to

492
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,920
 everything within your power to yield to his spirit so that you might be selfless towards one another and

493
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,480
 So you're not driven by your desire

494
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
 You're not driven by your fear or your control see most

495
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,960
 People fail at this very very high call of being selfless towards one another, you know

496
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,160
 Selfishness is the only cause of divorce

497
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,000
 You show me a divorce I will show you someone acting selfishly

498
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,760
 Selfish people

499
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
 Make miserable spouses

500
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,920
 They can't live out the call of Ephesians 5 lay down your wife or your life for your wife

501
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,000
 Consider her more important than yourself

502
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,380
 Strive to live with her first Peter 3 in an understanding way

503
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,200
 Treating her fragile

504
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,880
 Delicate

505
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,040
 Gentle and so Delilah is driven by her desires for security and comfort. And so let me just ask you this question

506
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,720
 for you to think about

507
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,360
 Why do you or don't you want to be married?

508
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,880
 And I realize some of you feel right now the do and the don't I do want to be married and I don't want to

509
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,720
 Be married at the same time. So let me ask you in all sincerity. Why do you this is a great question

510
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,480
 To put in front of your community group. Why do you or don't you want to be married?

511
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,560
 Why do you or don't you want to be married

512
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:37,720
 Let me give you three good reasons to desire to be married

513
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,400
 Because God says it's good

514
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,120
 And so maybe that's why you say, you know what the reason I want to be married is because God says it's a good thing

515
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,120
 It's Genesis 2 18 and Proverbs 18 22

516
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,600
 Second reason because it's a unique opportunity to make disciples in your children through birth and adoption

517
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,440
 That's Proverbs 22 verse 6

518
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,640
 Deuteronomy 6 6 through 7 Ephesians 6 4 and Psalm 127 3 through 5 and

519
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,440
 Lastly because it is the picture of God's commitment to us

520
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,480
 Ephesians 5 32 and 33 in John 3 29

521
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,080
 These are good reasons to desire to be married

522
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,680
 There are selfless reasons to desire to be married

523
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,240
 A German Shepherd white picket fence

524
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,120
 control fear security

525
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,280
 not great reasons

526
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,040
 Verse 18 when Delilah saw that he had told her everything right he she goes through this whole thing of hey, you know

527
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,000
 Tell me he doesn't tell me he doesn't tell me he doesn't now he does he tells her everything

528
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,320
 She sent word to the rulers of the Philistines come back once more

529
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,840
 He has told me everything so the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands

530
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,840
 After putting him to sleep on her lap. Oh my goodness

531
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,800
 She called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair and so began to subdue him and his strength

532
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,960
 Left him it says then she called Samson the Philistines are upon you

533
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,960
 He awoke from his sleep and thought I'll go out as before and shake myself free

534
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,560
 But he did not know that what the Lord had left him enough Samson

535
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,560
 You've been disobedient. You have missed my call on your life enough

536
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,560
 Then the Philistines seized him gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza

537
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,560
 Binding him with bronze shackles. They set him to grinding grain in the prison

538
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,560
 But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved. What just a beautiful verse of God's mercy

539
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,560
 Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their God

540
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,560
 And to celebrate saying our God Dagon has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands

541
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,560
 While they were in high spirits. They shouted bring out Samson to entertain us. He's a clown now

542
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,560
 He's a clown. So they called Samson out of the prison and he performed for them

543
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,560
 Then they stood him among the pillars Samson said to the servant who held his hand put me where I can feel the pillars

544
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,560
 That support the temple so that I may lean against them

545
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:09,560
 Now the temple was crowded with men and women all the rulers of the Philistines were there the people that God said I want you to destroy

546
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:15,560
 And on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform

547
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:22,560
 Then Samson prayed to the Lord sovereign Lord remember me, please God strengthen me just once more

548
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,560
 And let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes

549
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,560
 Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood bracing himself against them

550
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,560
 His right hand on one and his left hand on the other Samson said let me die with the Philistines

551
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,560
 Then he pushed out with all his might and down came the temple on the rulers and the people in it

552
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,560
 Thus he killed many more when he died

553
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,560
 Then while he lived

554
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,560
 Let me jump to application and then I'll come back and cover what we just read

555
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,560
 Men I'm going to start with you

556
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,560
 Men you got to hear this okay I care about you I've got no other motive

557
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,560
 Then I care about you so listen Samson couldn't see until he was blind

558
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:24,560
 Remember he saw the hot girl remember he was attracted to the prostitute he saw her and he went to her and he went into her the Hebrew says

559
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,560
 And remember says he was in love with Delilah what was he in love with Delilah

560
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,560
 Track record she's hot

561
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,560
 And then they gouged out his eyes and for the first time he could see God's call on his life

562
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,560
 You be careful what your eyes lead you to

563
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,560
 You be careful what you're feeding your heart through your eyes man

564
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,560
 I know that a lot of you a great tragedy in the room as many of you are going to pass up women who would make amazing moms and amazing wives and you will pass them up for somebody with a banging body and about one year of good sex

565
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,560
 And then they gouged out his eyes and for the first time he could see God's call on his life

566
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,560
 You be careful what your eyes lead you to

567
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,560
 You be careful what you're feeding your heart through your eyes man

568
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,560
 I know that a lot of you a great tragedy in the room as many of you are going to pass up women who would make amazing moms and amazing wives and you will pass them up for somebody with a banging body and about one year of good sex

569
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,560
 And then it will be boring and that's the truth

570
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,560
 Let me go one more with you men

571
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,560
 You want them to help you with your problem you can help them with their fears even though that's their problem by simply being honest

572
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,560
 And anticipating their questions and being wise with what you say and what you do

573
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,560
 Knowing you are leading their heart with every text message late at night

574
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,560
 With everything that you say when you say I'm going to call you call her otherwise you're a liar

575
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,560
 So be careful what you say follow only speak what is honest and true building others up

576
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,560
 So that it might benefit those who listen

577
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,560
 Be careful with your words they're taking you somewhere and they're taking her heart somewhere

578
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,560
 And leaders remove confusion people ask me all the time what does it look like to lead in a relationship

579
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,560
 And I'm not saying that I'm not leading what she's wondering and speaking to it

580
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,560
 That's what great leaders do I wonder where she's confused and how can I address that confusion

581
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,560
 Can I get an amen ladies

582
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,560
 Samson was an awful leader he followed his desires he didn't lead in purity what does it look like to lead in a relationship

583
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,560
 If you think you're a good leader and you're not leading in purity I'll be right here afterwards

584
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,560
 Let's have a conversation I would love to have that conversation

585
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,560
 He didn't protect the woman he was involved with he's looking around like when we were fishing

586
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,560
 If we caught the wrong fish we throw it back and before we were done there's a bunch of dead fish floating around belly up

587
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,560
 It looks like Samson's life every woman he's dated is left in tragedy dead

588
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,560
 In bad places he's using and abusing people

589
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,560
 If you're not leading well in relationships he played games

590
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,560
 And so ladies let me talk to you for a second I want you to confess your fears

591
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,560
 And ask the Lord to protect you and to help you take thoughts captive

592
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,560
 And don't feed thoughts of discontentment with what you watch or talk about

593
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,560
 You begin to take those thoughts captive every time you begin to start wondering

594
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,560
 Will I have lace will I have beads what will my bridesmaids wear thoughts captive

595
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:04,560
 It's okay to want to be married it's not okay to need to be married and begin to feed that idle factory that's not okay

596
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,560
 And ladies you are not waiting to get married you're actively pursuing Christ

597
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:18,560
 And there is no better time to pursue a healthy marriage to him to Jesus a right relationship with Christ

598
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,560
 Some of you here you want to be married so badly but you don't know the word you don't know the Bible

599
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,560
 You've been discipled you're not discipling others I mean honestly your faith has very little implication on your life

600
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:38,560
 And there's no better time like the present than to change that and so then lastly men and women don't go at this alone

601
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,560
 Point your friends in the right direction and they may hate you okay but don't go at this dating thing alone

602
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,560
 Help each other out speak truth to one another

603
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,560
 I want to show you something awesome we're going to wrap up with Samson this is just it's just incredible see life

604
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:03,560
 I showed you before like this book it's it's so much more about marriage all the marriages it's just a couple pages maybe five pages total out of all of these pages

605
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:11,560
 Because this book is about another relationship you're living in a narrative listen closely you're living in a narrative that's another relationship

606
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:19,560
 That's the ultimate relationship it's why you're breathing it's why you're alive this is why you're here this other relationship that you would right now today before you leave here

607
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,560
 Be rightfully married in right relationship with Jesus Christ who gave his life for you

608
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:32,560
 And so we look at Samson and God says hey I want you to you're gonna be born to save my people but he was an imperfect Savior

609
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:39,560
 He was an imperfect Savior if you go after Samson if you chase Samson he's gonna leave you wanting and hurting and desperate

610
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:45,560
 He's an imperfect Savior but he points his life points to a perfect one can I show you something beautiful

611
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:52,560
 An angel the Lord shows up to a woman and says you will have a son who will be set apart who's gonna set these people free

612
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:01,560
 Later that angel tells her husband an angel comes to Mary the mother of Jesus and says hey you're gonna have a son

613
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,560
 His name will be Jesus and he's gonna set the people free from oppression and sin

614
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:17,560
 And later that angel the Lord goes to her husband Joseph and says hey your wife's gonna be with child and it's gonna be special

615
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:28,560
 Samson was born to set God's people free from the rule of evil in the land Jesus came to set us free from sin and death

616
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,560
 Samson was betrayed by his own people and handed over to his enemies

617
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,560
 And Jesus was betrayed by his own people and handed over to his enemies

618
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:46,560
 Samson slayed a thousand Philistines at Rameth Lehi in the Hebrew it's Jawbone Hill

619
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,560
 In Greek it's Galgotha in Latin it's Calvary

620
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:59,560
 Jesus went to the hill of the skull and slayed evil once and for all saying it is finished

621
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:09,560
 And Samson was thirsty and as Jesus hung on the cross in John 19 verse 28 he said I am thirsty

622
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,560
 Samson tore down the barrier of God's enemies showing them vulnerable to his strength

623
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:25,560
 And through the death of Jesus Christ God tore the veil in two saying there is now no barrier between you and me we can have right relationship

624
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,560
 Delilah betrayed Samson for 11,000 shekels of silver

625
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:41,560
 From each person Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver

626
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:48,560
 And in one act of vengeance with evil present Samson stretched out his right and left hand

627
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:56,560
 Sacrificing his own life to set God's people free from the oppression of evil in the land

628
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:07,560
 And in one moment Jesus without stretched hands died for your lust and your control and your fear

629
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:14,560
 And the fact that you've done this wrong and you can't get it right

630
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:20,560
 Because you're fearful instead of trusting him you're controlling instead of surrendering to him

631
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:26,560
 You've been driven by your desires instead of his you've searched outside his people

632
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:35,560
 And you played games with the hearts of his children and so if you've heard anything you're like man he's talking about me

633
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,560
 Christ died for that that's the beautiful message of the gospel

634
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,560
 And this life is not about marriage it's about Jesus it's not about finding Mr. Right

635
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:50,560
 It's about living in right relationship with Christ it's not about the white picket fence in Frisco

636
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,560
 It's about being in right relationship with Jesus and knowing his desires for your life

637
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,560
 Because you're gonna go and be there forever and there's no husband there's no marriage in heaven did you know that?

638
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,560
 Nobody's married in heaven not one person is up there married except for the church

639
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,560
 God's people married to their bridegroom Jesus Christ that's it

640
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,560
 That's it

641
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:22,560
 Don't you see there's another narrative that's so much more important than the narrative that you've been pursuing with everything

642
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:29,560
 And he loves you and he's calling you right now he's like man I know you got some gifts and some talents and some game

643
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,560
 And I know you've royally screwed this up my words not his but I died for that

644
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:45,560
 And I love you so much my arms outstretched on the cross I love you so much

645
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:54,560
 And I've given my life and I did so purposefully and intentionally because you didn't get it right

646
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,560
 And I don't even hold that against you if you trust in that payment

647
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:12,560
 And I've defeated death so you have a promise that you can be with God the father in his kingdom forever and ever and ever

648
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,560
 Let me pray that you would

649
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
 King Jesus

650
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:34,560
 Father whom we can talk to only because of the blood of your son Jesus

651
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:46,560
 Father we confess our sins to you we've pursued pornography we've pursued prostitution in the way that we date

652
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:55,560
 We've not cared for your children we've not protected hearts God we've chased our feelings we've given in to our lustful desires

653
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:00,560
 Father we've sat in discontentment looking at our lives and wanting the life of another

654
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:08,560
 Wanting the significant other of another wanting someone else's boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, children

655
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,560
 Wanting something else than what we have God we have lived discontentment

656
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,560
 We have loved men more than Jesus women more than Jesus

657
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:23,560
 We've loved magazines, articles, movies, shows, the temptations of our flesh more than Christ

658
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,560
 Thank God we repent

659
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:32,560
 Father capture our hearts and our minds and turn them back to our first love

660
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:40,560
 That we would spend every second of the rest of our life running with reckless abandonment after you

661
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:49,560
 Pursuing you in ministry learning your word writing it on our hearts being disciples making disciples

662
00:53:49,560 --> 00:54:01,560
 Being connected to the church contributing using every gift and talent we have to lift up the name of Jesus

663
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,560
 Thank you for Jesus

664
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,560
 Thank you that we don't have to pay for our sins

665
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,560
 Thank you that you paid for our sins

666
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,560
 It's in his precious name

667
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,560
 Amen

668
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,560
 I know you have

669
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,560
 I missed it too

670
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,560
 Man I messed the thing up real bad

671
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,560
 I just listened to the world

672
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:39,560
 Love movies, TV, shows, love dating

673
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,560
 Love the thrill

674
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,560
 What I could get someone to do

675
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,560
 Love the feeling of newness

676
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,560
 Love the wondering honestly in some sick kind of way

677
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,560
 Wondering if I'd ever get married or if anyone would ever love me enough in that way

678
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,560
 All the while I was already loved

679
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,560
 All the while that's a secondary narrative

680
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,560
 To a bigger story that I was called to live a part of

681
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,560
 Let me address the elephant in the room

682
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
 I'm a married guy

683
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
 I'm married

684
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,560
 I get it

685
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,560
 You're married

686
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,560
 Just do it

687
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,560
 If something happened to Monica I don't know

688
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,560
 I don't know what I would do

689
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,560
 I have no idea

690
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,560
 But I know that I would want to pursue God with reckless abandonment

691
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,560
 I know that I would find

692
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:37,560
 If I chose to get married again I would find the godliest woman I could

693
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:43,560
 And I would ask her if I wanted to get married to spend the rest of my life with me

694
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,560
 And right now through God's grace and mercy

695
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,560
 He's given me the godliest woman I know

696
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
 But he did that in his grace and mercy

697
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:56,560
 It's a poor strategy not one that you can replicate

698
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
 I want to help you

699
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,560
 We want to help you

700
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,560
 But you've got to understand

701
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,560
 We're just going to point you to the source of truth

702
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,560
 And I get so excited and so amped

703
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,560
 When I look out there and I see thousands of you

704
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,560
 And I just think, man, if they just got this right

705
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,560
 And put their selfish desires aside

706
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,560
 And begin to pursue God's desires for each other

707
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,560
 How amazing and powerful

708
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,560
 I mean there would be revival

709
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
 There would be great awakening

710
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,560
 Disciples would be made in the home

711
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,560
 Christianity would spread like wildfire

712
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,560
 The world would be saved

713
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,560
 And Jesus would come back home

714
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
 To a new heaven

715
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,560
 One you helped to create

716
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,560
 Because you understood your purpose and your mission

717
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,560
 And so there's going to be a lot of folks moving around with red shirts on

718
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,560
 And if we can pray for you, listen to you, help you

719
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
 We would love to do that

720
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
 If you're looking for community

721
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,560
 You're like, man, I have no guide

722
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,560
 I have no person to help me know or hold me accountable

723
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,560
 Guys, you walk down this hallway

724
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,560
 There'll be a room full of guys in there

725
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,560
 If you've wondered if you should ever go in there

726
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
 Tonight's your night, you go in there

727
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,560
 Girls, you walk down this hallway

728
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,560
 There'll be a room full of girls there

729
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,560
 If you've ever wondered, man, should I go in there?

730
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,560
 That could be weird, there's a bunch of girls

731
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,560
 Do they know?

732
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,560
 Listen, there's a bunch of girls in there

733
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,560
 Looking for the same thing you're looking for

734
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,560
 Walk in there, it won't be a big deal

735
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,560
 It won't be scary, nothing

736
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,560
 Go check it out

737
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,560
 If we can serve you in any way

738
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,560
 We're willing and ready

739
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,560
 I love you guys so much

740
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,560
 Go in peace, to love and serve the Lord
