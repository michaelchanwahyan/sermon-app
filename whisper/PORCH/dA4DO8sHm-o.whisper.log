[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   You, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   [Music]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Some of the band is going to stay up here because we're going to do something a little bit different tonight.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   But just as we were thinking through election day and preparing for, you know, kind of an unusual evening,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   there's a story that I was reminded of from God's Word.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   It's a story that's found in Joshua, chapter 3, and it's one of those stories that is such a reminder in Joshua and the people of God.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I'll explain even kind of the context for the book of Joshua.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   One of those moments where they were reminded, when things feel out of control and chaotic, remember, remember who your God is.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Remember that He's at work when you can't see it and you can't connect the dots.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Remember, everything in this world full of brokenness is still in His hands.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   If you're familiar with the book of Joshua, Old Testament is about the nation of Israel and God's relationship with the nation of Israel.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   God shows up in the book of Genesis to a guy named Abraham.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Father Abraham had many sons.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   God shows up, says, "I'm going to make a great nation out of you, the nation of Israel."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Abraham has these 12 sons, and over and over -- or Abraham has one son.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   He has a son that has many, many sons.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And God builds this incredible nation, and He grows this people group.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   They find themselves in Egypt, and they're enslaved for 400 years.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And God had promised, "I'm going to build this great nation.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   You're going to have just this promised land that I'm going to give you."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And 400 years go by, and a lot of the Jewish people are going, "Maybe God has forgotten us."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   I'm looking around, and all I know is slavery.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   All I know is being oppressed.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It doesn't seem like we're the chosen people of God.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And if we are, I'm not even sure I want to be the chosen people of God.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And then a baby boy named Moses is born.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Moses grows up, and God says, "You're going to leave my people out of bondage."
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Moses goes. You may have seen the movie, "The Prince of Egypt."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   He goes to Pharaoh and says, "Let my people go."
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Eventually, after a handful of plagues, the people of Israel are free.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's one thing to be free, but they don't have any place to go to.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They're a nation of a wandering people group.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   They don't have a land.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And because of decisions that they made in ways they didn't trust God,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   they wandered in the desert for 40 years, waiting to be brought into this promised destination.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   God said, "I have a place for the people of God."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And Moses is like George Washington to the nation of Israel.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I mean, he's the guy who set them free.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   He's the guy that founded the nation.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He's the guy that gave them the law.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And they get up to the edge of the promised land.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   They're about to enter in. They've been waiting years and years.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Their great-great-great-great-great-grandparents have been waiting for this day.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They get up to the promised land edge, and God says, "Moses, you're not going in.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Your time is done."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And Moses passes away.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And God says, "Joshua, you are going to lead the people of God."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Now, to us, we're like, "Oh, we get the story. Moses was cool and Joshua was cool."
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This would have been huge shoes to fill.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You're filling in for the George Washington/Abraham Lincoln combo,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   the guy who would strike a--with his staff, a rock, and water would come out.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   He parted the ocean.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   God threw him, parted the ocean with his staff.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I mean, those are big shoes to fill.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   If you're filling in for a guy who can tap rocks and make water come out, it's not an easy game.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And Joshua is told that he's going to lead the people of Israel.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And the nation is going, "Are we sure, God? We're almost in.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Like, just let Moses take us in."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And God says, "Joshua is going to take you into the Promised Land."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And he gives him an order.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   He says, "Joshua, I want you to take the people,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   and I want you to walk up to the edge of this river that was separating them from going into the Promised Land."
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And the story that we're about to read, it reflects those moments of what you do.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   The reminder, Joshua is about to get in the people of Israel,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   God, that God is always in control.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   He's always at work.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And every little turn in the story is meant to point us to him.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So Joshua is told, "Hey, I've got to get two million people,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and I want you to take them up to this river's edge called Jordan.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And on the other side of the river is the Promised Land.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You guys could march a long, long way around and not have to go through that,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   but I want you to walk right up to the river's edge,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and I want you to look at the land that I'm about to give you."
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So Joshua goes, and he tells the people we're about to go to the river's edge,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   and then God gives him another command.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And here's what he says in Joshua chapter 3, verse 8.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "Give this command, Joshua, to the priests, those who carry the Ark of the Covenant."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The Ark of the Covenant doesn't mean a lot to us.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   The Ark of the Covenant would have been the visible representation of God's presence to the nation of Israel.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The most valuable thing they had.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They held the Ten Commandments in there.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   The most valuable thing that they had, and it represented,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   "Hey, God who exists is on our side. He's with us. His presence is here."
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   The most valuable thing we have.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And God says, "I want you to tell the priests to take the Ark of the Covenant,"
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   which is this big piece of wood or wooden box, if you will,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   "and when they reach the banks of the Jordan River,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   take a few steps into the river and stop there."
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Joshua gives this instruction, and the priests must have thought,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "Wait a second. What? The new guy in charge is telling us to take the most valuable thing that we have
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   and step into, as we're about to see, a rushing river with it?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   A river that we can't possibly swim across or even get across,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and you want us to begin to walk out in the water?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   What in the world?"
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   But Joshua gives them the command.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   This is what God said to do.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Verse 14, "So the people left their camp to cross the Jordan River,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   and the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant, they went ahead of them.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It was harvest season."
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Your translation may say, "It was flood season."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   "And the Jordan was overflowing at its banks."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   The Jordan River. Here's a map of the Jordan River, just so you can kind of see what's going on.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The people of God have been told, "Hey, we're going to cross over the Jordan River.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   At the very bottom of it is the Dead Sea, and there's somewhere right near the city of Jericho,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and they're on this side."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And God says, "All the land to the left of the Jordan River is going to be yours,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and you're going to cross over it."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But they come during the worst time of the year to come.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   God says, "You guys have been wandering for 40 years, and I want you right now
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   to go prepare to cross over the Jordan River."
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Why do I say it's the worst time? Because it was during harvest season.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   What does the river look like during harvest season?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Here's a picture of today, during the flood season or harvest season,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   where it is a rushing water, rushing more than 10 miles an hour.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It swells from 50 feet wide to 150 feet wide.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   It's impossible to touch the ground.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It just overflows during this one small window a year.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And God, it's not like he needed to go during that time.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   They've been wandering 40 years, and God says, "Right now,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I want you to bring the people and take a few steps into the water
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and tell the archer or tell the priest to move in to the Jordan River."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And here's what happens.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   "As soon as the feet of the priests who are carrying the ark
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   touch the water's edge,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the water above that point began backing up
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   a great distance away at a town called Adam."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   We can't find, side note, Adam on a map today.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   The only way we know it is because of the reference to the city it's by,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   which is near Zarethan.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But the source of the water was coming from this town called Adam.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   "And as soon as the priest stepped in,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   it began to be dried up at the source of the water.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   At that point, the water that was below flowed on to the Dead Sea
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   until it was just the riverbed."
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   This was not like the dividing water of parting the Red Sea,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   if you're familiar with that, where Moses goes up and says, "Divide the water."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   This was a moment where it would be like similar to letting the water out of a bathtub,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   where just in a moment, priests step in.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   They begin to see, "I think some of the water is coming out."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   In other words, it stopped miles away.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Some scholars estimate it would have taken two hours
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   where the priests of the Ark of the Covenant are just standing there,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   thinking like they're holding something that would have looked almost like a coffin,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   or people bearing a coffin at his funeral.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And they're standing there for two hours, and they watch the water.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And Joshua's sitting there, newly elected leader, going,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "Man, I hope this works.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I really hope that was God talking.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I don't know if that's the devil telling me to tell them to take the Ark of the Covenant
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   into the riverbed."
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And slowly but surely, the water dissipates.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Then all of the people, two million of them,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   crossed over near the town of Jericho.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Lord's Covenant
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   stood on dry ground in the middle of the riverbed as the people passed by.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   They waited there until the whole nation of Israel had crossed by
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   on the Jordan, on dry ground.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So the nation, one by one, walk across
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   and are able to cross the thing that was keeping them
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   out of entering into God's promised destination for them.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   The barrier is stopped because the Ark, this wooden box,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   containing, symbolizing the presence of God,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   allows the barrier to be removed.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And one by one, they walk over.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And what happens next, we don't have time to go into,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   but it's such a beautiful story.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   In Joshua chapter 4, they all get over to the other side.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   They're about to be in the promised land.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   And God says, "I want you to remember
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   what I've done for you this day and what I do in general.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   While the riverbed's still dry, I want you to take 12 big, strong guys,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   the guys you put on the football team, Joshua,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   take those guys, tell them to go get 12 huge stones
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   out of the riverbed and pick them up.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And on the side where the promised land you're about to enter is,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I want you to build a 12-stone monument.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And here's why I want you to build it."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It's so fascinating.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   "I want you to put them and stack them up together
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   so that every time you and your children,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   and your children's children, walk by those stones and they go,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   'That's kind of funny. Like, why are there 12 random rocks there?'
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   You tell them of what I did for you this day.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   That your God provides, your God makes a way,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   your God is the one you trust in, not yourself,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   not your circumstances."
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And they build this memorial.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And then after that, the nation goes and they begin to make camp.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They begin to set up campfires and they're putting their tents out
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   and you've got millions of people, as far as you can see.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   There's camels and there's horses and people,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and they're setting up their kids and they're getting used to, like,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   this is going to be where we're eventually going to live.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And Joshua is taking the whole thing in.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   He's still a little uncertain over what's going to happen next,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   so he decides, "Man, I'm going to go scout out the land.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I just want to make sure there's no enemies nearby.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I want to go see what's kind of around us."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And we're told that he leaves the camp.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   In Joshua 5, verse 13, it says,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   "When Joshua was near the town of Jericho,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   he looked up and he saw a man standing right in front of him
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   with his sword and hand drawn.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Joshua went up to him and he demanded, 'Are you a friend or a foe?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Are you with us or against us?'
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The man replied, 'Neither one.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I am the commander of the Lord's army.'
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   At this, Joshua fell on his face to the ground in reverence.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   'I am at your command,' Joshua said.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   'What do you want your servant to do?'
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The commander of the Lord's army replied, 'Take off your sandals,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   for the place that you're standing is holy.'
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Joshua did as he was told."
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The commander of the Lord's army,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   scholars have pointed out for years and years,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   that most likely is the pre-incarnate Christ.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   It's basically Jesus before Jesus came and lived on this planet.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That it is the commander, it is the one, the ruler
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   of the Lord's army in heaven
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   and the ruler of this world.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And Joshua is looking face to face
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   with the angel of the Lord.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   The angel of the Lord says, "Take off your sandals."
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I mean, when you read that, you're like, "That's kind of a funny thing.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   He's on holy ground because he's in the presence of God."
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   The angel, the commander, if you will, begins to explain,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   "Hey, here's what you're going to do.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   You're going to go," and he gives him basically the marching orders,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "You're going to take down the city of Jericho.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   This is the land I've promised you.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And you're going to go march around it."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   You're familiar with that story, you've heard,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   but they go out and they bring the marching band
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   and they march around the city of Jericho
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and the wall's top of them.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And Joshua was reminded in that moment, out, just him,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   looking at whatever that commander looked like.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Joshua, you think you're in control,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   but there's ultimately one who is higher in authority than you.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And you may be the commander of things down here,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   but there is a commander of all things under who you fall,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   under whose authority you live.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   He's the one who's over all authority at all times,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   in all places, and everywhere, and you can trust.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And ultimately, he's in command of the circumstances
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   and of the people and of the leaders in this world.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And Joshua learned the lesson that day.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   He also learned that God has invited us in every circumstance
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   that we are to trust in him,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   not to put our trust in our ability
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   and what we hope could happen
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and what we and some other friends think could happen,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   but to put our trust in him,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   not in our giftings or our job or our health,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   to put our trust in him.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Why would you tell them to come up to the riverbank,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   to come up to the Jordan River during the worst time possible?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Other times you could possibly jump on top of a horse,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   you could swim across,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   you could do something to get the people across,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   and you tell them to come up to the riverbank's edge
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   in the midst of the single time during the year
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   where it would be impossible to cross,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   unless you're involved, God.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Because what he wanted to communicate to Joshua
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and to the people of Israel, and to me, and to you,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   is he's inviting you to live this life,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   not trusting in your circumstances or yourself.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   That is a recipe for continually being disappointed,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   depressed, finding despair,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   but put your confidence in my ability to provide.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Trust what I tell you to do,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   and you'll experience my provision, my protection,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   and the path towards the life that you want.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   But you've got to trust and you've got to surrender to me,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   and you've got to say, "God, if you say it,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   "what I'm going to do, I'm going to do it.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   "No matter when things look crazy around me,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   "I'm going to trust in what you say
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   "and what you've done and who you are."
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And Joshua learned that day.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   This is why some people, when they walk through life,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   the more they grow in their faith and their trust in God,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   it's like the more, no matter what they face,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   they have this incredible peace that marks them.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   They can face the worst layoff of all time,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   and they trust God, and they're like, "God is good.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   "I don't like this, but he's in control,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   "and you know what, I trust him."
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And then there's other people
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   facing the exact same thing and they're freaking out.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I went this past Friday, and we went on a double date,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   my wife and I and some longtime close friends of ours,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and we went to Six Flags.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   My wife's like, "Happy place is Six Flags."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   She is one of those funny people who is like
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   so risk-averse in everything in life,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   except for like the worst of all times rollercoaster.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   She's like, "Yes, this is the greatest."
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And so we went to Six Flags, and it was Fright Fest,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which if you're not from Dallas,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   even if you are from Dallas, it's a trip.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   And so we're there, we're at Six Flags.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's like a fog machine overdose,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and we're getting ready to go on the rollercoaster rides,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   and my wife is just freaking out.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   She's like, "Yes, let's go on the Superman, the crazy one,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   "and then the Batman, Joker," and she just like loves it.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   And I'm with one of my close friends
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   who is like the entire, totally opposite.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Like he's like, "I don't know if we should do that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   "I'm gonna go get like a funnel cake or something."
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And he's like looking at the ride, and he's like,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   "Look, there's like a 16-year-old kid
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   "switching the button over here.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   "And look, they've been closed six months.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   "Who's done the maintenance on this stuff?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   "Why would I even wanna pay to be freaked out right now?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   "I could have a heart attack."
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And just the contrast between the two of them
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   could not be any different where I'm like,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   "Yo, bro, I mean, there's like a five-year-old
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   "in front of us in line.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   "I think you're gonna be okay."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And he's like, "I just, you know, it's not my thing."
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   And the entire time, even on the ride,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   where my wife is like, "It's so funny."
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And apparently this is like a thing, you know,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I guess among people, but certainly among women
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   wired like my wife where they're like,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   "No risk, but yes!"
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Freaking out, hands up in the air.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   And that was her, but on the same ride,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   he was like, "Oh, no, no, no!
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   "I'm freaking out!"
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   They were in the same circumstance.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   They were literally sitting two feet apart,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   experiencing the exact same rush,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   the exact same speed, exact same velocity,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   exact same turns, exact thing, everything.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   One of them is totally at peace,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   and one of them is freaking out.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   What's the difference?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   One of them trusts the roller coaster.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   One of them trusts those who are behind
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and those who put together
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   and those who created the roller coaster.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   They trust the ride, and the other one doesn't.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   This is why people can walk through
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   horrific circumstances.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Many in this room that are representative,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   people walking through, and it's like,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   "I found out at 34 I've got breast cancer."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Or somebody who finds out at 27,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   "Hey, I've got a now autoimmune disease
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   "that's gonna impact me for the rest of my life,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   "or I just lost my job from COVID.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   "Everything that I've been saving up for is all gone."
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   But in that place,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   despite the circumstances being terrible,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   they go, "God's got a plan, and I trust Him."
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   "And He's gonna bring good about from this,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   "and I don't like it, and I wouldn't have chose this,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   "but I trust Him.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "I really believe He exists.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   "He's real.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "He's at work, and I trust Him."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And then somebody in that exact same circumstance,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and they're walking through,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   and things aren't going the way that they want,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   and they just collapse.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Their faith falls apart.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   What's the difference between those two people?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   On the turns and flips of life,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   one of them trusts the one who's behind all the movements,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   and one of them doesn't.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And Joshua's message that he received
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   could not have been more clear.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Joshua, look at me.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I don't want you.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I don't want the people.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I don't want anyone to trust in you
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   or to trust in Moses
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   or to trust in anything that you can do.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I want you to trust in me,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   not in your leader, not in your abilities,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   not in how well you can speak,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   not in how well things are going,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   or how terrible.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I want, look at me, Joshua.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Trust in me.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And that message rang loudly to the nation that day.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   And we live in a world where we are constantly,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   even as Christians, being told to put our trust
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   in something else.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And the message over and over in Scripture is,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   hey, no matter what happens,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   you do not have to fear the terror of the night,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   as Psalm 91 says.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You are to trust in me.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Put your confidence.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I got it.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I'm in control.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   No matter what happens, no matter what you face,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   listen to me, I got you.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   You can trust me.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Trust what I've said in my word.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Do these things.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   I don't let you down.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   When you live obediently to me,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   you're going to see it was worth it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It was better.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   You can trust me.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And no matter what happens in an election day,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   at a local level, at a state level,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   at a national level, any of those things,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   God is in control.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   No one sits in the White House who ordains
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   or is over all things.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   That is a role uniquely taken by God.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   And there's a leader for every national leader,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   and Joshua that day looked him eye to eye.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And let me be clear, one day,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   you're going to see him eye to eye.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   You're going to see the ultimate leader,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   the King of Kings, the leader of leaders,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   whose name is Jesus, who in Revelation,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   you're going to see him eye to eye,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and it says his eyes are like fire.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And all people will see.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   There is only one name.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   There's only one leader.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   There's only one person worthy of your worship,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   of living obediently to,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   and following and trusting with your life,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and his name is Jesus.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Joshua, whose name, oddly enough, means Jesus.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   I mean, Yeshua is the Hebrew name for Jesus.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Yeshua is the Hebrew name for Joshua.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Joshua saw it that day.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And we've been invited as a people of God,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   no matter what's going on,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and I know no matter who wins an election tonight,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   there's going to be a lot of people upset,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   a lot of people hurt, a lot of people confused,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   or sad, or any of those things.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   God has said, "Don't put your confidence in man.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Put it in me.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   You can trust me."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   The hope for Christians
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   is ultimately in the one
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   who's over command of every heart in a second.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   God could save, if Joe Biden wins,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   God can save and awaken,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   if he hasn't had a relationship with Jesus,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   in a moment, he can make every single senator,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   every single president, every single mayor,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   every single governor,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   all of them radically followers of Jesus.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And shame on me,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   or shame on anyone who doesn't fully believe that
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   and have faith that that can happen.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   In a moment, he could do the same thing with Donald Trump,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   he could make him, in a moment, say,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   "I'm going to radically capture your heart,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and you're going to surrender to me,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   and you will not be a ruler of this land
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   who's not ruled by me in your heart."
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And he can do that.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And as people of God, we've been reminded,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   we have access to the one who's in command of all things,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   and we can rest there.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I love that he didn't say, "I'm on your side."
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   I mean, he's talking the nation of Israel.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   If anybody, Joshua, should be like,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   "Hey, are you on our side or are you on their side?"
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And he's like, "Look, I'm not on either side.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You need to wonder if you're on my side."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   That's what he says.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Tony Evans said such a great line,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   that, look, as a reflection of this,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and this, you know, essentially being Jesus in the text,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   that, hey, Jesus didn't come to take sides,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   he came to take over, and he's going to take over.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   So you don't need to worry if he's on your side,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   if he's on the side of Republicans,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   if he's on the side of Democrats.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   You need to make sure you are on his side.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   And you think through the lens of what is God's side
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   as it relates to policies and issues and all that stuff,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   all of which is important, but the question is not,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   he's not here to take a side, he is here to take over,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   and we as the people of God need to make sure,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   man, I want to be on his side.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And what he cares about, I care about.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Ultimately, the story of Joshua
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and the people crossing over the Jordan River
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   doesn't just, in the text, point to, like,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   how God is the leader of leaders.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   It points to the text, how this story is about something
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   so much bigger and so much more important,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   and I'm about to close down,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   and we're going to have a chance to pray.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   This story is about, almost like no other story
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   in the Old Testament that I know,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   in every turn points to Jesus.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   It's shocking.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And if you read back through it and you think about it,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   almost in every way imaginable, you see the fingerprints.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   This story, the entire time, it was all pointing to Jesus.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   It's all pointing to him.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   You have a leader named Yeshua,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   which is the Hebrew name for Jesus.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   If Joshua lived and Jesus lived in the Greek translation,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   it would have been Jesus.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And this man shows up, and God says,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   I'm going to have you be the one through whom
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   the people of God are able to enter into
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   the promised destination that I have for them.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Much like us being promised that through the leader of Jesus
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   we could enter into eternity, Joshua,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   you're going to, through you, be the person
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   who allows them to enter into the promised land of God.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And how are you going to do it?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Through a piece of wood.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   The separation from the people of God
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and the promised destination of God.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   The separating barrier will be overcome by a piece of wood,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   and that wood is going to stop that barrier
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   all the way back to its source, Adam.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Much like the people of God,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   by trusting in Jesus Christ and the work he did
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   on a piece of wood called a cross,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   where he was crucified, and he was killed
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   for your sin and my sin, and by trusting in that,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   the barrier of the separation from us and eternal life
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   through that piece of wood is no longer
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   something that keeps or has to keep
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   anyone from having eternally
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   the ability to spend life with God.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And he's going to cut it off
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   all the way back to its source, Adam.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   The Bible says it's sin, and everything sinful
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   and broken in our world comes from the source
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   of Adam and Eve and the garden, all of that sin.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   It's all been tracing.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And Jesus shows up, and through the work that he did,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   through a piece of wood, stops all of it back
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   all the way to the source.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   He pays for every sin everywhere,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   and he removes the barrier so the people of God
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   don't have to be separated from him.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And every turn, it points to Jesus.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   The one who told Joshua that day,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   "Take your sandals off. You stand on holy ground."
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And let me be abundantly clear.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   All of life points to Jesus,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   or it's Jesus' attempt, it's God's attempt,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   no matter what you're walking through,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   and as challenging as it is,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   for you to have his attention,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   or for God to get your attention,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   to look to him.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Then no matter what you are walking through,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   trust in me.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Trust in me.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And in every page, in every turn,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   all throughout the story, it's clear to see,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   it was always pointing to him,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   the God who, through a piece of wood,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   and a leader named Yeshua, or Jesus,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   would make a way for the people of God
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   to enter into the rest,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and ultimately, to enter into eternity with him.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Our confidence as Christians
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   has nothing to do with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   which is where the White House is.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Our hope and our confidence has everything to do
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   with a cross and a crucifixion
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   that happened right outside of the Jerusalem walls
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   2,000 years ago,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and then three days later,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   when the only election that mattered,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   when Jesus was called out of the grave,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   conquering death.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And I love this country.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   I love America.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I got American socks on right now.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   I love America.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   But America is not our hope.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And our hope as Christians
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   doesn't come from the stars and stripes
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   on the American flag.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It comes from the scars
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   on the hands of our Savior,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   and the stripes on his back,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   that for all of eternity,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   show us the lengths to which God was willing to go
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   for you and for me,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   and the reason why you can trust me,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   no matter what happens,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   and what's ahead.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   So what we're gonna do right now
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   is take a chance to do something we've rarely done,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and I just want to invite us to pray.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   I'm gonna ask you, if you're comfortable,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   in just a second,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   and you're okay,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and there's no physical reason why you couldn't,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   or you're okay with doing so,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   we're just gonna hit our knees.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   We've got spread out, we've got spaces,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   and you can just turn, and we can hit our knees.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And we're gonna pray specifically for a few things.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   This is a crazy, it's a crazy time.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And I want you to pray for both presidents or candidates.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I want you to pray for Joe Biden
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   to have a deep, abiding relationship with Jesus.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And if you just left the Trump rally,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   and you're like, "I hate that guy."
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   If you don't want Joe Biden
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   to spend eternity with Jesus,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   there is something deeply wrong with you.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   If you're on the opposite spectrum,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   and you're like, "No, I can't believe you would even say,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   "pray for Trump."
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   If you don't want President Trump
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   to spend eternity with Jesus,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   there is something deeply wrong with you.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And neither, wherever they sit in this life,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   matters way less than where they will spend eternity.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And so we're gonna pray for both of them,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   that God, you would save them.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   You answer prayers all the time.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And we're gonna storm heaven and just say,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "Would you save these men?"
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   If they have a relationship with you,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   would you kindle it so that it would be
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   the guiding force in their life,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   how they tweet, how they pass policy,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   how they do everything?
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And then I want you to pray for elected officials
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   just across the board, mayors, senators.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   If you live in Fayetteville, those in Arkansas.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   If you live in Boise, Idaho, pray for those in Idaho.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   If you live in Houston, pray for those in Harris County.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   If you live in Philadelphia, pray for those in Pennsylvania.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   If you live in different locations that are tuning in,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   I just want you to pray for elected officials
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   that God would have rulers who are ruled by him
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   leading in our country.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And then I want you to pray for the church,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   that in the midst of the chaos in this world,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   that we would be strong, we would be salt and light.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   There's a lot of hurting people.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   There's a lot of people that don't have work right now.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   There's a lot of people that can't afford to pay,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   pay their mortgage, they can't feed their kids.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   I'm not sure they'll ever have life
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   the way that they thought life was supposed to look back.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   And the church and our opportunity to care for all people
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   has never been greater.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And listen to me very closely, policies matter.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   We should talk about the economy, that stuff matters.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   We should talk about race relations,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   that stuff matters, biblically, from a race.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   The most significant thing about a person
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   is whether they're gonna spend eternity with Jesus or not.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Economy, both if you are rich and if you're poor,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   you need Jesus, both alike.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Policies matter.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   We should talk about COVID and getting a vaccine,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   but here's the reality, vaccine or not,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   everyone is going to die and spend eternity somewhere.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And there is no vaccine that can save anyone
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   from the disease of sin.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   But there is a cure.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Jesus is extended, and so we're gonna pray
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   as the church of Jesus Christ,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   that God, would the gospel go forward in our land,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   would revival break out, would you start in our hearts,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and would you save people, and would the church be strong,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   because there is gonna be a huge opportunity
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   to give the world the peace it's looking for,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   the hope it's looking for,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   the fighting for rights it's looking for.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Those things don't just fall out of the sky
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   and come from nowhere,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   but they're clearly represented in the Bible
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   and the text and the Christian perspective on the world,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   so we're gonna pray that the church,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   like never before, would spread like wildfire.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And then I'm gonna close this in prayer,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   we're gonna sing a couple more songs.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   But just right now, I wanna invite you,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   if you're comfortable, to storm the gates of heaven,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   a few thousand of us all around this campus,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   those listening elsewhere,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   if you would just be comfortable getting on your knees,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   spending time praying for presidents or candidates,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   other local leaders, and for the church.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And then I'll pray and bring us out of it.
