[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.840]   - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Porch.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.520]   If we haven't met, my name is JD,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.280]   and we are so glad that you are here.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.840]   Like Carson said, we have been going through a series
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.280]   called The Seven Deadly Sins.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.480]   And we've been talking about different things
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.720]   that people have just said,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.840]   hey, we know that all sins are equal,
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.920]   but these things, these seven sins,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.120]   if you let them rule your life,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160]   dictate your life and how you live,
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880]   it can end catastrophically for you.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.240]   We've talked about anger, pride, greed, lust,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.480]   so many different things.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840]   And we are finishing strong tonight
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.440]   with the deadly sin of jealousy.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.680]   And right off the bat,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.040]   a lot of people in this kind of seven deadly sin talk,
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.480]   some say it's envy, some call it jealousy.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.600]   I'm gonna kind of just mix the two together.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360]   I'll be saying jealousy a lot tonight,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.820]   but I just wanna define what those things
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.900]   are clearly for us.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220]   And so envy or jealousy, right off the bat is this,
[00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.080]   a feeling of discontentment
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.080]   caused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.600]   That's how people in the world today define jealousy.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.960]   A feeling of discontentment caused by someone else's
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.880]   possessions, qualities, or luck.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.520]   And basically what that means in casual language
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.680]   is when someone else has something that we want
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   or we desire, we look at what we have and what they have.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.920]   And there's just like this angst that we have
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.000]   towards them that builds up, and that is jealousy.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.640]   And I was just thinking about this
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.920]   over the 4th of July weekend,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.480]   I was looking at Instagram and I was like, there it is.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.980]   If you wanna find a jealous JD, invite him to the lake,
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.360]   because that is when all of the insecurities in me come out.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960]   If anyone has been to a day at the lake,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.080]   we've all been there, we've all seen it.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.200]   You get there, every dude, it seems like,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.060]   just can't wait to take off their shirt.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.440]   I can't wait to like keep mine on.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.360]   Everyone is like taking a thousand pictures.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.640]   I'm like, why do we have to take,
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.280]   I'm always like the one guy with his shirt on,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.320]   like what's up?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.600]   And it's just like the worst thing ever.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.200]   It's just like, everyone's hugging and you're like,
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.400]   oh, this is so weird because we're all in our swimsuits.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.120]   And I am just like this like pit of insecurities,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.920]   but I'm also looking around at everyone
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.280]   and I'm examining like what they look like.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.320]   And I'm like secretly like judging people.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   And I'm just like, man, they just look at them.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.000]   They just work out so much apparently,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.940]   they just want everyone to see.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.600]   And I'm just infested with jealousy towards people.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   Some of them I don't even know, but then it just gets worse.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.400]   I know like a lot of us will get out on the boats
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.600]   and I'm the guy that's like sitting over to the side.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.200]   You know, I'm drinking my Waterloo
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920]   and I am sitting there and the music's playing
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.160]   and the guys was like, let's get the weightboard out.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.960]   And I'm like, oh God, not the weightboard.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.840]   And they get it out.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.440]   I've never weightboarded before.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.640]   I'm like more of a tubing guy.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.600]   I'm over here like I'll chill
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.260]   till the tubing segment comes along.
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.480]   That's when I'll show off my skills.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.180]   And the guys start weightboarding, even the girls,
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.000]   a couple of them get up and then the inevitable happens.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.280]   There's always that guy.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.240]   And he's usually like the sporty guy who's like,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   hey JD, why don't you give it a try?
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.680]   Like, get out there, give it a go.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.720]   And I'm like, oh no, it's fine.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.920]   Like you guys, let's make this day about y'all.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160]   And everyone's like JD, JD.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.120]   And I'm like, oh, so I get out there reluctantly.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.960]   You know how it goes.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.300]   Like you're supposed to like sit back
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.760]   and like hold the thing.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.300]   And then they're like, you're ready.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.160]   And you're like, oh yeah, I'm sure.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.600]   And every single time, if you've never weightboarded,
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.000]   it's just like, (mimics beatboxing)
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.820]   every time and people are like, oh, it's your first time.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.440]   And then the 10th time gets along
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.720]   and you're just getting more like shaky and tired.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.160]   Your eyes and you've absorbed so much water
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.560]   and your life is just miserable.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.000]   And so eventually you throw in the towel, you give up,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.520]   you get back on the boat.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.660]   And there's always that guy.
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.760]   For me, he was one of my dearest friends.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.720]   His name is Kylan.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.280]   Kylan is the guy.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.680]   He just has the perfect hair.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   He has the wife.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.840]   He has the looks.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.660]   He has the bod.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.160]   He's just ripped beyond imaginable leaf.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.300]   And he is like, I guess I'll go now.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.240]   And he like hands over,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.580]   he's the one that's been driving the boat,
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.300]   you know, with like looking all cool.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.720]   And then Kylan goes and Kylan, ha, he gets out there.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.080]   And he's like one-handed, like, all right, let's go.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.680]   And Kylan just gets up perfectly.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.040]   He's like, just like soaring.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.640]   Like it's like he's gliding across the water.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.400]   He's like, all right, spin it sharp.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   And you're like, no, he's not.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.240]   No, he's not.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.820]   All the cameras are out on Kylan.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.920]   I'm sitting at the front of the boat,
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.640]   just mad shirt back on by the way.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.080]   And he just jumps the wake and everyone's like,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.920]   Kylan, Kylan.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.080]   And I'm just like, Kylan.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.800]   And that is what jealousy does.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.200]   Someone I love, I'm now feeling some type of way towards.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.240]   And he's just doing his thing.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.920]   Like he's wayboarded all of his life
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.260]   and it's just fun to him.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.500]   But for me, I was having no fun
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.020]   because that's the power of jealousy.
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.680]   Jealousy can destroy us from the inside out.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.960]   It can take something that was once beautiful
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.780]   and united and divided and rip it apart.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.740]   It can take someone that you once loved
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.900]   and it can form hatred.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.940]   And jealousy can rob us of so much life,
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.940]   so many relationships, so much joy and peace and happiness.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.140]   Jealousy will rip us from.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.740]   Proverbs 27, four goes as far to say,
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.120]   anger is cruel and wrath is like a flood,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.480]   but jealousy is even more dangerous.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.180]   God's word says, hey, jealousy,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.760]   those other guys have nothing on this.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.000]   Jealousy is so dangerous.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.060]   And so tonight I'm glad that we get to end
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.140]   just talking about something that God clearly cares about.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.140]   And I just wanna do that by journeying through this story
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.540]   that Jesus tells a crowd in the book of Matthew.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.340]   And so what we're gonna see here is Jesus
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.980]   is just sitting around with this crowd.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.660]   They're sitting and he's telling again,
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.580]   a parable like I talked about a couple of weeks ago.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.600]   He's just telling this story
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.980]   that's illustrating a deeper meaning and point.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.620]   And in this story, what we're gonna see is three things.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.860]   Three things about jealousy.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.260]   We're gonna see first how jealousy presents,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.220]   second, who jealousy resents,
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.140]   and then lastly, where jealousy relents.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.420]   And I know some of you might be here and I'm like, okay,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.740]   that's a little bit of a stretch.
[00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.500]   You guys have no idea how hard it is
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.220]   to come up with rhymes and like alliterations
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.040]   every single week.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.940]   So actually it wasn't me who thought of that one.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.780]   It was David.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.540]   So if you have any problems in beef, like, all right,
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.780]   email dmarv@theporch.live.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.340]   But where jealousy relents,
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.900]   and I was like, David, what does that mean?
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.660]   And it basically means like ends or stops, okay?
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.900]   Where jealousy ends or stops,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.100]   but to keep us relevant and remembering
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.300]   where jealousy relents.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.240]   So turn with me, everyone.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.020]   We have a few friends in the house, socially distanced.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.180]   Matthew chapter 20, if you're watching online,
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.020]   grab your Bible.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.120]   We're gonna read a lot of scripture tonight
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.200]   and open up to Matthew 20
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.720]   and we'll read verses one through 12 together.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.280]   "For the kingdom of heaven is like the landowner
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.320]   who went out early one morning
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.400]   to hire workers for his vineyard.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.280]   He agreed to pay the normal daily wage
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.920]   and sent them out to work.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.040]   At nine o'clock in the morning,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.580]   he was passing through the marketplace
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.080]   and he saw some people standing around doing nothing.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.260]   So he hired them, telling them he would pay them
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.860]   whatever was right at the end of the day.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.960]   So they went to work in the vineyard at noon
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960]   and again at three o'clock,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.360]   he did the same thing at five o'clock that afternoon.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.320]   He was in town again
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.000]   and saw some more people standing around.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.760]   He asked them, why haven't you been working today?
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.040]   And they replied, because no one's hired us.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.000]   The landowner told him,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.340]   then go out and join the others in my vineyard.
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.000]   That evening, he told the foreman to call the workers in
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   and pay them, beginning with the last workers first.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.260]   When those hired at five o'clock were paid,
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.380]   each received a full day's wage.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.960]   When those hired first came to get their pay,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   they assumed they would receive more.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.920]   I mean, it makes sense.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.080]   They've been there longer,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.240]   but they too were paid a day's wage.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.060]   When they received their pay, they protested to the owner.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.760]   Those people worked only for one hour
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   and yet you've paid them just as much as you've paid us
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.280]   who worked all day in the scorching heat.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.560]   Totally valid argument.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.720]   These workers have been there all day since the morning,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.820]   just working in the heat.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.240]   They didn't have water fountains back then.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.680]   They're sitting there going, hey, we're thirsty.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.040]   We're tired. We're hot.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.120]   We've been working all day.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.600]   And you've been giving these people who got here
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.740]   at the end of the day,
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.720]   just as much money as you've given us.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.080]   And I can even read that
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.200]   and be like the crowd members at the time going,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.820]   hey, Jesus, that doesn't seem very fair.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.220]   Like that seems like really unjust for the land owner
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.260]   to kind of give everyone the equal amount of pay,
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.520]   even though some worked harder than others.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.040]   But what's so funny is a lot of times like jealousy,
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.760]   it doesn't just form.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.660]   We don't just meet someone and immediately we're like,
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.920]   I'm jealous of you.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.280]   Like, I mean, maybe sometimes,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.960]   but a lot of times we need to like pin it on a reason
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.560]   or something that seems like unfair
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.920]   or like something that just seems off
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.520]   and create something within us
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.660]   that creates us to be jealous of a human.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.700]   For these people, it was the fact,
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.800]   it was more circumstantial.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.080]   They looked at them like, hey,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.920]   it's not fair that the land owner is treating them
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.800]   and blessing them for something
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.520]   that I don't think they deserve.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.000]   Look at verse 10.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.460]   When those hired first came to get their pay,
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.940]   they assumed they would receive more,
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.540]   but they too were paid a day's wage.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.080]   And then skipping down to verse 12,
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.200]   their response to that was,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.760]   hey, those people worked only one hour
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.000]   and yet you paid them just as much as you paid us
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.040]   to work all day in the scorching heat.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.320]   And that's what jealousy causes us to do.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.000]   Jealousy causes us to fixate on people
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.380]   and make people the problem.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.240]   And so how jealousy presents itself is through comparison.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.880]   How does jealousy present?
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.520]   Through comparison.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.160]   These people looked at their work
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.040]   and the time that they put in and they expected more.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.760]   And once they compared their work
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.520]   to the amount of the other people's work,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.240]   it didn't line up for them.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.200]   And it created angst and jealousy
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.600]   towards them and the other workers.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.800]   You see, the real issue isn't what we have.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.840]   Like, it's not about exactly what I have.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.280]   It's not even about a lot of times what others have.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.560]   It's what I have in light of what others have.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.800]   And when I begin to weigh what I have
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.720]   versus what other people have, AKA comparison,
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.960]   that's when jealousy starts to form in my heart.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.980]   And when we start to compare,
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.880]   when we start to look at people and make them a problem,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.280]   immediately there's gonna be separation and division.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.920]   And we're gonna start to look at their job and go,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.320]   well, I wish I had that job.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.400]   Or we're gonna look at how they don't have any debt
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.340]   and how they're debt-free
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.720]   or they got a scholarship in college.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.680]   It's like, well, I'm piling up in credit card debt
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.840]   and all different types of debt.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.240]   We're gonna look at Instagram and scroll
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.720]   and see relationships and be like,
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.960]   how come they get to be in a relationship?
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.720]   I've waited my whole life for someone.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.360]   I've protected myself or whatever,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.620]   and I still don't have a relationship.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.560]   We're gonna look at all these different things
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.120]   and start to compare, compare me versus them.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   My problems versus their problems.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.080]   My hair versus their hair.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.960]   My pay versus their pay.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.020]   My followers versus their followers.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.200]   My relationships, my people versus their relationships
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.160]   and their people.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.720]   And it's just this constant battle that robs and steals
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.360]   and robs and steals.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.080]   And it all comes through comparison,
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.560]   which is what fuels jealousy.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.960]   You have to see that jealousy, it's like a blinder.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.320]   It causes you to fixate on things
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.840]   and make you think they're the problem,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.920]   but they're not actually the problem.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.100]   The problem is you're comparing yourself
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.760]   to people that you shouldn't be comparing yourself to.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.000]   It's like this.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.840]   If I just, right now,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.400]   let's say we were all here in the house and I said,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.600]   "Hey, I wanna call up someone."
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.080]   And there's three jars here,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.080]   each have a prize inside of them.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.120]   All you have to do is open up a jar
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.840]   and you get whatever's inside.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.160]   You are the lucky winner.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.320]   And I just call on you.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.140]   And let's say it's you,
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.060]   you come up here and you're thinking about it.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.280]   There's not much strategy to it.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.040]   There's not much that you can do.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.760]   All you have to do is take a pick and be the lucky winner.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.340]   You're gonna win something.
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.940]   So let's say you're thinking about it and you're like,
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.440]   "Okay, I picked this one."
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.800]   And what do you know?
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.080]   You win a Benjamin.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.720]   You get $100 on the porch.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.280]   And you're like, "Oh my gosh, this is the best day ever."
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   I bet the crowd would be like, "Nice, okay, like 100 bucks."
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.200]   And you're feeling like a winner.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.360]   You're like, "I made the right pick."
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.480]   But then let's say I call up someone else
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.440]   and let's say she comes up here and I'm like,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.960]   "Okay, you have two options.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.640]   You now get to pick whatever jar you want."
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.680]   And you're walking away.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.720]   You're like, "Man, I'm so like, I got $100.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.840]   I made the right pick, I am good."
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.980]   But then she comes and she's like,
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.560]   "Okay, I'll pick the opposite side."
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   And she opens it up and she wins two free tickets to Hawaii
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.200]   'cause the porch got it like that now.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   And she gets to go on a vacation to Hawaii
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.600]   with someone that she wants to go with.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.120]   And suddenly the crowd erupts and you're like,
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.960]   "Oh, what, Hawaii?"
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.080]   And you're thinking, "Why didn't I pick the left one?
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.640]   I just got a hundred bucks."
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.600]   And suddenly what was once seeming something
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.720]   that you were grateful for, was a value,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.160]   is now nothing because you're comparing it
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.080]   to what the other person got.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.040]   That moment, what was once filled with gratitude and joy
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.200]   is now robbed because of comparison.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.880]   And that's what we do way more than we realize
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.080]   in our everyday lives.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.800]   I thought about this, like a lot of times I get jealous
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.400]   of people I don't even know.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.600]   Like it's really easy to be sitting at home
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.480]   on a Friday night and I'm like super content.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.320]   I'm like chilling, watching something on TV, I don't know,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.560]   probably like "Emperor's New Groove."
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.440]   And I'm watching it and I see, I'm like,
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.640]   "Okay, now I'll check Instagram."
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.840]   And I'm on Instagram stories.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.800]   And I see one of my friends posted a story and I watch it
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.280]   and they're like out eating Mexican food.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.120]   And this new guy I've heard about got invited.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.840]   And had they been eating, I probably would have been fine
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.760]   not getting the invite,
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.720]   but how come a new guy got the invite and I didn't?
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.680]   And I was completely content
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.720]   until I started comparing myself to new guy.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.560]   What?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.960]   New guy, but he thinks he's funny.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.880]   I bet he's the one like ruling the table right now.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.720]   Like new guy, what's up with this new guy?
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.360]   And suddenly I just have all of this like built up tension
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.480]   towards new guy.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.440]   New guy has done nothing, he just got an invite to go eat.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.800]   But now the next time I see new guy, let's call him Bobby,
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.880]   I'm trying to call him new guy.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.400]   Next time I see Bobby, Bobby's like, "What's up, man?
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.280]   I've heard a lot about you."
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.080]   And I'm like, "Yeah, nice."
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.640]   And I'm just like immediately just so jealous of Bobby
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.600]   for something Bobby couldn't control.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.920]   Just like the girl right here,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.640]   she couldn't control the jar that you picked,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.320]   she just picked a jar as well.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.520]   But so many times that's what comparison does.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.360]   It makes people the problem
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.000]   and it causes you to miss out
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.760]   of what God is trying to show you.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.040]   And so with all of this,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.080]   when you realize that you've been robbed,
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.440]   when you realize that you've been just taken
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.040]   the chance of having happiness and relationships and peace,
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.240]   and you start to wake up kind of this like reality
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.200]   that people aren't the problem,
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.600]   and I should stop comparing,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.480]   you have to address a deeper issue, which is point two,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.120]   who jealousy resents, who jealousy actually resents.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.920]   Because jealousy will lead you to think
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.840]   the problem is people, but who jealousy actually resents.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.880]   Let's see in the story what Jesus has to say.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.160]   Verse 13, "He answered one of them,
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.440]   "Friend, I haven't been unfair."
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.320]   So remember they're sitting here like to the landowner,
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.880]   like, "Hey, why are you giving these people
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   "the same money as us?
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.000]   "We've done all these different amounts of,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.400]   "we've done more work than them."
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.240]   And the crowd that Jesus is telling this to
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.840]   are probably like, "Hey, yeah, that really does seem unfair.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.000]   "They should get more money."
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.840]   And this is what Jesus says, that the landowner says,
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.640]   "Hey, friend, I haven't been unfair.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.240]   "Didn't you agree to work all day for the usual wage?
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.200]   "Take your money and go.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.520]   "I wanted to pay this last worker the same as you."
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.720]   Verse 15 is powerful.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.480]   "Is it against the law for me to do
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.320]   "what I want with my money?
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.640]   "Should you be jealous because I am kind to others?"
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.280]   Jesus, he anticipated the thoughts of the crowd
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.060]   and he leaned into that and said,
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.200]   "Hey, you have to remember something.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.920]   "What people around you have been given,
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.960]   "the success they've seen, the looks that they have,
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.520]   "the body type they have,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.580]   "the way that they've climbed the corporate ladder,
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.800]   "the way their family is,
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.320]   "the way what they've been born into
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.040]   "had nothing to do with them.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.920]   "I get to dictate and I am the one who is in control
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.440]   "of what my children have,
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.340]   "of what my people have."
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.400]   Just the same way that this landowner got to dictate
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.560]   what he did with his money,
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.860]   so God gets to dictate what he does with his people.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.960]   And so when you communicate that you have an issue
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.120]   with what someone else has versus what you have,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.680]   and you're comparing yourself all the time,
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.300]   what you're actually communicating
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.760]   is that you are resenting God, not man.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.020]   Who does jealousy resent?
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.620]   Your creator.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.440]   You don't have a problem with creation.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.000]   You actually have a problem with your creator.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.520]   That's what jealousy does.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.460]   Think about it.
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.320]   So much of our life,
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.480]   we look at other people's circumstances.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.460]   I know for me, I look at people who have the perfect family,
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.360]   who eat dinner together like every Sunday night
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.320]   and are gathering around and telling stories and laughing
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.960]   and have inside jokes and maybe like make family TikToks,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.800]   I don't know.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.540]   And I'm like, "God, why would you not give me that?
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.740]   "Why would you not want that for me?
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.480]   "You're the one that's in control."
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.920]   And I had to remember, wow,
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.760]   like God gets to do what he wants when he wants.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.820]   And it's when I think that I have a say
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.820]   is when I get in trouble.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.420]   But I'm not content with what God's given me.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.560]   I'm not interested in stewarding what God's given me.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.520]   Therefore, I resent him.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.360]   I say, and I think we say things like,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.980]   "God, you didn't give me looks
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.440]   "like you gave that person looks."
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.280]   Girls, you might say,
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.400]   "God, you didn't make my waist a size two.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.140]   "God, you didn't bless me with that family
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.940]   "or with that financial situation or with that spouse
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.860]   "or with those gifts, with that job.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.680]   "God, why did my parents be the parents that divorced?
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.780]   "Why couldn't I have parents like theirs?"
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.600]   I know for me, like a couple of weekends ago,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.780]   I spent the weekend with all my college roommates.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.840]   They all have kids now.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.080]   Some of them are on their second kid.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:54.900]   They're all married.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.980]   And they're just, they're sitting there with their spouses.
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.560]   And I'm the only single guy.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.000]   Talked about that before, I think it's clearly an issue.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.880]   And I'm just like, "God, what's the deal, man?
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.200]   "Like, why can't I be like them?"
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.800]   And I don't resent them.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.000]   They're just, they met the one.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.040]   They're doing their thing.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.120]   They're living their life.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.720]   Who I'm actually resenting is my creator.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.680]   And I think a lot of us are there.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.380]   We are upset with God.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.080]   We would rather resent him and push him away
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.980]   and think he's out to get us or he's withholding from us,
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.880]   that he wants to bless other people and favor other people
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.400]   and not make us as gifted or as successful.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.860]   We think that God is out to get us somehow.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.120]   It's like we've forgotten all that he's done.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.000]   Like earlier, think about this.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.760]   What if I called up a third person?
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.200]   And what if they opened up the last jar
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.400]   and they got starburst?
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.680]   Starburst.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.480]   And not even starburst, the orange and yellow starburst.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.520]   Okay, the worst of the worst.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.280]   The lowest of these, you could say.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.080]   Once they opened up their orange and yellow starburst,
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.320]   suddenly I'm like, "All right,
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.640]   "well, at least I didn't get the yellow
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.520]   "and orange starburst.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.740]   "My hundred's starting to look a little bit better now.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.280]   "Miko, see now on me tonight."
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.280]   And that is crazy because we, at one time,
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.300]   were resentful because we didn't get the trip to Hawaii.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.540]   But when we saw that we didn't get the starburst,
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.540]   we no longer resent, but we're grateful for the $100.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.620]   I think a lot of us sit there with our lives.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.120]   It's easy to sit in your single apartment alone
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.700]   and look at the married couple with their first house
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.280]   and first car in Labradoodle and resent them
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.720]   and resent how God is moving and blessing their life.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.240]   But then when you sit and think what he's brought you out of
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.920]   and the job he's given you,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.520]   or how you're not homeless or left alone
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.820]   and the people that love you,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.700]   resentment starts to turn into gratitude.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.920]   And your perspective of what God is
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.800]   and who he is starts to change.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.720]   We have to stop resenting our creator
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.960]   and trust that he is in control
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   and knows what to do with his creation.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   For those of you that are coming in here
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.000]   and you're recognizing, wow,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.940]   I thought I had a problem with people.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.540]   I thought I was jealous of that guy or that girl.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.320]   I thought I wanted that job.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.560]   I thought I needed that much money.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   And I thought God, I thought he just didn't hear me or care.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.760]   I'm leaning in and I want you to hear me say
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.580]   that that just isn't true.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.820]   That God loves you.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:51.100]   More than anything, he loves you and he cares about you.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.180]   And I had to remind myself of this often
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.980]   'cause I know that in my small limited mind,
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.260]   I can forget to zoom out and see the bigger picture
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.420]   and just focus on what's right in front of me
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.740]   or the people right in front of me
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.220]   or the circumstances right in front of me
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.380]   and forget that God isn't taking something from me.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.940]   He's not withholding something from me.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.120]   He's not playing like puppet master up there
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.660]   and just like doing all this crazy things
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.920]   to hurt me and to harm me.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.980]   No, he is a father who is willing to give everything for me,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.620]   who has given everything to me.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.500]   I have to think about the fact that God has taken me out
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.660]   of so much broken sexual sin and addiction.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.880]   He's taken me out of the depression I felt
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.260]   after my dad passed away.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.020]   He's taken me out of the misery I felt from heartache
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.420]   and so many different things.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.700]   And when I sit and I open up my perspective
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.660]   and I become grateful for what God has taken me out of,
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.180]   I no longer resent him.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.000]   I rest in him, I trust him.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.720]   And that's what I'm calling you to do.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   Stop resenting God.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.600]   Stop thinking that God is out to get you.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.560]   He loves you.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.640]   He wants to give you everything.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.820]   But jealousy will do everything
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.440]   to not allow you to believe that.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.920]   Here's what jealousy will do.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.600]   It wants you to think that God robs you
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.180]   of all the things you want
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.940]   rather than gives you than all the things that you need.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.880]   Jealousy wants you to believe that God robs you
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.180]   of all the things that you want
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.680]   rather than gives you all the things that you truly need.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.000]   He knows you more than you know yourself.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.800]   And you might look out and see people and think,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.200]   I want that, I want that, I need that to survive.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.340]   I need that to be happy.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.560]   I need that to be joyful.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.880]   And I trust you, you need to trust God.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.680]   That's what we need, to rest in God.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.600]   And when we do that, the third point will start to happen.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.200]   Where jealousy relents, where jealousy ends and stops
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.820]   is when comparison turns to celebration.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.320]   That is where jealousy ends, is with celebration.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.760]   Just take a moment to sit and think about
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.560]   all that God's done in your life.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.160]   Let celebration turn into gratitude
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.800]   and an awakening and a realization of,
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.640]   oh my gosh, God is at work.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.400]   He is doing something in my life.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.920]   First Thessalonians 5, 18 says,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.200]   "Be thankful in all circumstances,
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.160]   for this is God's will for you,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.280]   who belongs to Christ Jesus."
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.560]   Think about the last time that God clearly worked
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.040]   and moved in your life.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.440]   Think about how grateful you were.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.280]   Thank you, God.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.600]   You were telling everyone, man, God, he gave me the job
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.760]   or God, he really pulled through.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.840]   He heard my cry.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.720]   I'm so grateful.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.600]   I'm so thankful.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.420]   Thank you, God.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.260]   Thank you, God.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.000]   And the more and more time from that moment
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.680]   that life goes on and life goes on, you start to forget.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.520]   And time separates and no longer are you celebrating
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.480]   what God has done.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.500]   You get back to comparing.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.640]   You get back in your tunnel vision.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.760]   You start to think, oh, things are out of my control.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.600]   God, where are you at?
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.440]   God, where are you at?
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.680]   And you're not remembering what he did for you.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.280]   Therefore, your life is not informed by celebration
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.400]   or gratitude.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.620]   It now goes back into the cycle of jealousy and anger
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.960]   and bitterness and resentment and comparison.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.400]   And now you're all out of whack again.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.660]   And so you have to fight these things by celebrating,
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.340]   by being grateful.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.540]   There are so many times in my life
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.160]   when I choose to be discontent over grateful.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.980]   There's so many times where I let jealousy creep in
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.980]   and distract from what God's doing.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.480]   There's so many times where he's blessed me
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.660]   with the hundred dollar bill and I'm going,
[00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.260]   but I wanted the trip to Hawaii.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:28.360]   And I forget, but hey, you have taken me out of so much.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.260]   And so my encouragement to you would be don't run away.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.120]   Don't shy away.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.780]   Don't let jealousy cause division between you and people
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.300]   or you and God, but rather turn jealousy,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.180]   turn comparison, turn resentment
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.420]   into celebration and gratitude.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.000]   I cannot stress this enough.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.460]   It is a powerful weapon.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.120]   The enemy of jealousy is out to rob you,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.180]   but it will convince you that God's the thief.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.500]   It'll convince you that God is taking.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.260]   God is withholding.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.460]   So how do you fight that?
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.900]   You remember what he's done and you celebrate it.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:08.380]   But when jealousy does lead you to compare
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.500]   and make people the issue or resent God,
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.020]   when it gets hard to celebrate,
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.740]   I think what I was thinking about was like,
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.380]   what does this look like for me practically in my life?
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.740]   Like, how do I do this?
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.660]   How am I practicing this?
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.460]   And this is always like an encouraging thing for me
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.660]   to rework this like value of celebration.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.460]   And I had to sit and think behind every person
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.900]   that I compare myself to as a story,
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.480]   a story of brokenness and mistakes, just like me,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.620]   a person who needs Jesus, just like me,
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.900]   the person who needs the gospel, just like me.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.420]   And I should go celebrate that.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.020]   I should go lean in and hear their story
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.460]   and equalize them in my mind
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.820]   and watch how God has formed them.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:53.500]   And when I started to see people made in the image of God,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.020]   and when I started to see myself made in the image of God,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.140]   it starts to be way easier to celebrate.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.220]   And I started to do things like texting and calling people
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.860]   just to tell them what I see in them
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.260]   and how proud I am of them.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.820]   I started to just, I recently in quarantine,
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.540]   I start sending selfie videos to people
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.060]   just to just pump them up
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.020]   and tell them the work I see God doing in their life.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.980]   I make a list of my closest friend's birthdays
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.180]   to make sure I don't miss it
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.340]   and telling them what they mean to me
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:16.700]   and what their life means to me.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.060]   And more than anything,
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.140]   I sit and I think about all that God's done in my life
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.260]   and I celebrate him for who he is and it changes me.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.820]   It rids me of comparison
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.940]   and it brings me the joy and peace in him
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.020]   that I'm looking for.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.740]   And how do I stay grateful?
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.260]   I've recently just charged myself
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.180]   to keep a running list of all the things I'm grateful for.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.580]   I spent time just today writing down more things.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.580]   God, thank you for my family
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.420]   I got to see over the 4th of July weekend.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.260]   Thank you that you've brought my mom a spouse that loves her
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.340]   and I got to meet my new step siblings.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.100]   Thank you God that you've provided me community
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   in my first year here in Dallas.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.500]   I know a lot of people still feel alone
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.860]   and I don't deserve such amazing people in my life.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.800]   Thank you for my job and my health.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.740]   And start off your prayers with just thankfulness
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.540]   rather than asking.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.300]   And it will change your perspective on who God is.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.800]   And you'll see jealousy start to lose its grip in your life.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:17.140]   I know for me, like the longest stint
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.060]   where I saw jealousy really own me
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.500]   was in my high school years
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.820]   where I became extremely jealous of my little brother.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.100]   My little brother, he's 17 months younger than me.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.500]   He's like way taller than me,
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.420]   way more fit and athletic than me.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.460]   And all of high school,
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:37.040]   I just jealousy turned to hatred in my heart towards him.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.420]   The Bible talks about how can you say you love God
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.700]   and have hatred towards your brother?
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.460]   And I didn't.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.260]   And I chose to resent him and bully him and be mean to him.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.140]   In my life, my relationship with him,
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.860]   that was supposed to be leadership and love
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.260]   and stewarding him as my little brother.
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.060]   God entrusted me with a little brother.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:00.780]   I missed it because I let jealousy divide
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.980]   and create hostility.
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.780]   And I missed so many opportunities.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.820]   And thank God he's now moved to Dallas
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.480]   and we're trying to get weekly lunches
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.020]   where I can sit in and mend all the years of hurts
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.040]   and brokenness that I caused.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.420]   And if you hear anything, don't make the mistake I did.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.640]   Don't let jealousy dictate your relationships.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.440]   Don't let jealousy rob you of one more thing.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.000]   Because a life with God does not look like robbing.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.160]   It does not look like taking.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.500]   It looks like giving.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:35.700]   Love, grace, freedom, forgiveness, what we actually need.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.580]   But the reality was,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.220]   is I was not pleased with my reality growing up.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   Before Christ, I couldn't see what all he was doing
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.680]   in my life and what all he was orchestrating in my life.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.320]   All I knew is I did not like my reality
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.920]   versus my brother's reality.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.120]   And so therefore, instead of loving him, I hated him.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.600]   And because of that, I hated God.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:09.200]   'Cause I'm like, God, why did you not make me more like him?
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.040]   God, why am I the bad nerd?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.720]   Why am I the guy that no one takes serious?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.520]   Why can't I be more masculine
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.880]   in what society says makes a man?
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.840]   God, why did you make me the way that you did?
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.200]   And I resented God.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.400]   Therefore, I didn't have a relationship with him.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.040]   I didn't understand what he was about.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.520]   And I missed so many years
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.880]   that could have been so fruitful to jealousy.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.080]   And I missed the biggest reality,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.920]   the most world-changing reality for every single one of us,
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.680]   is that there is a form of jealousy that is righteous.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.040]   There is a form of jealousy that is okay,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.640]   and it is possessed by God.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.360]   God holds this form of jealousy.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.080]   The Bible says in Exodus 34, 14,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.080]   this verse just shook up my world this week.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.440]   It says, God was talking to his people
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.320]   known as the Israelites in the Old Testament.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.640]   He says, "You must worship no other gods.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.000]   For the Lord, whose very name is jealous,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.760]   is a God who is jealous about his relationship with you."
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.520]   And as I looked into that, I could not believe.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.360]   Wait, you mean to tell me
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.760]   that the God who created the universe,
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.800]   the God who spoke and it was so,
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.000]   the God who sees me choose jealousy and comparison
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.880]   and resentment and resistance and anger
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.560]   and bitterness and frustration
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.360]   and doesn't trust him, it doesn't come to him.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.280]   He saw that I was gonna do that,
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.000]   and he still is jealous of me?
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.520]   And for you, you might be sitting there thinking,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.560]   there's no way that God would want me that bad.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.880]   I know that he loves me,
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.160]   but I don't think he likes me enough to be jealous of me,
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.520]   to really want my time.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.360]   I think he's okay if I kind of half-heartedly
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.240]   give myself to him, if I read my Bible here and there,
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.720]   if I pray every now and then.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.280]   I just don't think he's that concerned.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.200]   He kind of has the world to take care of, you know?
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.000]   Like there's a lot going on right now in 2020.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.720]   If you haven't noticed, he's not worried about me.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.400]   And I'm telling you that this says
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.600]   that God is jealous of you.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.200]   He's jealous.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.280]   He's so jealous of us.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.040]   He wants our attention
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:34.600]   and our affections and our trust and our love so bad
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.480]   that he would be willing to send his son
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.800]   because he saw that we would get distracted.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.040]   He saw that we would choose the world,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.200]   but he said, I want them so bad,
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.720]   I'm gonna send my only son to die for them.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.440]   That way I can be in relationship with them.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.480]   I know they won't choose me all the time.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.720]   I know they'll get distracted by other people in comparison.
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.280]   I know they're gonna resent me,
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.920]   but I want them.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.040]   He wants you.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.600]   (soft music)
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.200]   And that truth, it changed me.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.040]   At the age of 19, when I woke up and realized
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.760]   that God loved me so much
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.800]   that he sent his son to die for me,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.080]   that there was a creator
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.840]   that wanted me that bad, I couldn't resist it.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.920]   And so what I want to beg of you tonight,
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.360]   if there's something that you think that God is doing
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.920]   that isn't fair,
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.200]   if he's giving of himself to the workers
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.840]   who haven't worked as hard as you
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.160]   or the people who haven't been through
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.120]   what you've been through,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.920]   and it seems like they're getting the acknowledgement
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.000]   and the credit and the love and the blessings
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.760]   and the favor that you think you deserve,
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.680]   I'm here to tell you that that is a lie from the enemy.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.240]   God loves you more than anything.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   And so stop running, stop resenting, stop comparing.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.120]   You are being robbed and start trusting
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.600]   and start coming to that love.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.960]   Let's pray.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:29.920]   Father, it really is mind blowing that you would see
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.640]   our sin, that you would see our mistakes,
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   that you would see our brokenness and choices,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.160]   that we would choose other people,
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:47.880]   and yet you still sent your son to die for us.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.160]   And I don't know what my friends tonight are,
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.600]   they're battling jealousy,
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.360]   if they're looking at other people's circumstances,
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.000]   if they're looking at other people
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.520]   and they've forgotten that they are created
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.680]   in the image of God.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.760]   I don't know what people are dealing with tonight,
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.400]   but what I do know is that no matter what it is,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.200]   you love them.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   You love them so much that you are jealous for them.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.680]   You are a jealous God for his children.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.800]   And so I pray tonight,
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.200]   if there's anyone that does not believe
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.080]   they are worthy of your jealousy,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.880]   if there's anyone tonight that does not believe
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.720]   that they deserve that kind of love and trust and pursuit,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.520]   that they would just stop believing the lie,
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:40.320]   that they have to do more or they've made too many mistakes
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.520]   and they would just open up their hands tonight
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.520]   and accept your love.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.080]   For it's in that love, it's in your provision,
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.080]   it's in your goodness that we trust.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.160]   May that be true of us tonight.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Thank you for wanting us. Amen.
