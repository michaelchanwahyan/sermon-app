[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:28.740]   - What's up, Porch family?
[00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.920]   Hey, welcome friends in the room,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.040]   friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix, Arizona,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.320]   Boise, Idaho, Northwest Arkansas, Philadelphia,
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.520]   and all the Porch Live locations,
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.720]   everybody joining us online.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.880]   We are continuing this series,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.040]   Fortune Telling, if we haven't met,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.860]   my name is Dave and I have the privilege of serving
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.440]   and being a part of leading on the team that is here.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.620]   And I could not be more excited
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.120]   for what God is about to do tonight.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.920]   There's a good friend of mine that has been a integral part
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.280]   of how God has started a movement of young adults
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.000]   in this city who is joining us tonight
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.920]   that I'm about to introduce.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.960]   But in terms of communicators, in terms of pastors,
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.160]   in terms of followers of Jesus,
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.040]   I cannot, and I mean those words very seriously,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.760]   think of a single person I could be more excited
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.640]   to step up, open God's word, and teach us here.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.920]   Tonight, Jonathan Pucluta.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.320]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.240]   From Harris Creek, who if you haven't,
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.840]   if you're unaware of, the three of you who don't,
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.000]   JP's been a part of the Porch for a decade
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.680]   and got to serve as one of the closest friends in the world,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.520]   one of the best teachers of God's word
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.320]   when they write the history book
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.820]   of the church in North America 100 years from now.
[00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.200]   It would surprise me if they don't mention his name.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.960]   And the impact that he has had on young adults,
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.920]   it would be embarrassing for me to attempt
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.480]   to communicate how much and how many eternities
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.600]   have been impacted and changed and transformed.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.700]   So with that being said, will you guys please
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.080]   welcome to the stage Jonathan Pucluta.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.920]   - He said that just like I wrote it down, so I'm thankful.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.120]   Man, just a tremendous encourager to me.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.560]   People ask me, was it hard to leave the Porch?
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320]   It was hard to leave the people.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.040]   It wasn't difficult to hand it over to excellent leadership.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640]   And so I'm so excited to be with you guys tonight.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.960]   I know we prayed honestly,
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.040]   everyone should go home after Davy's prayer.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800]   I was like, wow.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.400]   She said propitiation, man.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.480]   I'm like, let's, amen.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.060]   Father, would you open our hearts?
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.080]   And if there's a word that you have for us tonight,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.760]   as we open these ancient truths,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.240]   would you help us to walk to our car
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.840]   in just a moment different?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.600]   And I know that we're on the front lines this evening
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.960]   because we're talking about something
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.120]   that Satan has come after with full force.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.220]   And so would you protect our minds?
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.200]   Would you protect our hearts?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.040]   Would you remove distractions if we're in the loft?
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.320]   If we're in another room right now,
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.920]   would you remove distractions, give us laser focus,
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.580]   help us to hear what we're supposed to hear,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.920]   help me not get in the way.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.100]   If I say something they're not supposed to hear,
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.780]   supernaturally erase it.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.120]   And if I say something consistent with you and your word,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.760]   would you allow it to ring true?
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.540]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.280]   My buddy texts me and says,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.660]   "Hey, do you wanna go to the mall?"
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.800]   And I'm a shopper, okay?
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.760]   Like I know some guys are like, "Ooh, the mall, gross."
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.040]   I'm not that kind of guy.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.360]   Like I'm like, I love the mall.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.040]   And I'm an Enneagram seven.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.480]   So like if you text me and say, "Do you wanna go?"
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.320]   Like really, like, "Do you wanna go get a spinal tap?"
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.240]   Yeah, anywhere.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   Like if I can get out of the house, like I'm in.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.560]   So I'm like, "Yeah, of course I wanna go to the mall."
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.840]   And so he honestly, he's not the kind of guy
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.880]   to say that to.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.480]   Like he's not the shopper, like I'm the shopper,
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.320]   but he's like, "Hey, do you wanna go?"
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.040]   I'm like, "Yes, I wanna go to the mall."
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.620]   And so he's like, "All right, I'm picking you up
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.060]   "on the way to pick you up."
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.940]   And so he does, he picks me up,
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.900]   and we're driving to the mall, and I ask him,
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.820]   his name is Marshall, right?
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.420]   And I say, "Hey, what are you going to the mall for?
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.620]   "Like this is not like you just randomly
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.660]   "in the afternoon to go to the mall.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.700]   "What are you going for?"
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.220]   And he says, "I need a new raincoat."
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.100]   And I'm like, "Oh yeah, raincoat,
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.780]   "because you know, there's been some precipitation lately.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.340]   "So you know, you wanna, you know, get a raincoat."
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.780]   Like I get it, like his other one,
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.640]   he's like, "I got a tear in it."
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.140]   So I'm like, "Cool, man, I'm your wingman.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.540]   "Like I got you.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.600]   "Like I know the mall, I used to work there.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.860]   "You know, I'm gonna hook you, we're gonna go,
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.780]   "and I'll help you."
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.300]   I'm like, "What are you looking for in a raincoat?"
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.180]   And this is what he says.
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.180]   He says, "I'm looking for a North Face Venture 2 color TH
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.920]   "in black size medium with a cinched hood
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.640]   "and a Gore-Tex lining to keep the water out."
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.420]   I was like, "Oh, you're looking for that raincoat, okay."
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.180]   All right, yeah, okay.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.640]   And so it's really interesting the way
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.840]   that we shot the experience that ensued there.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.440]   Because like, we go into the mall,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.700]   but we just go to the stores that sell raincoats.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.120]   And when he walks into the store,
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.040]   you know, the guy's up there, up front,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.400]   he's like, "Hey, sir, can I help you?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.680]   "You know, we have some pants on."
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.200]   He's like, "No, no, no, raincoat."
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.320]   And he goes straight to the rounder that sells raincoats,
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.460]   and then he goes straight to the section
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.140]   that has North Face, then he goes straight to the black ones,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.700]   and then he starts looking at the label for Venture 2,
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.140]   like just laser focused.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.940]   Like, that's not how I shop.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.780]   Like, how I shop, like I go in the mall,
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.620]   and I'm like, ♪ Spirit lead me where ♪
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.180]   You know, I'm like, I'm like, "Where, what is it?"
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.540]   Like, I'm open to being sold.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.180]   You know, I got a little money in my pocket.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.620]   Like, guy comes up, he's like,
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.220]   "Hey, you know, are you looking for anything particular?"
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.620]   I'm like, "No, I'm not looking for anything particular."
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.600]   He's like, "Well, we got, you know, we got these two for one."
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.120]   I'm like, "Show me, show me, I want the sale.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.600]   "Like, where's the deal?"
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.200]   You know, and you find yourself when you don't know,
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.780]   when you're not looking for something,
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.920]   you have to look at everything, right?
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.400]   And so I'm looking at everything,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.320]   and you kind of wander into Zoomies,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.240]   you're like, "Oh man, maybe I need a longboard, you know,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.320]   "'cause I've only got three."
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.920]   And then some dude's like, "Hey, you need some shoes?"
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.080]   I'm like, "Yes, I do need some shoe.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.780]   "I only have 37 pair, yes."
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.800]   You know, and then you find yourself in Brookstone,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.680]   and you're like looking at some head massager,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.520]   hypothetically speaking, you know,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.160]   and it like makes your hair grow.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.760]   And all of a sudden I'm like, "Maybe I need this.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.680]   "Like, maybe I don't have enough hair."
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   And you just, if you don't know what you're looking for,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.500]   you can't find it.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.160]   And most of us date the way that I shop.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.800]   Like, I've spent a lot of time with single people.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.240]   We go throughout the world.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.740]   We're trying to find the one.
[00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.260]   And if you were honest, like if I was to survey you guys,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.620]   I'd say, "What are you looking for?
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:15.620]   "How are you gonna know?
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.300]   "And you're gonna say dumb things to me."
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.700]   Like, "Well, you just know when you know."
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.060]   Anybody ever told you that?
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.940]   You just know when you know.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.060]   You just know when you, and you would say this,
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.140]   you say, "Well, I'm looking for someone who makes me feel."
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.620]   And you fill in the blank.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.460]   "Someone who makes me feel beautiful.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.000]   "Someone who makes me feel good.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.480]   "Someone who makes me feel great.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.820]   "Someone who makes me feel special.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.060]   "You're looking for someone who makes me feel."
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.300]   But here's the public service announcement up front.
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.760]   Feelings come and go.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.620]   Whoever you marry, you're gonna be laying in bed with them
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.680]   beside them one day, and you're gonna wake up,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.500]   and you're gonna be like, "I don't feel anything."
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.620]   And what your pagan friends are gonna say,
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.220]   "I've fallen out of love.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:02.820]   "I married the wrong person.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.120]   "And I'm not saying that it's gonna stay that way.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.060]   "I don't know."
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.220]   I'm just telling you, feelings come and go.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.820]   And if you don't know what you're looking for,
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.660]   you won't find it.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.860]   So we're in this series, Fortune Telling,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.180]   where we're looking at what the scripture
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.100]   says about our future, how it informs it.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.800]   And what I wanna talk about this evening
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.940]   for the few minutes that I have you
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.280]   is who you should marry.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.240]   Magic eight ball, who am I gonna marry?
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.580]   God, who should I marry?
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.340]   And I'm gonna give you a verse from the scripture.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.860]   I'm gonna be in 1 Timothy chapter four,
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.060]   if you wanna turn there.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.540]   I'm gonna give you an amazing list from the scripture
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.900]   of who you should marry.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.460]   And who should I marry is really who to look for.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.220]   It's really who to date.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.420]   But it's honestly, guys, listen, it's who to be.
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.100]   Because I'm sure you've heard here before,
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.020]   if you've been here long,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.300]   you wanna become someone
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.200]   that someone you're looking for is looking for.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.580]   You wanna be someone that someone you're looking for
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.420]   is looking for.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.020]   So this message tonight, regardless of where you're at,
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.420]   whether you're seriously dating,
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.620]   single, never been asked out, you desire marriage,
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.140]   maybe you're called to singleness,
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.820]   if it's not who should I marry, then it's who should I be?
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.500]   I should become this person
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.780]   because this is what the scripture informs us.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.440]   And let me just start with an apology up front.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.340]   The church, big C church, has missed it.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.380]   And I'm sorry, as a pastor and a leader of a local church,
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.380]   I want to ask your forgiveness
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.820]   because the church has made this tremendous mistake
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.460]   in the 21st century of elevating marriage above singleness.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.620]   And that's an unbiblical, anti-biblical idea.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.660]   That's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.980]   The Bible teaches that singleness is a gift.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.780]   And you're like, I roll moment, does it have a receipt?
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.620]   Can I return it?
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.700]   Can I exchange it for what kind of gift is it?
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.580]   No, but it's a gift.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.180]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.980]   And so I promise you what's true about it,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.340]   it is a gift.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.820]   That's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.660]   verse seven.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.020]   And Paul, the apostle who was single,
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.980]   who wrote 80% of the New Testament,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.240]   is plagiarizing the words of Jesus in Matthew 19,
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.660]   when Jesus says, "There are some who are celibate
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.920]   "for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.300]   "Not everyone can accept it, but those who can should."
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.820]   So Jesus, who was also single and 33 years old,
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.820]   elevates the calling of singleness on par with marriage.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.020]   And so if you're single, it's okay.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.580]   You're not second class, you're not junior varsity,
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.500]   you're not JV, you have this tremendous calling
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.980]   on your life like Jesus.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.720]   And we don't know if it's for a day or for a year
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.300]   or for 20 years or a lifetime.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.100]   We don't know, none of us can see the future.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.100]   But if you desire marriage, this is who you should look for.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:54.740]   I'm telling you who you should look for.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.300]   And the way that we find, how do we find someone to marry?
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.120]   What do we do?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.720]   It's not rhetorical, what do we do?
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.400]   We go on Tinder.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.760]   No, no, no, what do we do?
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.280]   Bumble, no, no, no, what do we do, what do we do?
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.400]   We date, yeah, we date.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.360]   We date, thank you, David.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.200]   You're listening.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.040]   Thank you.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.040]   You date, this is dating, it's a modern idea
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.280]   and it's our method of trying to find a suitable spouse.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.100]   That's why we date.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.440]   You're trying to find a suitable spouse.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.320]   Now, that's not what the world says.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.160]   The world says date for fun, date for the feels,
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.360]   date to experience the opposite sex,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.440]   date for the experience.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.680]   Dating is about 120 years old.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.880]   It entered the English language
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.360]   as a euphemism for prostitution.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.560]   Think about this, guys.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.440]   Prior to 120 years ago, no one in the history of the world
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.840]   had ever gone on a date.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.240]   Crazy.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.320]   Before 120 years ago, no one had gone on a date.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.680]   That wasn't a method.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.200]   That was invented 120 years ago
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.440]   and it enters the English language
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.240]   as a euphemism for prostitution
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.480]   because to go on a date was to exchange
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.640]   an experience for sexual favors.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.040]   Now, if you think about how we date in the 21st century,
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.120]   in the world, we haven't come that far.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's still very much how the world dates.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   We exchange an experience.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.120]   Take me to my favorite restaurant.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.000]   Give me my favorite drink, favorite appetizer.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.760]   Let's go, we're talking.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.440]   And maybe you'll get lucky somehow, some way.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   That's how the world dates.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.200]   I mean, just call it, saying like it is.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.080]   You guys are staring at me like, wait, is he serious?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.680]   Yes, that's what your friends do.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.200]   I know not you, guy, we're in church.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.760]   I'm saying that's what people do though, right?
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:44.200]   And we have more help than we've ever had.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.040]   We've got dating apps, dating websites,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.720]   personality tests, compatibility tests,
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   professional matchmakers, and we're the worst at marriage
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.000]   than any generation in the history of history.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.040]   What happened, what's wrong?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.640]   People are sliding into DMs, they're ghosting each other.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.280]   We don't, we're not sincere in our love,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.440]   like Romans 12, nine says.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.320]   We do what we wanna do, we're cowards, we hide.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.560]   We hide behind technology.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   We basically outsource this whole thing to a web developer.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.800]   And you're left brokenhearted,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.680]   and I know a lot of you have cried yourself to sleep.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.520]   Probably most of you have cried yourself to sleep.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.920]   And guys, I wanna ask you a question.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.160]   I've been spending a lot of time in this book.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.620]   What if our hearts weren't meant to be broken?
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.640]   What if God didn't make breakable hearts?
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   What if he never intended for your heart to be broken?
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.960]   And in reality, we're getting married later,
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.200]   we're getting married less, and marriages aren't lasting.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.560]   And so if dating is the pathway to the promise of marriage,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.800]   we're doing something wrong.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.240]   And I'm just here, I'm raising my hand,
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.480]   and say, hey, something's gotta change.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.320]   And so what I'm gonna say tonight is crazy in some ways,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.480]   but just apply logic and grab God's word,
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.600]   and prove to me, if you can,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.680]   from the word of God that I'm wrong.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.220]   'Cause I'm really just plagiarizing some truths
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.520]   that were written.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.960]   I'm really just gonna give you one verse
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.720]   with a lot of supporting verses tonight.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.040]   But let me give you some stats up front.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.600]   1967 out of 10 people in their 20s were married,
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.720]   compared with just two out of 10 today.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.760]   For the first time in history,
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.560]   the average American now spends more years
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.320]   single than married.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.880]   About 50% of marriages end in divorce.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.360]   Now, let me say that 50% is made of 41% of first marriages,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.820]   60% of second marriages, and 73% of third marriages.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.240]   So a lot of different things that make up that stat.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.560]   But let's just say you say, no, no, I think it's 40%.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.860]   Let me tell you something.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.940]   Most marriages fail miserably.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.000]   That's the truth.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.400]   Most marriages fail miserably.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.480]   Because of those that stay married,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.660]   there's a bunch of them that are unhappily undivorced.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.100]   Like, this is some of your parents.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.320]   They don't love each other, they're not intimate, right?
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.800]   They're celibate or they're unfaithful.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.720]   They're roommates.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.500]   Sometimes they sleep in separate rooms or separate beds,
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.340]   and they're not happy.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.760]   So they're not divorced, but they're not happy.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.280]   So the smallest demographic is people
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.980]   who are joyfully married and stay married and stay joyful.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.580]   That's the smallest demographic.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.860]   Here's what I want you to know.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.700]   Here's why I left my family tonight.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.820]   Here's why I drove two hours to be here,
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.560]   is because I want that to be every single person
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.020]   who desires marriage, I want that to be you.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.900]   And I believe it's available to you
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.500]   if you will lean into the word of God
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.420]   for the next few minutes together.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.980]   That you could be joyfully married
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:44.460]   for the rest of your life.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.580]   Good.
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:47.420]   - I love it.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.240]   - Good.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.880]   So I'm gonna give you five things.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.500]   Five things to look for.
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.460]   Because I think one of the greatest problems
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.200]   is people don't know what to look for,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.860]   and you cannot find it if you don't know
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.420]   what you're looking for.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.260]   So I'm gonna give you five things.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.320]   This is a great list.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.720]   This list was not preserved for dating.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.580]   Dating was nowhere in the Bible, believe it or not.
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.860]   The internet's nowhere in the Bible.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.940]   It wasn't invented yet, right?
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.140]   And so the Bible does not speak to dating.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.700]   It does speak to relationships.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.140]   And it does speak to discipleship.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.340]   Tonight's a discipleship message.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.700]   These five things is what the Apostle Paul tells Timothy,
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.260]   hey, this is what you should do.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.580]   This is what you should be.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.380]   Be an example of this, Timothy.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.820]   Timothy, also single.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.100]   Paul, single, writing to Timothy, who's single,
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.420]   who says this, verse 12.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.580]   "Don't let anyone look down on you because you're young."
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.780]   Well, we read that and we think,
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.060]   oh, is he 16, is he 14, 13?
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.860]   He's older than most of you.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.060]   He's about 40 years old when he writes this.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.080]   Yeah, I know, crazy.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.100]   It's good news for me that the Bible says that's young.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.980]   "Don't let anyone look down on you because you're young,
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.700]   "but instead, rather, set an example
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.660]   "for the believers in speech."
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.280]   You see five things, speech, conduct,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   in love, in faith, and in purity.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.660]   Give you five questions to ask.
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.900]   You're on a date, these are the five questions you ask.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.140]   Because all you're doing on a date
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.380]   is you're trying to find, will there be a suitable spouse?
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.660]   So you're trying to have experiences
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.940]   that would allow you to see and determine
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.480]   if they would be a great husband or a great wife,
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.700]   a great mom or a great dad.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.820]   That's all you're trying to do.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.620]   And you wanna do that as quickly and effectively
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.580]   as you possibly can, because dating's the interview,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.460]   it's not the fun part.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.920]   It's like the challenges of marriage
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.820]   without the fun stuff, right?
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.140]   And so the first question,
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.120]   do they set an example in their speech?
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.160]   That's the first question.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.060]   Do they set an example in their speech?
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.900]   Now this is huge.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.600]   This is much more important than you think it is.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.000]   Here's another way to ask it.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   What do they say?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.560]   What comes out of their mouth?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.720]   Do they gossip?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.800]   Like I was on a date with a girl prior to Monica.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.360]   And the only thing that she wanted to talk about
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.720]   is everyone who wasn't there.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.320]   Like going on a date with her was like being
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.860]   in the grocery store aisle and looking at all the tabloids.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.700]   Did you know?
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.520]   Did you know?
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.360]   Did you know?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.180]   Did you know he?
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.020]   Did you know she?
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:12.860]   Did you know they?
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.440]   Like we had nothing else to talk about.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.400]   That's the ungodly.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.640]   That's a giant red flag.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.940]   If you're on a first date with someone
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.880]   and they want to talk about someone who's not present,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.200]   that's not a good sign.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.140]   What comes out of their mouth?
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.720]   Do they tear people down?
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.640]   Guys, man.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.080]   Marriage is hard.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   Some of you need to hear that,
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.680]   but some of you need to hear marriage is good.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.520]   Marriage is good.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.340]   Singleness is good.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.180]   It's good.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.020]   It's a good thing.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.400]   The Bible calls it, says marriage is good,
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.540]   but it's also hard.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.380]   After a long day of work,
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.000]   after a lot of challenges in ministry,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.360]   I walk through that door, praise God.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.680]   I married a cheerleader.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.520]   Praise God.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.900]   And I don't mean cheerleader like you think I mean.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.740]   I mean that she says,
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.080]   "Hey, I just want to remind you that God loves you
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.320]   "and that he's good and that he's in control
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.180]   "and that you got this and you can keep going
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.000]   "and I'm here for you.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.480]   "I want you to know that."
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.320]   Right?
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.400]   Are they negative?
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.720]   Guys, marriage is hard.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.960]   If they're negative, that's a beat down.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.000]   Like that's gonna be a lot more difficult
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.760]   to partner up in ministry with someone
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.800]   who's always negative.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.120]   Do they curse in anger?
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.320]   James 1:19, like what comes out of their mouth
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.020]   when they're squeezed?
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.280]   Not when they're sitting across the table from you
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.040]   at their favorite restaurant,
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:36.980]   ordering their favorite food.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.320]   What comes out of their mouth when they're squeezed, man?
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.520]   Like when they slam their finger in the car door.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.020]   What comes out of their mouth?
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.680]   Because that's what's gonna show you what's in their heart.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.160]   This is what Jesus says in Luke 6.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.600]   "A good man brings good things
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.120]   "out of the good stored up in his heart
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.640]   "and an evil man brings evil things
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.240]   "out of the evil stored up in his heart.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.800]   "For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of."
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.220]   What comes out of their mouth?
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.920]   You want to know what kind of heart they have?
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   Look at their words.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.480]   I'm walking to the porch one day,
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.280]   I mean totally about to preach
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.520]   and this dude walks by and I'm thinking,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.200]   you know, porchy, awesome, and I'm like,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.920]   "Hey, buddy," and he goes, "Get the F away from me."
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.480]   Oh, wow, not a fan, I get it, you know, okay.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:25.440]   I say, "Hey, man, everything okay?"
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.040]   He goes, "Leave me the F alone."
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:31.920]   I go, "Hey, buddy, I don't want to get dirty
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.760]   "before I preach, dude."
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.000]   Like, what, no, I'm kidding, I didn't say that.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.440]   I was like, "Hey, everything," I was like,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.960]   "You all right, man, you okay?"
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.520]   He goes, "I'm looking for the F in hospital."
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.680]   I go, "Well, you're in the wrong place."
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.760]   And he goes, "What?"
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.520]   I go, "Yeah, it's in the hospital."
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.120]   I was like, "This is a church."
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.600]   And he's looking for a medical city, like down the road.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.320]   I say, "Hey, I'm literally, I'm like 10 minutes
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.600]   "from meeting," I'm like, "Hey, get in the car,
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.160]   "I'll take you there," and I zip him down,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.000]   dump him off at the ER, right, and you know,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.160]   like good Samaritan kind of like leaves, no.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.800]   Anyway, so leave him there, come back, preach,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.240]   the hospital is closed afterwards,
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.720]   so go back the next day, check on him.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.360]   What had happened is his appendix had ruptured, right?
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.800]   Spewed evil all throughout his, I mean evil,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.260]   spewed poison all throughout his body.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.720]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.240]   Poison all throughout his body,
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.880]   and because there's poison inside of him,
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.520]   there's poison coming out of him, right?
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.080]   Because as I asked if he was a Christian,
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080]   he's like, "Oh yeah, I'm a Christian."
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.680]   I'm like, "That's really confusing, man, based on,"
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.040]   you know, and as I clarified the gospel,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.600]   it turns out he wasn't a Christian,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.240]   and he called himself a Christian.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.220]   But when he was displaying the things in his heart,
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.680]   you wanna know what comes out of their mouth
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.480]   when they're squeezed,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.040]   and so you wanna create an environment
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.060]   so that you can see what comes out of their mouth
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:45.900]   when they're squeezed.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.040]   What I'm saying is you want to, you know,
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.480]   slam their finger in the car door,
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.440]   so no, I'm kidding, don't do that.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.380]   But think about how can I see that, right?
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.920]   Because their words show their hearts,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.800]   and that their actions are gonna follow their words,
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.640]   and that's number two,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   do they set an example in their conduct?
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.480]   Do they set an example in their conduct?
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.320]   Here's how I would ask this.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.180]   What is their reputation?
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.140]   What is their, 'cause reputation is a lot of conduct
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.560]   stacked on top of each other over time,
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.480]   not just a Taylor Swift album.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.280]   Like, it's what they've been doing for a long period of time
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.040]   and this is what the scripture says,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.320]   Proverbs 20, verse 11,
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.900]   "Even small children are known by their actions,
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.760]   "so is their conduct really pure and upright?"
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.140]   What are they known for?
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.560]   And this is one of the challenges of online dating,
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.120]   and I'm not completely against it
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.280]   'cause the Bible isn't completely against it.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.380]   I would just say be wise,
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.000]   and there's two rules to online dating, okay?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.880]   Rule number one, profiles lie.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.200]   Like, anybody can be anyone on the internet.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.020]   They can graduate from seminary and pastor a church
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.680]   and memorize a bunch of scripture
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.800]   and not even be a Christian.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.800]   Profiles lie.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.480]   Rule number two, and this is a big one,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.440]   this is the one that's gonna upset you.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.340]   Don't go on a date with strangers.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.280]   Like, I take questions on Friday,
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.480]   this deal called Friday Q&A,
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.240]   and yeah, me and you.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   And I get about 2,000 questions every Friday,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.140]   most of them on relationships,
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.960]   and one that I see about 10 times every Friday is,
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.560]   how do I, when I'm on a date,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.120]   how do I figure out if he's a believer?
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.600]   Guys, listen, lean in, man.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.200]   Long before you're on that date,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.680]   sitting at a table with some dude,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.400]   know if he's a believer or not.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.760]   And you say, "Well, how do I find that out?"
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.900]   Check references.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.800]   Like, not all online dating is created equal.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   I would, if I'm gonna do that,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.460]   I'm gonna go through the platforms
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.680]   that allow me to see common friends
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.840]   so that I can say, "Hey, do you know this guy?
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   "Do you know where he goes to church?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.840]   "Where does he serve?
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.040]   "Is he really running hard after Jesus?
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.400]   "Do you know her?
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.660]   "Is she solid?
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.280]   "What friend group does she hang in?"
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.280]   Check references prior to going on that date
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.440]   because here's why.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.120]   Past performance is the best indicator
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.280]   of future performance.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.120]   You understand?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.440]   Past performance is the best indicator
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.680]   of future performance.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.920]   A friend of mine was doing a wedding
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.960]   and the day before the wedding,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.480]   the ex-wife shows up and says,
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.280]   "Hey, you know that he was arrested for physical abuse?"
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.200]   And my wife's like, "No, I didn't know that.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.960]   "That never came up in the pre-marital counseling."
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.920]   And they're like, "Yeah, he was arrested."
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.960]   And my friend, so they sits down with both of them
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.760]   and say, "Hey, did you know he was arrested
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   "for physical abuse?"
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.960]   And she was like, "No, I didn't know that."
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.500]   And he was like, "Oh, you know, she's crazy
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.800]   "and that's not exactly what happened."
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.060]   And my friend's like, "Yeah, but it seems like
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.640]   "you should've said that."
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.880]   And so I'm uncomfortable doing the wedding.
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.040]   When you mess with people's wedding,
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.560]   they get really upset.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.920]   They were so mad.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.840]   Like they left, so they're like,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.000]   "Hey, we're not getting married here."
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.640]   They go somewhere else, they go to another church,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.960]   they find another pastor, they get married.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.880]   They go on the honeymoon and it's amazing
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.560]   as a lot of honeymoons are.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.720]   They come back from the honeymoon,
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.480]   he throws her to the ground and breaks both of her arms.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.160]   You know?
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.600]   And listen, people do change.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.680]   That's what you're asking right now.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.960]   Some of you are sitting next to each other,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.120]   you're like, "Baby, I swear I'm different."
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.520]   People, people, I don't mean to make it awkward,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.320]   I'm just saying I saw some elbowing.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.360]   People do change, right?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.800]   But you want a track record of faithfulness, right?
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.320]   You want their repentance.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.720]   My friend Todd says this all the time.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.800]   You want their repentance to be as notorious
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.760]   as their rebellion.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.400]   That they're using their mess and that that's their message
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.920]   and they're leveraging that because they're different.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.960]   They're not hiding it in the closet.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.280]   They're like bringing it out for everyone to see
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.440]   that's this who I was, but Jesus changed me.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.400]   My wife, I got her this Suburban, bought her this Suburban,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.600]   but it had been wrecked really badly.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.120]   And the fact that it was in that bad accident
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.960]   prior to us purchasing it kept everyone else away
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.280]   and they had to discount it a lot.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.320]   That's the only kind of vehicle I buy
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.840]   is the deeply discounted kind.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.280]   And so it was like majorly, majorly on sale.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.120]   And it kept everyone else away,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.240]   but here's why it didn't keep me away
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.840]   because I saw that after the wreck that it was repaired
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.440]   and they had been on the road faithfully for three years
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.160]   without any breakdowns.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.240]   And I'm like, hey, I trust it
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   because there's a track record of faithfulness.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.240]   I know you're not buying a car,
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   but you're looking for a spouse.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.840]   You want a track record of faithfulness.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.720]   And not just how they act with you
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.280]   because with you they're on the interview.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.200]   Observe them when they're with somebody
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.160]   that can do nothing for them in return.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.360]   How do they act towards someone
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.160]   who can do nothing for them in return?
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.240]   Because how they act will point to what they love.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.160]   And that's the number three.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.120]   Do they set an example in love?
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.200]   Do they set an example in love?
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.880]   What do they love?
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.440]   Do they love football?
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.520]   Do they love the Mavericks?
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.360]   Do they love money?
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   Do they love children?
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.960]   Do they love their shih tzu?
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.720]   That's a dog.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.400]   What do they love?
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.680]   And it's okay if they love things,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.400]   but as you look at that list,
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.120]   you're gonna start to see their idols.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.840]   And you wanna make sure that the greatest obsession
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.880]   of their life is the creator of the heavens and the earth,
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.160]   through his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.880]   What do they love?
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   When Jesus was on the earth, he talked about this.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.760]   In fact, he summarized 644 laws of the prophets
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.040]   into two of the greatest commandments.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.920]   And this is what he said, because it's about love.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.280]   So listen, he said, Jesus replied,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.000]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.280]   "and with all your soul and with all your mind."
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.680]   This is the first and greatest commandment.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   And the second is like it, love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.240]   Do they love God?
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.720]   And do they love people?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.600]   You're going to want to identify
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   the affections of their heart.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.880]   And here's how you do that.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.240]   'Cause you're like, well, how do I do that?
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.520]   One, what comes out of their mouth.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.360]   But two, where do they invest their time,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.040]   talents, and treasures?
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.400]   Because that will show you what has their heart.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.800]   Jesus says in Matthew six,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.080]   where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.920]   So wherever they're investing time,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.680]   wherever they're spending money,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.560]   wherever they're using their gifts,
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.760]   that's going to show you the objects of their heart.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.900]   Is that, like are they serving in the nursery?
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.120]   They love church, hey, I'm going on mission trips.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.960]   I'm always with God.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.520]   I got community tonight, can't hang, sorry.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.720]   No, I'm reading the Bible.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.840]   I woke up this morning.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.280]   Can't wait to get into God's word.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.120]   Or are they like, man, the masks are on.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.000]   Call you later.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.920]   Don't interrupt me.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.880]   What do they love?
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.800]   I talked to this young adult here one time.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   Right here, he's like, man, yeah, dude, I love,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   man, I love this play, I love God.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.480]   Love God.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.000]   Me and God, man, love it.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.800]   I'm like, oh, that's good, man.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.640]   What's he teaching right now?
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.360]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.160]   Lean not on your own understanding.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.040]   In all your ways, acknowledge him,
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.600]   and he will make your path straight.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.440]   I love God.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.800]   Proverbs 3, five and six, man.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.640]   That's cool, man, that's great.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.800]   You got any other verses?
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   I love the Proverbs, especially chapter three.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.560]   Love God.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.400]   I was like, that's cool, man.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.160]   So where are you being instructed right now?
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.840]   Like, where do you go to church?
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.280]   Nah, nah, nah, church, that's not really my thing.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.760]   The institution, you know, it's all corporate and stuff.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.360]   That's not my, it's me and Jesus.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.200]   Like, I love God.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.280]   Like, it's just me and God.
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.480]   I love God.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.960]   You know, oh, yeah, you don't really,
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.040]   so you're not a part of a church.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.960]   No, man, I'm not in a church.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.240]   You know, that's just not how I do,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.240]   like, me and God, that's not what we do.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.240]   And besides, the Cowboys play on Sunday,
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.560]   and I got this spot, like, where my boys,
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.840]   like, we go, it's Hellgate.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.760]   It's kind of an all-day affair.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.000]   And, you know, it's evangelistic, right?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.800]   Evangelical, you might say.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.520]   We go, and I'm like, it's a place
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.840]   where we just hang out all day.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.200]   And I'm like, oh, and we talk more.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.640]   And it turns out, this is what I told them,
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.480]   'cause this is where we went.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.440]   I said, oh, I do think you love God,
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.600]   and the Cowboys are your God, right?
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.800]   You're fooling yourself.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.040]   You have a greater obsession than the creator
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.720]   of the heavens and the earth, so let's just be honest.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.640]   And it's not just what do they love, friends,
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.920]   it's how do they love.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.120]   Do they lead people better than they found them?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.800]   Can I talk about checking references?
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.720]   Like, when their ex, all their exes
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.560]   are just really angry at them,
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:56.320]   like, they created TikTok sites just to bash them,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.000]   like, they're so hurt by them.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.120]   That's, like, you're probably gonna be one of those exes.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.320]   That's their track record.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   You want to date someone who leads people
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.920]   better than they found them, and that is possible.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.840]   It is possible.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.320]   I know that's different than how the world dates,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   but it is very, very possible.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.200]   And so what environments will show you what they love most?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.080]   That's where you want to go,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.440]   because what they love will point to what they believe,
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.720]   and what they believe, that's their faith,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.480]   and that's number four, do they set an example in faith?
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.880]   What do they believe?
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.880]   I'm not saying, do they identify as a Christian?
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.360]   That's a different question.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.080]   I can identify as a giraffe.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.960]   It does not make me a giraffe.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.200]   Like, I can say that I'm anything, right?
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.600]   But that doesn't make me that thing.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.760]   I'm saying, have they trusted fully?
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.720]   Listen, lean in, this is the important part.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.320]   Had they fully given themselves to the death
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.280]   and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.840]   for the forgiveness of their sins,
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.680]   not in some kind of check the box,
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.320]   oh, when I was six years old, I went down to the front,
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.640]   I said a prayer, and it has had no impact
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.800]   on my life since then.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.600]   I'm talking about, are they running hard after Jesus?
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.560]   Like, do they love him?
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.120]   Does their life display that they are madly in love
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.960]   with the one who literally, quite literally died for them
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.000]   to save them from hell?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.960]   Does that mark their lives?
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.080]   And that's the gospel, that's the good news.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.440]   2 Corinthians 6:14 says,
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.640]   "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers."
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.920]   Do not date someone thinking you can change them.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.720]   You're not a dating missionary.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.120]   That is not your spiritual gift,
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.560]   and it is not the calling on your life, okay?
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.640]   You date someone who has radically given their heart
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.400]   to the Lord, and you be that person.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.680]   Like, you're in a church on a Tuesday night.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.480]   That's a really good sign.
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.320]   It doesn't mean everything, it just means at least,
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.640]   you're headed in the right direction.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.160]   Even if you came here because you wanna disprove
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.680]   Christianity, like, you don't understand what's happening.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.560]   God has unleashed the hounds of heaven after you,
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.080]   and he's gonna win, it's gonna be awesome.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.520]   I'm so glad you're here.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.600]   You know who you are.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.920]   And, right, you want to find someone
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.360]   who's in love with God.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.520]   And I'll just tell you, like, as a dude who's done
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.960]   a lot of marriage counseling,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.720]   and a lot of pre-marriage counseling,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.800]   it's half the battle.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.960]   Man, they have the Jesus thing, right?
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.720]   It covers a multitude of sins.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.600]   Like, if you just find somebody who is radically
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.680]   in love with Christ, like, not check the box
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.800]   kind of world, lukewarm Christian, cultural Christian,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.760]   no, I'm not talking about that.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.120]   I'm talking about somebody that just delights in God.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.400]   Like, you're gonna be fine.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.040]   If you're that and they're that.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.360]   Did you know that there's never,
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.120]   let's talk about a 50% divorce rate.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.720]   You know there's never been a divorce
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.800]   between two people pursuing Jesus?
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.000]   You know it's never happened in the history of the world?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.520]   There has never in the history of creation
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.680]   been a divorce between two people
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.560]   who were running hard after Jesus.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.920]   It's never happened.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.760]   So if you just be that and you find that,
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.800]   you're gonna be fine.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:21.240]   That's more than half the battle.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.600]   I love what Tommy Nelson says.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.720]   You probably have heard this at some point.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.600]   He's just the person that I heard it from first.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.640]   But it's like you're running a marathon, you know?
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.480]   And it's like you're serving over here
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.160]   and you look around and say, oh yeah,
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.440]   you're there serving, you're always with me.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   And then you go over to Africa or Haiti,
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.480]   you do a mission trip and you're in this marathon,
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   you're running over there and you're like,
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.160]   oh yeah, it's you again, we're always together.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.960]   And you're hanging out with these Christians here
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.560]   and you're running, you're like, oh, there we are again.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.960]   You know, you're in the marathon,
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.400]   the person who's serving the nursery
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.840]   with the kids at the church, oh yeah, it's you again, huh?
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.400]   And you're going to church, you look over,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.360]   ah, there you are.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.440]   And every, you're in that marathon.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.880]   And at some point, like we've been running together
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.720]   for a while, huh?
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.600]   Hey, you wanna run together forever?
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.440]   Awesome.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.920]   And you're like, no, that's stupid.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.240]   No, that's beautiful.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.120]   And it happens.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.840]   And when it happens, it's amazing.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.040]   It really does happen.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.360]   Half the battle is where you look, friends.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   So like, you know, people are like, oh yeah, no, we met.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   We met on Tinder and that's, you can, it happens.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.240]   Well, we met, no, we met at the bar, we were in Uptown.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.720]   It's possible.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.040]   And there might be a Christian in there, it's possible.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.360]   Like, I can find a Christian book in Barnes & Noble.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.600]   Like, I can go to Barnes & Noble
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.640]   and there's a Christian section.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.960]   And some of the books in that section
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.280]   are actually Christian, right?
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.120]   But if you blindfolded me and you sent me into Barnes & Noble
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.480]   and you said, grab a book, like, it's probably
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.200]   not gonna be Christian because the vast majority
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.000]   of books in there are not Christian.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.080]   But if I go to Mardell's, you know, or Lifeway,
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.920]   rest in peace, if I go to a Christian bookstore,
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.560]   if I go to a Christian bookstore, right,
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.880]   and you blindfold me, you send me in there
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.160]   and I grab a book, there's a good chance
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.920]   it's gonna be a Christian because half the battle
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.000]   is where you look, where you're spending your time.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.480]   Like, that's a big part of finding someone you should marry.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.120]   And I know you're looking for the one,
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.160]   and so I just always have to say
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.560]   this public service announcement, right?
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.280]   There's not a one, it's not one,
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.400]   you're not star-crossed lovers.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.160]   There's somebody created about the same time you were
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.480]   and you guys were separated and you gotta roam
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.160]   throughout the earth finding this person
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:35.000]   that God in His sovereignty has identified for you
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.560]   and so you're really interviewing people
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.840]   based on how you feel to determine if they're,
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.160]   that comes from Greek mythology.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.800]   It's the belief that Zeus, that everybody was two people
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.400]   and he cut them in half and he separated their halves
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.520]   and you have to go and find the half, find your soulmate.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.080]   That it comes from pagan mythology.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.380]   It's unbiblical, you're not looking for the one,
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.960]   you're looking for someone.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.660]   You're not roaming throughout the earth
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.040]   trying to find the one, you're looking for someone
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.640]   who knows who formed the earth, okay?
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.080]   Like, and the good news is, right,
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.760]   it's not just a needle in a haystack,
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.120]   like it's really a group of people.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.480]   It's relatively a small group of people
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.240]   who God has their heart.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.760]   And in that group of people, there's a lot of them
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.320]   that you could make an amazing marriage with.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.800]   Like Monica and I found each other,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.160]   she's the one for me because we promised before God
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.280]   that we would stay together.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.400]   That makes her the one.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.600]   Is there someone better for her than me?
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.120]   Not rhetorical.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.460]   Yes.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.660]   She's five two, I'm six foot seven.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.580]   I mean, I like guns, motorcycles, and the UFC.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.860]   She doesn't like any of those things, right?
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.940]   But it's okay.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.740]   Like, yeah, there's lots, there's probably hundreds
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.760]   of thousands of guys that she's more compatible with.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.980]   But she's mine, I got the girl.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.460]   Take that, guys.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.680]   Their faith will help set the pace
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.080]   in them living a pure life.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.520]   It's a life marked by purity.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.320]   And that's the fifth question.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.960]   Do they set an example in purity?
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.240]   Do they live a pure life?
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.200]   Do they value pure thinking?
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.360]   The word there for purity, it's not just sexual purity,
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.380]   it's really moral cleanliness.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.160]   It goes beyond physical.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.800]   It's like, what are they feeding their hearts?
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.360]   Like, if they get most of their relationship advice
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.200]   from the bachelor, like, that's problematic.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.400]   You know, like, if that's what they're training their heart,
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.500]   they're going to a university for divorce.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.240]   Like, they're training themselves for divorce.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.500]   So you wanna look at, like, what are they entertained by?
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.260]   Are they entertained by the things that Jesus died for?
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.400]   I think so often we're entertained and amused
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.440]   by the things that held Jesus on the cross.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.240]   You know, are they committed to purity?
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   Purity in the sexual sense is refraining from extramarital
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.120]   or especially from all sexual intercourse.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.980]   And here's why that matters.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.240]   Because remember, you're looking for someone
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.120]   who's committed to Christ.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   And the guy that would tell you that he loves you,
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.040]   but he's moving his hand anywhere other than a ring box,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.660]   is saying something.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.880]   Let me tell you what he's saying.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.800]   Listen, lean in.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.560]   He's saying, God, I'm not scared of you.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.640]   What are you gonna do to me?
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.360]   Now, listen here, God, I'm gonna do what I wanna do
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.280]   when I wanna do it.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.240]   I'm gonna follow my feelings.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.040]   When I feel like having my way with someone,
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.120]   that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.320]   I'm not afraid of you.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.520]   Proceed with caution.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.860]   You understand?
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:40.380]   Proceed with caution.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.680]   Because that person is telling you something else.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.760]   And it's really important that you listen to this.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.120]   They're communicating something to you.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.240]   This is what they're saying.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.760]   They're saying, I do not value the marriage covenant.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.680]   I'm willing to go outside of the marriage covenant
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.560]   for sexual intimacy.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.280]   And you need to know something.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.720]   Should we get married?
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.560]   I'm telling you right now,
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.680]   I'm willing to go outside the marriage covenant
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.040]   for sexual intimacy.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.800]   I don't value it.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.680]   That's important.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.480]   You know, the divorce rate, or I'm sorry,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   the infidelity rate of people who've been primarily impure
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.800]   is astronomically higher than those who haven't.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.000]   Okay?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.940]   This is what they're communicating to you.
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.760]   I don't value the marriage covenant.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.440]   I've done a lot of weddings.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.640]   I mean, I've seen the ones that work out,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.080]   the ones that don't.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.720]   You know, I've been to a lot of weddings.
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.080]   I've stood up here on this stage
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.640]   and looked at the thousands of you for 12 years.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.440]   You think I haven't had literally thousands
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.860]   of conversations up there?
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.340]   I've heard everything you can possibly imagine.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.860]   I don't say that out of arrogance,
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.300]   but maybe just to earn an ounce of credibility,
[00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.460]   to say this, sometimes when I do weddings,
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.820]   every wedding you've ever been to,
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.260]   there's this part, you know that part where they say,
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.300]   you may kiss the bride, remember that?
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.580]   You may kiss, do you know why they say that in marriages?
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.100]   In weddings, rather?
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.060]   You know why they say that?
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.940]   Because for most of history, that was their first kiss.
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.740]   You may kiss the bride.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.060]   Like, now you're married, you may kiss your bride.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.300]   And their friends and family would observe, right?
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.900]   And today, that sounds crazy.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.940]   Like, it's like, you may kiss the bride.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.780]   We've seen you kiss.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.700]   We've seen you make out a thousand times, you know?
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.580]   You may kiss the bride,
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:27.420]   but I've actually done weddings of people,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.400]   that's their first kiss.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.620]   You may kiss the bride, and that's their first kiss.
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.140]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:31.980]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.860]   You know what's crazy?
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.000]   That their marriage is amazing.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.500]   That's crazy.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.060]   They have incredible marriages.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.040]   And it sounds so crazy to us,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.420]   but their hearts haven't been broken,
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.420]   they haven't cried themselves to sleep.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.140]   And in that marriage covenant,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.660]   they know, hey, I've fought for purity.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.480]   You better believe I'm not going outside of this
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.580]   for anybody else.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.240]   Somebody can come up to me and hit on me
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.380]   and buy me a drink and say,
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.580]   I can be traveling for business,
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.560]   but you know I've fought for this.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.760]   And it's safe, right?
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.620]   People ask how close, or how far is too far, you know?
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.700]   The question, how far is too far?
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.660]   And I would just say, well,
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.820]   it's like asking how close to the edge can I get
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:20.740]   of a building, like how close can I get?
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.560]   I would just ask, like, do you wanna jump off?
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.780]   'Cause if you wanna jump off the building,
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.940]   don't get close to the edge.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.380]   I think when it comes to intimacy in relationships,
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.980]   if we were honest, we all wanna jump off.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.420]   So don't get on the elevator.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.620]   But I'm gonna give you a better answer than that,
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.700]   how far is too far.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.740]   Here's the answer.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.780]   When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.860]   you've gone too far.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.060]   When your body begins to prepare itself for sex,
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.180]   you've gone too far.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.860]   And so to explain this, so you understand what I'm saying,
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.420]   I'm gonna bring out a whiteboard, no, I'm kidding,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.220]   I'm not gonna do that, okay?
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.380]   You know what I mean, you know what I'm saying
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.100]   when I say that, when your body begins to prepare itself
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.420]   for sex, you've gone too far.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.900]   And this is what the scripture says.
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.400]   Flee sexual immorality.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.580]   All other sin a person commits are outside the body,
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.220]   but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body,
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.900]   this one's different!
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.220]   He's saying that.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.620]   This sin is different.
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.180]   It hurts you in a different way.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.780]   Whoever sins in sexual immorality,
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:20.620]   sins against their own body,
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:22.460]   do not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.420]   who is in you, whom you've received from God,
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.340]   you are not your own, you've been bought by a price,
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.580]   therefore, honor God with your body.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:29.900]   He's saying, hey, you know that body?
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.820]   It's not your body.
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.300]   You have it on loan.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.340]   You ever loan somebody something?
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.700]   Like your roommate borrows your shoes or something?
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.260]   You get 'em back, the heel's broken,
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.100]   or your Jordan's and the bubble's popped or something,
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.940]   you're like, dude, what did you do, right?
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.380]   You ever loan somebody something, a dress,
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.760]   then it comes back, like that's frustrating
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.860]   when you give somebody something.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.740]   Monica and I had this bounce house
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.020]   that we bought for the kids,
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.460]   and it was more than we would normally spend,
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.860]   but we just said, hey, we're gonna do this
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:00.140]   because we're gonna lend it out freely.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.540]   Like anybody that wants to borrow the house, bounce house,
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.700]   we're gonna let 'em, so it's like for birthday parties.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.820]   But when somebody would come and get the bounce house,
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.820]   like I would have a list of rules
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:09.560]   because it's my bounce house.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.900]   I would say, hey, like only three kids at a time,
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.620]   make sure that it's connected to this kind of outlet,
[00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.900]   make sure that this tube stays straight,
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.740]   and make sure that you put it in the ground firmly.
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:23.500]   And so when that person, somebody borrowed it one time
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.580]   and they brought it back, it had a giant rip in it,
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.540]   it was frustrating.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.620]   I forgive you, but it was frustrating, you know?
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:32.980]   Because they used it in a way
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.780]   that it wasn't intended to be used, right?
[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.900]   It wasn't their bounce house.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   And they used it in a way that it wasn't intended to be used.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.420]   In summary, 1 Timothy 4:12.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:52.160]   Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young,
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.620]   but set an example for believers in speech.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.540]   What do they say?
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.760]   In conduct, what is their reputation?
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.100]   In love, what do they love?
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.940]   In faith, what do they believe?
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.000]   And in purity, do they live a pure life?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.400]   My wife, she'll send me to the grocery store
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.020]   every now and then, like with a list,
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.240]   and she gives me this list, like milk, eggs, cheese,
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.800]   whatever, and it's like, parenthetically,
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.200]   she's real specific, okay?
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.840]   Because she knows I'm gonna get the cheapest stuff,
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.500]   like I'll come back, kill country fair all day,
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.020]   like just cheapest, biggest bargain stuff I can find.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.940]   So she'll say milk, right?
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.240]   But parenthetically, she'll say 2% organic,
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.920]   one gallon, blue label, blue cap, this brand, you know?
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.140]   And that's what it says in the parentheses, like milk,
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.160]   and she's like, and don't you dare come home
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.140]   without this specific kind of milk, right?
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.240]   So as I'm walking through the milk aisle,
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.560]   as I'm walking through the milk aisle,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.660]   I'm looking at her list, trying to find an example
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.220]   that matches her description.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:58.060]   And when I find it, 2% organic, one gallon,
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.820]   blue label, blue lid, this brand,
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:04.200]   what I don't do is I don't open the freezer and think,
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.080]   how do I feel?
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.400]   Like, do we have chemistry, me and the milk?
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   No, I found what I'm looking for, so I commit to it.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.260]   There's no, oh, I just know and I know,
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.920]   like, hey, babe, how do I know which milk to get?
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.000]   You'll just know when you know.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.880]   No, I'll know when it matches what you told me to look for.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.060]   Don't you see?
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.960]   That's when you're gonna know,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.480]   that you just, you look, and you look at them,
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.000]   and you're like, wait, but what about chemistry?
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.040]   Isn't that important?
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.240]   It has a place.
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.440]   It's not ultimate.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.840]   It's not most important.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.760]   It's not first, second, third, fourth important.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.640]   Chemistry comes and goes.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.680]   I can create chemistry.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:48.700]   You know, you can manufacture that.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.200]   If you don't believe me, like, watch a lot of shows.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.760]   That's what they do.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.560]   Document, I mean, that's truly, that's what they do.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.420]   Great, you've had chemistry with people
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.760]   that you're no longer with.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.920]   I love the resolve of my friend Marshall.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.680]   I know.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.480]   I love, I love just the pragmatism
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.520]   that he approaches life with,
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.120]   because he gets to this point out of college,
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:11.960]   and he thinks, you know what?
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.440]   It's time for me to get married.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.660]   And he says, so now I'm looking for a wife,
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.660]   so I'm gonna go to this young adult ministry,
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.040]   and I'm gonna get involved there, and I'm looking around.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.980]   And he sees somebody that when she speaks,
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.760]   she builds people up,
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.600]   and that her conduct is one that other girls wanna follow.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.040]   She's investing in them.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.380]   She's pouring in them.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.140]   Right?
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.740]   And the way that she loves, and the things that she loves,
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.300]   the way that she spends time in God's word,
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.180]   the way that she's serving in that ministry,
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.580]   it shows her heart, that she has a heart for the Lord,
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.620]   and her faith, that Jesus is the biggest,
[00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:53.580]   most important thing about her,
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.440]   and that she is relentlessly committed to purity.
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.540]   And so he goes to her, and he's like,
[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.480]   you match the description of what I'm looking for.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.060]   Like, he's not the most romantic guy,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.020]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.660]   Like, he's not singing "Boys to Men" and lighting candles.
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.220]   That's just not his game, you know?
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:15.140]   That's my game, honestly.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:16.140]   That's not his game.
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.580]   He's just like, you match what I'm,
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.980]   like, look, do you wanna get married?
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.220]   I mean, we can date a couple times if you want,
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.300]   but I mean, you're what I'm looking for, right?
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.100]   Dudes, I gotta talk to you before I'm done.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:28.940]   I'm done.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.580]   There's so many godly women around you,
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.180]   and pornography has messed you up, man.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.940]   It's taken you, and it's trained you,
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.260]   and I know it's a girl problem, too,
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.060]   but it's trained you to look for all the wrong things.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:48.820]   You got five things that you're looking for.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.780]   Find someone that has those five things,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.000]   and put a ring on it.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.940]   But be those five things.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.260]   Be those five things first, okay?
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:00.340]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.540]   Father, we love you.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.820]   We thank you for your word that it doesn't return void.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.300]   We thank you for just a simple verse
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.820]   that gives us five things to look for
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:08.980]   in who we should marry.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.940]   Would you press that deep into our soul?
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.540]   God, I pray that there is not a divorce
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.140]   that comes out of this room,
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.060]   that people who are called to singleness in this room
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.780]   would find contentment in it,
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.740]   and people who are called to marriage
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.660]   would find a suitable spouse
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:30.900]   that sets an example in their speech
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.860]   and in their conduct and in their love
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.580]   and in their faith and in their purity,
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.260]   and that healthy marriages would be born in this room,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.740]   and ministry would be strengthened
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.180]   because we're really just looking for a partner in ministry,
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.220]   that that's what would happen,
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.820]   that we would meet somebody
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.660]   that we can make disciples with and get after it.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.920]   Help us not to learn from Hollywood, God.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.380]   We know that Hollywood has the highest divorce rate
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.140]   of anywhere in America,
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.020]   and they should not be the ones instructing us
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.540]   on what to look for in a spouse.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.260]   You should, God, we wanna listen to you.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.180]   We wanna learn from you.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.940]   Help us to unlearn what we need to unlearn.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:08.980]   And Father, would you make us new, give us new hearts,
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:11.100]   help us to learn what we need to learn.
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.060]   In the name of Jesus, I pray.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:16.400]   (whooshing)
