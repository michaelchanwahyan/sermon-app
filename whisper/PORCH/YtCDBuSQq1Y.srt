1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 (drum roll)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,800
 But as I've met and I've shared the gospel with people,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,120
 and as I've talked, in fact, just last week,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,480
 I was talking with an angry atheist,

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,600
 a humanist, he called himself.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,440
 And I'm sharing the gospel,

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,480
 and I'm sharing the historical facts,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
 and I'm sharing every great apologetic I know

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,120
 to show him evidence that there's a creator God

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,280
 who sent his son 2013 years ago,

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,280
 an event that reset the calendar to this earth.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,360
 And I'm sharing with him every piece of wisdom

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,160
 and literature I've read, every fact I know,

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:51,000
 archeological, historical, biological, scientific.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,280
 And I just say this, I say, hey,

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,120
 you know that God loves you, man.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,640
 You know God loves you, he's crazy about you.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
 And he said, oh yeah.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,680
 He said, well, if God loves me,

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
 then why do I live with chronic back pain?

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,600
 He said, if God loves me,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,280
 then why do I gotta live with this, man?

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,040
 And I gotta tell you, I hear that all the time.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,360
 If God is real, then why am I going through this?

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,360
 Breakup, job loss, death, funeral, mourning, sorrow,

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,280
 sadness, depression, despair.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,760
 What is going on if God loves me?

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,600
 And it seems that if someone's doubting God,

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,800
 they doubt one of two things.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,560
 They either doubt that one, he is good,

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
 or two, that he's powerful.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,840
 He's either not good, but he's powerful.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,480
 Or he's either good, he just doesn't,

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,600
 he's just not powerful.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,360
 He's just not powerful.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,200
 And I'm here to tell you this evening that God,

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,920
 the creator of the heavens and the earth,

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
 the one who displayed his power

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,400
 as his first act in the scriptures,

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,320
 he said and it was, who creates with his voice,

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,320
 he is both very, very good.

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,960
 He is absolutely good, and all power is his.

43
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,080
 He is all powerful.

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,800
 That is the God we just sang to.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 That is the God that we worship.

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,040
 And he is in authority.

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,600
 Tonight as we move into Ecclesiastes 8,

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,400
 Solomon is going to talk to us about wisdom under authority.

49
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,720
 These are chapters around what does it look like

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,680
 to apply wisdom to a broken world?

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,800
 What does it look like to be wise in a world

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,680
 that is unbelievably broken?

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,440
 And specifically in this chapter,

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,480
 he's gonna talk about how can you be wise under authority?

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,600
 And that's relevant because all of us are under authority.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,480
 And I've met people who don't like to be under authority.

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,080
 Right, I've seen people over and over and over in my day

58
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,600
 who rebel against authority.

59
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,040
 In fact, I've been that person in seasons.

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
 And it does not end well for that person.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
 In fact, usually, statistically,

62
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,400
 that person ends up in one of two places,

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
 on the streets or in prison.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,560
 On the streets or in prison.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,240
 Maybe not, like maybe they just go through life

66
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,640
 in absolute despair because authority is a fact.

67
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,560
 We all exist under authority.

68
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,440
 And so tonight, we're talking about wisdom under authority.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,720
 We're moving through a series called Vanity and Experiment.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,120
 Solomon is king, he has a lot of authority.

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,040
 He's the most powerful person in the land.

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,840
 He wrote this book to us.

73
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,480
 He's talking about how to be wise in a broken world.

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,200
 And he says this, verse one.

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
 Who is like the wise?

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,520
 Who knows the explanation of things?

77
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,040
 A person's wisdom brightens their face

78
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,800
 and changes its hard appearance.

79
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,640
 He starts off this chapter just saying,

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,300
 hey, one of the great things in life is wisdom.

81
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,720
 Last week in chapter seven,

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,740
 we were talking about wisdom.

83
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,760
 Solomon says, hey, one of the great things in life

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,520
 that you can obtain is that you would be wise.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,660
 And so we're just gonna talk about wisdom under authority,

86
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,000
 our place under authority, dealing with corrupt authority,

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,960
 and then before you leave here tonight,

88
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,960
 how we can have peace in a crazy,

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,600
 jacked up, messed up world,

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,500
 trusting in God's authority, his absolute authority.

91
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
 Let's go, verse two.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,880
 Obey the king's command, I say,

93
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,400
 because you took an oath before God.

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,560
 Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence.

95
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,400
 What does he say?

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,120
 He says, hey, guys, the king tells you

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,560
 when the meeting's over.

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,240
 You don't say when the meeting's over.

99
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,600
 The king, who has authority, he tells you,

100
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,200
 he gets to decide when the meeting is over.

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
 Do not stand up for a bad cause,

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,780
 for he will do whatever he pleases.

103
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,920
 The Hebrew, more accurately, would say,

104
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,440
 he can do whatever he pleases.

105
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,880
 Since a king's word is supreme,

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,560
 who can say to him, what are you doing?

107
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,440
 Who can say to the king, what are you doing?

108
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,800
 He's setting us up down a path.

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
 He's asking a rhetorical question,

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
 implying that you can't, but someone can.

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,440
 That God can.

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,640
 He's gonna take us down this path through this text.

113
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,680
 Whoever obeys his commands will come to no harm,

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,040
 and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,520
 He says, hey, you can gain wisdom in dealing with the king.

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,960
 If you are wise in the heart,

117
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
 like we talked about in Ecclesiastes 7,

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
 you will know how to deal with the king,

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,940
 both the good king and the corrupt king.

120
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,600
 We need to gain wisdom,

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,700
 for there is a proper time and procedure for every matter,

122
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,980
 though a person may be weighed down by misery.

123
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,020
 In summary, he just says in this section,

124
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,780
 the king is in charge, you are not in charge.

125
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,420
 Obey the king.

126
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,500
 He puts us in our place.

127
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,780
 That's one of my first point this evening,

128
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,540
 is just that we need to know that we are under authority.

129
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,740
 You and I, we are under authority.

130
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
 There is an authority.

131
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,780
 There is someone that we answer to over us,

132
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,740
 who is not just God.

133
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,100
 People say all the time, I say, who do you answer to?

134
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,780
 They say, God, God alone.

135
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,720
 Have you read the scriptures?

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,300
 God has placed people in authority over you.

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,540
 It says it very clearly in the Bible,

138
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,980
 over and over and over.

139
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,340
 And so we're to obey the king.

140
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,380
 What's the exception?

141
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,780
 When do we not obey the king?

142
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,180
 We don't obey the king when his authority contradicts

143
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,040
 with our absolute authority under God.

144
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,120
 That's it.

145
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,580
 It's that simple.

146
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,540
 But we respect the king.

147
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,640
 We show honor to the king.

148
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,100
 The governing authority, the authority's over us.

149
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,480
 And so who is authority over us?

150
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,660
 There is, of course, the government.

151
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,780
 That's the example that Solomon gives us right up top.

152
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,340
 And so Solomon saw this.

153
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,100
 Solomon now is a part of the government.

154
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,820
 Solomon is king, but Solomon's dad was David.

155
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,540
 Do you guys remember the story of David?

156
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,620
 David was the shepherd boy anointed by Samuel to be king.

157
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,520
 The king at the time was a man named Saul.

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,580
 Saul looked like a king.

159
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,060
 David did not look like a king.

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,140
 Saul was king.

161
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,900
 Saul was the Solomon of that day.

162
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,780
 He was the powerful man in the land.

163
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,320
 And Saul is jealous of David.

164
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,160
 Why?

165
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,820
 Because jealous, because David slayed a bunch of people.

166
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,580
 Saul's jealous.

167
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,980
 David's hiding in caves.

168
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,300
 In an incredible story that just shows how amazing God is

169
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,940
 and how just incredible he is in his sovereignty,

170
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,500
 Solomon goes in the cave that David's sleeping in

171
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,820
 to relieve himself.

172
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,380
 Number one, number two, I don't know.

173
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,140
 But he goes in there, okay.

174
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,300
 David creeps up on him and can take him.

175
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,500
 But he says, no, man, this is God's anointed.

176
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,100
 It's not my place.

177
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,060
 David could kill the one who is after him,

178
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,020
 but instead he just cuts off a piece of his robe.

179
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,980
 And he moves on.

180
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,700
 He says this, he says,

181
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,140
 I won't lift my hand against God's anointed.

182
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,540
 Really powerful story.

183
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,860
 Paul says this in Romans 13,

184
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,300
 that we're to obey governing authority.

185
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,380
 Romans 13, verse one, the whole chapter really is on this.

186
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,700
 He says, let everyone be subject

187
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,080
 to the governing authorities.

188
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,780
 For there is no authority except that

189
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,620
 which God has established.

190
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,380
 The authorities that exist have been established by God.

191
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,340
 That's a really important idea for us.

192
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,900
 Because I think in our core,

193
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,300
 we all want to be these vigilantes.

194
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,860
 We all want to try to overthrow the government

195
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,700
 at some point.

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,820
 I don't know what that looks like for you.

197
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,700
 It may just look like awkward forwards

198
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
 that your dad sends you about the president or something

199
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,380
 that it'd be perpetuated.

200
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,620
 No, not just my dad, huh?

201
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,060
 Okay, and so, here's the deal, man.

202
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,180
 That's not what people who follow Jesus do.

203
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,460
 We don't perpetuate that stuff.

204
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,220
 We submit to our governing authorities,

205
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,020
 unless, right, unless in fact they ask us

206
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,900
 to do something that contradicts our absolute authority,

207
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,740
 which is God.

208
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,660
 That's the role we play.

209
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,500
 It's interesting that Paul wrote that, Romans 13,

210
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,620
 he wrote that to the church in Rome,

211
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,180
 who was actually, the powers that be,

212
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,100
 the emperor of Rome was actually burning Christians alive.

213
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,700
 And Paul says, obey them.

214
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,040
 And so, here's how I make that practical for you.

215
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,140
 Make sure you pray for your government

216
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,900
 more than you complain about them.

217
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,140
 Okay, make sure you're praying for your leaders

218
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,260
 more than you're complaining about them.

219
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,940
 Another authority over us is, of course, the church.

220
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,940
 We are to subject ourselves, everyone in this room,

221
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,540
 this is really important for you,

222
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,180
 particularly 20s and 30-somethings,

223
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,900
 because we tend not to like this.

224
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,920
 Everyone in this room, everyone under this roof,

225
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,700
 is under the authority of the church.

226
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,600
 You should be a member somewhere.

227
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,060
 You should belong to a local church.

228
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,020
 That's biblical.

229
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,740
 It is the single most powerful force in the world.

230
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,300
 It is God's plan for the world,

231
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,860
 the gospel moving through his bride, the church.

232
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,380
 And so, if you wanna yoke yourself

233
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,400
 to the most powerful force this world has ever known,

234
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,700
 the best thing that you can do, beyond trusting in Christ,

235
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,340
 is to become a member of a Bible-teaching church.

236
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,500
 Hebrews 13, 17 says this.

237
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,100
 It says, have confidence in your leaders

238
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,800
 and submit to their authority,

239
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,920
 because they keep watch over you

240
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,900
 as those who must give an account.

241
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,900
 Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden,

242
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,300
 for that would be of no benefit to you.

243
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,700
 You are to subject yourself to church authority.

244
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,900
 Another authority applicable to our life stage is work.

245
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,560
 We are to submit ourselves to the authority over us,

246
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,460
 our boss.

247
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,340
 The Bible has a lot, the Scriptures has a lot

248
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,660
 to say about this, and so here's what I would say here.

249
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,540
 Make sure you contribute more than you complain.

250
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,720
 If you have the Holy Spirit residing in you,

251
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,440
 if you are a Christian,

252
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,480
 you should be the best workers on the force.

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,520
 Okay, hands down.

254
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,240
 You are working not for man, but for the one true God,

255
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,900
 the creator of the heavens and the earth.

256
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,960
 You should be the best employees there.

257
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,600
 That's a fact.

258
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
 Titus 2, one of my favorite verses, 9 and 10 says this.

259
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,500
 Teach slaves, that's us, to be subject to their masters,

260
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,480
 that's our bosses, in everything.

261
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,780
 To try to please them, not to talk back to them,

262
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,440
 and not to steal from them,

263
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,980
 but to show that they can be fully trusted,

264
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,400
 so that in every way, they will make the teaching

265
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,160
 about God, our Savior, attractive.

266
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,760
 We are to make the teaching about God, our Savior,

267
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,360
 attractive, that is why you work there.

268
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,760
 Don't I work there to make a ton of money?

269
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,920
 I hope you do.

270
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,280
 I hope you make a ton of money.

271
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,120
 But you work there to make the teaching of God,

272
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,760
 your Savior, attractive, that's why you're there.

273
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,480
 Okay, but don't I have to like it?

274
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,040
 No, you have to make the teaching of Jesus attractive.

275
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
 That's why you're there.

276
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
 And so you subject yourself to the authority.

277
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,520
 Had a weird experience in the corporate world.

278
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,060
 I worked for a telecom company,

279
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,180
 one of the largest companies in the world.

280
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,680
 I say that to just, it was a big company, lots of avenues,

281
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,800
 lots of, you know, tracks you could run within the company.

282
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,360
 I was a national account manager,

283
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,920
 and above me was the global account manager section.

284
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,600
 I wanted to be, everyone who was a national account manager,

285
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,280
 wanted to be a global account manager.

286
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,080
 That's where you go and you can work forever and retire.

287
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,640
 That's where you wanna be, okay?

288
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,360
 That was kind of the pinnacle within the organization.

289
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,280
 I had heard rumors that there might be an opportunity

290
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,880
 for me to interview with the global accounts.

291
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,560
 And so I was very excited about that, okay?

292
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,200
 The time came, the day came, they said,

293
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
 "Hey, JP, would you like to interview

294
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
 "for this position within global accounts?"

295
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,720
 Yes, I would.

296
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,560
 I'd been with the company about three years.

297
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,680
 And so I put on my navy suit, my white shirt,

298
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,400
 my power tie, my resume.

299
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,580
 I drive over to the building to interview for this position

300
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,640
 and I sit down with the director over global accounts.

301
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,920
 I'm really excited, okay?

302
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
 I really, really, really want this job.

303
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,520
 And he begins to talk to me, he starts out very cordial.

304
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,360
 "What's your name?"

305
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,180
 "Jonathan Cluta."

306
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,020
 "Hey, this is what I've done,

307
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,860
 "this is some of the, you know,

308
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,720
 "how long I've been with the company,

309
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
 "these are some of the successes I've experienced."

310
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
 Yada, yada, yada, so forth.

311
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,060
 And then he says, "Hey, Jonathan,

312
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,760
 "I've had the opportunity to read an email that you wrote,

313
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,840
 "and I would describe it at best as unprofessional."

314
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,180
 Oh man, that's not good.

315
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,200
 (congregation laughing)

316
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,800
 Yeah, man, at best unprofessional.

317
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,640
 He's starting to get angry, I'm like, okay.

318
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,480
 And he says, he said, and so I'm like,

319
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,320
 "Well, what was it about?"

320
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
 He goes, "Here's the deal, there was a customer

321
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,160
 "that was going from national accounts to global accounts,

322
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,620
 "and you told them that that was not best for them,

323
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,600
 "so I'm sitting here wondering why you wanna be a part

324
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,520
 "of global accounts when you told the customer

325
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,420
 "that global accounts wasn't the best place for them.

326
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,560
 "Why would you say that when we both know that it is?

327
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,000
 "I just really need to understand why you wrote this email."

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,280
 And I'm thinking, oh, this was a setup, okay.

329
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,400
 This guy is just angry, this isn't a real interview.

330
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,920
 He just wants to take out this on me about this email,

331
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,800
 and I'm thinking, oh no, what email was it, okay?

332
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,360
 And I was like, just like, I don't remember

333
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,720
 what customer was it, I mean, it's not crazy,

334
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,140
 that's, I mean, I could've done that, I don't know.

335
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,880
 He says, "You need to tell me why you would write

336
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,120
 "such an email."

337
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,640
 I'm like, oh man, okay, I don't know.

338
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,360
 I said, this is what I said, and this was kind of

339
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
 profound wisdom in this time.

340
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
 I never forgot what he said.

341
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,820
 I said, "Well, it's possible that my boss asked me

342
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
 "to send that email, they don't like losing accounts,

343
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,720
 "and so maybe they asked me to send that email,"

344
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,320
 which was not, which is a terrible response,

345
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,040
 but I'm just blaming the boss, but,

346
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,200
 so this is what he says.

347
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,960
 He didn't miss a beat, he's a smart guy.

348
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,800
 Didn't miss a beat, he goes,

349
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,240
 "Let me tell you something."

350
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,860
 He goes, "You know what, sometimes our bosses

351
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,640
 "ask us to do something that we shouldn't do.

352
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,300
 "I get that, you can respond in one of three ways.

353
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,520
 "You can one, do it, you can two, not do it,

354
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,080
 "or you can three, say, hey, I'm willing to do it

355
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,820
 "under your authority, or, but may I humbly suggest

356
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,340
 "another way?"

357
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,620
 And I just thought, man, I never forgot that.

358
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,820
 I have three things, man, that makes sense.

359
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,040
 Do it, not do it, humbly suggest another way, I got it.

360
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,060
 Okay, and so then, just in a moment of clarity,

361
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,400
 a Holy Spirit moment, I kind of, I was like,

362
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,820
 I mean, he was pushing me around.

363
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,860
 I kind of bowed up a little bit, I said,

364
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,700
 "You know what?

365
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,460
 "You know what?

366
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,920
 (congregation laughing)

367
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
 "That's right.

368
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,640
 "I want to tell you why I sent that email.

369
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,520
 "I don't remember the email.

370
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,980
 "If you really want to know why I sent it,

371
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,420
 "and I assume you do, 'cause you seem really,

372
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,820
 "really angry right now, you're gonna have to get the email,

373
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,660
 "and I'll tell you why I sent it."

374
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,220
 He goes, "I absolutely will!"

375
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,820
 Okay, calm down.

376
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,140
 He gets on the polycom, he calls Mark.

377
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,860
 "Mark, what was that customer, or can you get that email

378
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,180
 "that JP sent to that customer in national accounts

379
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,700
 "about not wanting to go to global accounts?"

380
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,780
 Silence.

381
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,420
 Mark says, "You mean AJ?"

382
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,940
 (congregation laughing)

383
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,380
 He goes, "No!

384
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,500
 "JP, the customer that went from national accounts

385
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,840
 "to global accounts, you know the one!"

386
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,660
 Mark goes, "No, that was AJ."

387
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,000
 (congregation laughing)

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,340
 I said, "Not me!"

389
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:51,080
 And I just said, "Oh man, I could see how that

390
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,520
 "would be really frustrating."

391
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,880
 (congregation laughing)

392
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,320
 That's something, frankly, that I would never do,

393
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,800
 and that's what was confusing about that whole deal.

394
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,520
 And it's interesting, here's why I tell you that.

395
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,840
 Here's why I tell you that.

396
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,800
 He said, he laid it, we're friends now,

397
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,920
 things have changed, and he hired me,

398
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,400
 and he said the reason that he hired me

399
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,080
 was because how I responded in that situation.

400
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,480
 And I remember that, I remember the situation

401
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,680
 like it was just one of those pivotal moments in life,

402
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,960
 it's the job, it's like the job I really, really wanted.

403
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,760
 And he said, "Hey man, the way that you, you know,

404
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,100
 "you just sat there, you calmly navigated that situation,

405
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
 "you respected the authority over you,

406
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,320
 "even when I was acting like a tyrant."

407
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,440
 I said, "Man, I'll bring that guy on."

408
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,520
 And so, there's a place, man.

409
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,480
 You can do it, you can not do it.

410
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,840
 You can say, "Hey man, I will,

411
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,760
 "but may I humbly suggest another way?

412
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,620
 "Let's go."

413
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,280
 So what about when the authority over you is corrupt?

414
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
 What about when it's just bad authority?

415
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,800
 What about when they're crazy, man?

416
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,280
 Here's what I want you to know, my second point

417
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,960
 is that corrupt authority is a reality.

418
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,320
 Man, you just need to know that, man.

419
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,780
 We live in a broken world, and there is corruption,

420
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,660
 and corrupt authority is just a flat-out reality.

421
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,280
 There are people who are powerful, but not good.

422
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,120
 Remember we said God is absolutely good

423
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,600
 and absolutely powerful?

424
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,960
 That's a great equation, that should come to your peace.

425
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,080
 That equals your peace, it's a great math equation.

426
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,000
 There are people who are powerful, but not good, right?

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,140
 And there are people who gain authority

428
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,480
 because they're really, really driven or wicked,

429
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,640
 or you know, their daddy didn't hug 'em enough

430
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,360
 or something, and they get to the top,

431
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,040
 and they're just ready to flex on some people, okay?

432
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
 They're just ready to show you their power

433
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,480
 to their own demise.

434
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,460
 This is what he's gonna talk about, verse seven.

435
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,300
 Since no one knows the future, who can tell someone else

436
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,140
 what is to come?

437
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,340
 What he's saying is, hey, leaders have limits, right?

438
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,100
 There are limitations of leaders.

439
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,260
 So who knows the future?

440
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,780
 But, let me ask you this, who does know the future?

441
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,180
 Remember, he's taking this down a path

442
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,300
 of rhetorical questions.

443
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,220
 There is someone who knows.

444
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,780
 But he's saying, hey, the leader over you, he doesn't know.

445
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,260
 He doesn't know the future.

446
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,060
 As no one has power over the wind to contain it,

447
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,340
 someone does, so no one has power

448
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,980
 over the time of their death.

449
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,920
 As no one is discharged in your time of war,

450
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,080
 so wickedness will not release those who practice it.

451
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,160
 He starts to paint this picture that evil and wickedness

452
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
 is this perpetuating thing.

453
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,500
 It's this evil that you get stuck in.

454
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,720
 When you're evil and you do evil deeds,

455
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,360
 all of a sudden you find yourself in the midst

456
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,680
 of lots of evil people and evil practices,

457
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,760
 and your life gets consumed by wickedness,

458
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,400
 and there's never enough, and you just kind of,

459
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,080
 your life is given over to it.

460
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,240
 This really happens, we see this happen.

461
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,460
 People getting stuck in evil.

462
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,260
 All this I say as I applied my mind

463
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,140
 to everything done under the sun.

464
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,140
 There is a time when a man lords it over others

465
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,860
 to his own hurt.

466
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,420
 Is this true?

467
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,020
 Or is there people who they have authority

468
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,820
 and they lord it over others to their own illness,

469
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,860
 to their own sickness, to their own weakness,

470
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,980
 to their own brokenness?

471
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,020
 I think of Scarface.

472
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,960
 Have you guys seen Scarface?

473
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,940
 No, you should not have seen Scarface, okay?

474
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,700
 I saw it B.C., okay?

475
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,420
 (congregation laughing)

476
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
 True story.

477
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,080
 And so at the end of the movie, right,

478
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,340
 he just has all of this power,

479
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,020
 he's sitting there with his machine gun

480
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,540
 killing everyone, you know, hopped up on cocaine,

481
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,500
 and he just thinks he's invincible.

482
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,460
 He's not, he's about to die.

483
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,260
 But this happens.

484
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,500
 Maybe not exactly like that,

485
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,300
 but it happens in corporate America in similar ways, right?

486
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,980
 Then too I saw the wicked buried,

487
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,520
 those who used to come and go, listen to this,

488
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,640
 from the holy place and receive praise in the city

489
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,780
 where they did this, this too is meaningless.

490
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,580
 Did you hear that?

491
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,900
 There's wicked people who go to and from the holy places.

492
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,540
 He's saying, man, you can't trust everyone in church.

493
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,740
 I'll go one step further and I'll say,

494
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,860
 you can't trust everyone with a microphone

495
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,460
 stacked to their face, or a pulpit, or a Bible open.

496
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,900
 Now there's some wicked dudes out there.

497
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,580
 Some really, really wicked dudes out there

498
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,720
 fronting with the Bible, fronting with the scriptures.

499
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,080
 He's talking about this.

500
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,800
 Also, another idea you can pull from this text

501
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,060
 is a lot of times evil people are very religious.

502
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,040
 A lot of times wicked people,

503
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
 it's like a really superstitious thing.

504
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,600
 Even in their wickedness, they acknowledge

505
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,240
 there is an authority over them,

506
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,960
 and they try to go through the superstition

507
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,960
 so that they can continue in power.

508
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,380
 You may see that in your office.

509
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,080
 When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out,

510
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,720
 people's hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong.

511
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,100
 He's saying, hey, when the authority over us

512
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,460
 does not practice justice, crimes multiply.

513
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,080
 When the people who are in authority

514
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,960
 do not bring others to justice,

515
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,680
 people begin to do more and more and more wrong,

516
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,960
 more and more crime.

517
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,160
 Although a wicked person who commits 100 crimes

518
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,720
 may live a long time, I know that it will go better

519
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,320
 for those who fear God, who are reverent before him.

520
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,580
 Yet because the wicked do not fear God,

521
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,080
 it will not go well with them,

522
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,240
 and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.

523
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,200
 He starts to say, hey, man,

524
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,640
 it may look like bad people win,

525
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,480
 but they still go to hell.

526
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,320
 There's still a God over them.

527
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,760
 That's not something we gloat in,

528
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,640
 but justice is the Lord's.

529
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
 Revenge is the Lord's.

530
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,120
 He said, hey, it may look like bad people are getting ahead.

531
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,960
 No, they're not.

532
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,760
 You need to change your backdrop to an eternal backdrop.

533
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,680
 They do not win, okay?

534
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,160
 They go to hell, and those who are under the authority

535
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,840
 of Jesus Christ go to heaven.

536
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,580
 Now tell me, who won?

537
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,240
 Who got the better end of the deal?

538
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,120
 Like somebody gets a little bit of success on earth,

539
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
 and then they go to hell.

540
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,560
 Somebody struggles on earth, wrestles on earth,

541
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,080
 experiences sadness and despair on earth,

542
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,920
 but they get to go be with God forever and ever

543
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,840
 and ever and ever and ever in his paradise.

544
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,680
 Who won?

545
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,720
 There's something else meaningless that occurs on earth.

546
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,440
 The righteous who get what the wicked deserve,

547
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,480
 and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve.

548
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,960
 This too, I say, is meaningless.

549
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,180
 Okay, in that whole section, he's essentially saying,

550
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,160
 hey, corrupt authority is a fact,

551
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,800
 and we need wisdom to deal with it.

552
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,200
 And he starts to paint this picture like,

553
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,080
 yeah, man, there are righteous people.

554
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
 Like just because you worship God,

555
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,980
 just because you love God,

556
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,500
 it doesn't mean you're gonna be wealthy.

557
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,600
 That's a lie.

558
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,760
 And just because you don't worship God,

559
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,320
 just because you don't know God,

560
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,480
 it doesn't mean you're gonna be sad all the time.

561
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
 That too might be a lie.

562
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,160
 Like good things happen to bad people,

563
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,540
 and bad things happen to good people,

564
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,680
 but we gotta change the backdrop to an eternal backdrop,

565
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,660
 because it puts everything in perspective.

566
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,220
 It changes everything.

567
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,180
 And so it may seem like people are getting away with evil,

568
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:55,600
 but you must trust the one who rules all authority, right?

569
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,680
 And I'll tell you, people rarely get away with evil.

570
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,120
 Like there's a time where Hitler

571
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
 was one of the most powerful men in all of the world,

572
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,960
 and he thinks he's getting away with it.

573
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,140
 I mean, when he's got armies and armies and armies

574
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,640
 of people doing what he said,

575
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,480
 he thinks he's getting away with it.

576
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,320
 The dude shot himself and then was drug out and burned,

577
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,100
 right there on the spot.

578
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,720
 He did not win.

579
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,080
 It did not go well for him.

580
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,480
 You guys remember Saddam Hussein?

581
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,080
 You guys might not remember this.

582
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,660
 Like Saddam Hussein was a very, very wealthy man,

583
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,600
 lots of women, lots of gold, lots of palaces,

584
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,040
 lots of property.

585
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,580
 He was a very powerful man.

586
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,120
 They found him in a hole, hiding from everyone.

587
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,540
 He died by execution.

588
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:48,280
 Osama Bin Laden, one of the most sought after men

589
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,340
 in the world, the most wanted man on the face of the planet,

590
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,320
 he can't even see the sunlight.

591
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,800
 He can't even go outside.

592
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,040
 Evil did not win.

593
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,740
 But sometimes it does, man.

594
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,800
 Sometimes it looks like it's getting ahead here.

595
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,000
 Sometimes the guy who cheats in companies

596
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,080
 makes his way to the top.

597
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,100
 Man, you just need to know that.

598
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,820
 Sometimes that happens.

599
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,420
 Sometimes he gets ahead by cheating.

600
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,960
 Sometimes it looks like he wins, man.

601
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,080
 He may die laughing.

602
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,040
 I don't know, he may die of old age,

603
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,780
 laughing, counting his money, man.

604
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,480
 You still gotta deal with God.

605
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,320
 There's still one who is an ultimate authority,

606
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,740
 and so we need wisdom.

607
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,960
 Proverbs 9, verse 10 says,

608
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,300
 "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,

609
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,920
 "and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."

610
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,460
 He says, "You wanna gain wisdom

611
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,180
 "in regards to dealing with authority?

612
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,760
 "You understand the one who is an ultimate authority,

613
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,700
 "the one who ultimately has all authority.

614
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,520
 "Every other authority you know

615
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,460
 "operates under his authority."

616
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,860
 Let me show you from the scriptures.

617
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,700
 That's my third point,

618
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,840
 is know that all authority is under God's authority.

619
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,700
 So I commend the enjoyment of life.

620
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,140
 Solomon says, "Hey, sometimes you win,

621
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,380
 "sometimes you lose.

622
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,660
 "Bad people get ahead.

623
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,300
 "This is what you need to do."

624
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,400
 Have a good time, man.

625
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,860
 Eat, drink, and be merry.

626
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,240
 Because there is nothing better for a person under the sun

627
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,160
 than to eat and drink and be glad.

628
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,180
 Then joy will accompany them in their toil

629
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,800
 all the days of the life God has given them

630
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,900
 under the sun.

631
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,220
 When I applied my mind to know wisdom

632
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,180
 and to observe the labor that is done on earth,

633
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,060
 people getting no sleep day or night,

634
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,980
 and then he says, verse 17,

635
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,420
 "Look, then I saw all that God has done."

636
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,220
 No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun.

637
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,060
 Despite all their efforts to search it out,

638
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,860
 no one can discover its meaning,

639
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,660
 even if the wise claim they know,

640
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,360
 they cannot really comprehend it.

641
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,340
 But there is someone who knows.

642
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,220
 This is what this text is teaching us.

643
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,960
 All these rhetorical questions have actual answers.

644
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,280
 There is someone who can see the future.

645
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,600
 There is someone who controls all authority.

646
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,960
 There is someone who knows the end of your days.

647
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,980
 Your days are numbered.

648
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,080
 He knows, and all authority is his.

649
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,080
 He is an absolute, ultimate authority, even now.

650
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,940
 God is in control of everything.

651
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,520
 And so you are free to live your life trusting him,

652
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,440
 both the bitter life and the sweet life trusting him.

653
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,560
 Wisdom begins at understanding all that God can do

654
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,940
 and all that he has done.

655
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,900
 Here's the fact, man, it's a fallen world.

656
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,480
 This is what I was writing when Greg,

657
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
 I literally was writing this message.

658
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,180
 Greg called me right here.

659
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,820
 It's a messed up world, man.

660
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,420
 Like Satan is the ruler of this world,

661
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,640
 it says in the scripture, the ruler of this age.

662
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,800
 He's the prince of air, it says in the scripture.

663
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,720
 And he speaks lies and all he wants to do is take you out.

664
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
 He hates that you know the creator

665
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,480
 of the heavens and the earth.

666
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,680
 But it's not a dualistic theology that's not accurate.

667
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,460
 It's not like there's God and there's Satan.

668
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,100
 No, there's God and Satan is under him, even.

669
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,840
 Like Satan battles from a position of defeat

670
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,680
 under the authority of the one true God,

671
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,820
 the creator of the heavens and the earth.

672
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,160
 We see this all throughout the scriptures.

673
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,840
 You see it in Job when Satan comes to God.

674
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,880
 May I mess with him?

675
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
 No, no, no, I think God says, hey, everyone.

676
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,320
 I think if I mess with Job, he'll turn from you.

677
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,840
 We see this in the scriptures

678
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,640
 that Satan is asking God for permission.

679
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,560
 Jesus goes up to Peter and he says,

680
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,120
 hey, Satan asked to sift you like wheat.

681
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,040
 Dude, that's a weird conversation.

682
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,540
 (congregation laughing)

683
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,880
 Yo, Jesus, I'd like to sift Peter like wheat.

684
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,340
 (congregation laughing)

685
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,380
 Jesus told Peter, I'll pray for you.

686
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,220
 I'd be like, Jesus, why didn't you just tell him no, man?

687
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,140
 (congregation laughing)

688
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,980
 Just go back and say no, he can't sift me like wheat.

689
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,060
 Let's end that deal, right?

690
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,420
 Remember Jesus to Pilate?

691
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,160
 Pilate's there, like Jesus is about to be crucified.

692
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,940
 He says, hey, I can kill you.

693
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,860
 And Jesus says, you have no authority,

694
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,860
 you're not given by my Father.

695
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,840
 Guys, this should give you some peace, man.

696
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,020
 This should give you some peace.

697
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,740
 God is powerful, he is good, and he loves you.

698
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,660
 Let me say it like this.

699
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,180
 God is powerful, plus he is good,

700
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,740
 plus he loves you, equals your peace.

701
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,580
 You see that equation?

702
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,700
 It's a really powerful equation.

703
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,180
 God is good, plus God is powerful,

704
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,020
 plus he loves you, so you have peace.

705
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
 You're here for just a little while,

706
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,260
 you're gonna be with him forever and ever and ever

707
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,940
 and ever and ever.

708
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,540
 I mean, this is just a bad day.

709
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,280
 At best, I mean, at worst, right?

710
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,700
 At worst, this is just a really, really bad day,

711
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,080
 at worst, compared to eternity.

712
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,540
 And then we're with him forever.

713
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,080
 But I'm not trying to make light of loss, man.

714
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,340
 I mean, there's loss, there's hurts.

715
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,760
 There's people who hurt you.

716
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,960
 There's people who've hurt you.

717
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,640
 Some of you here tonight, like there's folks

718
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,680
 who have really, really hurt you, who have betrayed you.

719
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,500
 People who were supposed to love you have hurt you.

720
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,280
 And God says, "Avenge is mine."

721
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,080
 He says this, he says, "You don't have to seek revenge."

722
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,180
 Romans 12, verse 19, "Do not take revenge, my dear friends,

723
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,300
 "my dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath,

724
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,940
 "for it is written, 'It is mine to avenge,

725
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,240
 "'I will repay,' says the Lord."

726
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,240
 God promises to deal with evil.

727
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,000
 God promises to deal with evil.

728
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,040
 But let me just ask a real honest question.

729
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,120
 If God is powerful and God is good,

730
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,480
 why doesn't he deal with evil now?

731
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,220
 Why doesn't he deal with it right now?

732
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,040
 Why doesn't he just do away with it?

733
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,380
 Let me ask you a question.

734
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,440
 Where would he start?

735
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,460
 Where would he start?

736
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,440
 Would he start with the sex trafficker?

737
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,960
 Or the one who looks at porn?

738
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,420
 Or maybe just the one who lusts in his heart?

739
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,800
 Right?

740
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,880
 Would he start with the sweatshop owner?

741
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,360
 Or the one who buys their clothes?

742
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,400
 Would he start with the prostitute?

743
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,960
 Or the one who judges her and her heart?

744
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,280
 Would he start with the evil politician?

745
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,220
 Or the person who perpetuates the ideas about them?

746
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,840
 Would he start with the homosexual?

747
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,800
 Or the person who is practicing heterosexual

748
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,600
 premarital sex, where would he start?

749
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,980
 'Cause usually, if we're honest,

750
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,900
 we're just like, hey, right past me.

751
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,740
 Right?

752
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,340
 I mean, start out there, God.

753
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,780
 Don't deal with this evil.

754
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,220
 What is he waiting on?

755
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,720
 He tells us 'cause he loves us.

756
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,860
 I mean, why hasn't he dealt with evil

757
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,460
 as he promised he would?

758
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,860
 2 Peter 3, verse nine.

759
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,640
 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise.

760
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,260
 As some understand slowness,

761
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,460
 instead he is patient with you,

762
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
 not wanting anyone to perish,

763
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,140
 but everyone to come to repentance.

764
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,900
 Do you see what's going on?

765
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,140
 He hadn't dealt with evil

766
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,180
 because he's dealing with evil through you

767
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,540
 so that you would advance the gospel.

768
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,660
 He hasn't dealt with evil right now

769
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,260
 so that one more person would be with him

770
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,780
 forever and ever and ever.

771
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,740
 He hasn't dealt with the pain that you're experiencing

772
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,660
 so one more person doesn't have to experience

773
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,620
 eternal pain forever and ever and ever

774
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,100
 because he loves us.

775
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,800
 You can't forget that he loves us.

776
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,980
 He's not slow in keeping his promises

777
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,020
 as some understand slowness.

778
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,580
 He's patient with you,

779
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,580
 not wanting anyone to perish,

780
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,140
 but everyone to come to repentance.

781
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,260
 That is a great and amazing God.

782
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,020
 And so it's his mercy that prevents him

783
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,360
 from dealing with evil,

784
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,100
 but he will deal with evil.

785
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,300
 In summary, our place is under his ultimate authority

786
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,060
 and the authority that he has placed over us.

787
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,680
 And we deal with corrupt authority

788
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,500
 by trusting him and following his word

789
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,820
 and being guided by his spirit.

790
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,780
 And there is no authority on earth

791
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,220
 that is not under God

792
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,020
 and so we can trust him.

793
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,980
 We can move to his word,

794
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,820
 live in his community,

795
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
 follow his spirit.

796
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
 We've sinned, man.

797
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
 That's the reality.

798
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,620
 And God demonstrates his mercy

799
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,620
 in our sin, in our evil

800
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,060
 by waiting,

801
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,780
 by allowing us to still be here.

802
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,980
 And he allows pain to take place today

803
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,180
 so that one more person can avoid it forever.

804
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,780
 But here's the deal,

805
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,020
 and this is where we'll end.

806
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,220
 He's gonna deal with it.

807
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,040
 All right, that's what I want you to know.

808
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,440
 God's gonna deal with it.

809
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,300
 All the evil and the wickedness,

810
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,400
 all the sadness,

811
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,840
 he's gonna deal with it, man.

812
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,800
 He's going to deal with it.

813
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,620
 Revelation 21, John wrote this,

814
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,960
 the apostle, he wrote it by visions.

815
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,940
 It's about the future.

816
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,520
 It's the last book in your Bible

817
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,920
 written about the first century.

818
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,280
 He says this in verse three.

819
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,120
 "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,

820
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,520
 "Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,

821
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,220
 "and he will dwell with them.

822
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,840
 "They will be his people,

823
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,000
 "and God himself will be with them and be their God."

824
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
 And maybe you read that and you're like,

825
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,840
 wait, God's gonna be with us?

826
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,920
 Well, hold on.

827
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,480
 Isn't God already with us?

828
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,600
 But God's already with us.

829
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,240
 Like, no, I'm the temple and God's in me,

830
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
 and God's here, and I'm, no.

831
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,640
 He's gonna be with you in a way

832
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,200
 that you can't even comprehend right now.

833
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,920
 Fully in his presence.

834
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
 How is he gonna be with you?

835
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,800
 Let me tell you how.

836
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
 He's gonna be with you

837
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,520
 like a loving father and his children.

838
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,200
 Like I sit with my girls by their bed

839
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
 and read them bedtime stories

840
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,080
 and love them and hug them and snuggle with them.

841
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,040
 He's gonna be with you like that.

842
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,880
 It's gonna be awesome.

843
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,380
 And so the other day, Presley comes home,

844
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,000
 and there's this pumpkin picture,

845
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,720
 and there's a face drawn on the pumpkin,

846
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,920
 and it's sad, and it says,

847
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,580
 "My pumpkin feels sad when," something.

848
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,380
 And then it says, "And I felt sad

849
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,240
 "when people left me out at recess."

850
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,900
 Okay, I saw it in the folder, her homework folder.

851
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,080
 And like, the response that I had,

852
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,320
 that's my girl, you know,

853
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,560
 and I'm like, hold on, wait a minute.

854
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
 Presley, come here.

855
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,360
 Hey, cute picture.

856
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,160
 Hey, who left you out at recess?

857
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,800
 (congregation laughing)

858
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,960
 No, no, no, no, let's talk.

859
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,600
 She's like, "Daddy, I don't wanna talk about it."

860
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,760
 Baby girl, I understand, but what was their name?

861
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,700
 (congregation laughing)

862
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
 But we gotta talk about this.

863
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,060
 Somebody left you out at recess.

864
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,620
 It made you feel sad?

865
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,700
 Daddy, real sad.

866
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,700
 (groans)

867
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,940
 (congregation laughing)

868
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,780
 It was like, weird, it was like anger meets brokenhearted.

869
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,420
 I'm like, oh, sad, really?

870
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,060
 They just said, "No, you can't play?"

871
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,020
 Like, yeah, they left me all by myself.

872
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,820
 You know what I, do you know what I feel?

873
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,820
 Like, I don't know if you guys know.

874
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,980
 Do you know what I feel in that moment?

875
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,620
 Like, all I wanna do, like, I'm her dad, man.

876
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,900
 All I wanna do is make that okay.

877
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,160
 Like, whatever I gotta do, like, I will call their parents,

878
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,020
 or I will dropkick them, or whatever I need to do

879
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,880
 to make this okay, all right?

880
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,220
 Like, I just wanna make it all right, okay?

881
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,180
 That's all I feel.

882
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,540
 Like, can I show you the first thing

883
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
 that God's gonna do when he lives here?

884
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,980
 The first thing he's gonna do,

885
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,660
 can I just show you from the Scripture?

886
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,300
 It says this, "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes."

887
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,060
 This is his first act, he shows up.

888
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,620
 Tears gone.

889
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,180
 "Like a loving father with you.

890
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,360
 "There will be no more death, or mourning,

891
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,320
 "or crying, or pain, or the old order of things

892
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,900
 "has passed away."

893
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,100
 The first thing that he will do is reach out

894
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,300
 and deal with their deepest hurts and disappointments.

895
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,180
 This is God who has all authority, all authority,

896
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,620
 and he can deal with everything, death and mourning,

897
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,660
 and sadness and sickness, in a moment,

898
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,580
 he wipes it away, that's his power.

899
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,540
 That's our God, and he deals with it,

900
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,540
 and he's gonna deal with it, all right?

901
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,260
 There's no more funerals, and no more sickness,

902
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,140
 and no more breakups, and no more sadness,

903
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,260
 and no more stillborns.

904
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,180
 That's our God.

905
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:43,500
 He's gonna deal with it, man.

906
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,560
 He shows up and he's like, "Man, that's my children.

907
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,400
 "Come here.

908
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,840
 "Come here, children.

909
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,640
 "Let me, you wanna see my authority?

910
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,580
 "You wanna see my authority?"

911
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,500
 The first thing that I will do,

912
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,220
 in the fullness of your presence, using my authority,

913
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,540
 is to make everything okay.

914
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,320
 I just wanna make it okay.

915
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,620
 Can I just make it okay?

916
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,180
 Come here, come, let me make it okay.

917
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,220
 And it's okay, 'cause it's God, and he's good,

918
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:19,020
 and all authority is his, and you can have peace.

919
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,340
 It's the peace that I saw in my friends,

920
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,900
 in a really messed up situation.

921
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,540
 They have a peace that didn't make sense,

922
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,780
 that the scripture says it transcends all understanding,

923
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,740
 they had that peace.

924
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,680
 Let me pray for that peace for us.

925
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,400
 Lord, we love you.

926
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,100
 We thank you for your word.

927
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,680
 We thank you for your promises,

928
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,060
 the ones that you fulfilled,

929
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,860
 and the ones that you will fulfill.

930
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,500
 We thank you for what you've done,

931
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,340
 and what you will do.

932
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,180
 We thank you for your son, Jesus Christ,

933
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,420
 who died for all of our sins.

934
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,540
 And you raised him from the dead,

935
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,780
 showing your power and authority over even death.

936
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,900
 Death is an ending, right?

937
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,300
 It seems like an ending if it's just the world.

938
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,780
 But for those who have trusted in your authority,

939
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,500
 it's the beginning of the best of the best.

940
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,340
 Please draw our hearts around that as we worship you.

941
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,180
 Amen.

942
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,260
 Amen, I know that some of you can't wait

943
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,900
 to sing heaven's song,

944
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,980
 'cause you don't know my God,

945
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,020
 and you don't know my Savior.

946
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,500
 And we desperately want you to.

947
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,420
 Man, we're not here to judge you or condemn you.

948
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,500
 The message of Christianity is that

949
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,280
 he set you free from your sins.

950
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,240
 In fact, the only people who can come to Jesus are sinners.

951
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,160
 And so if you're sitting there,

952
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,000
 you're like, man, I'm a sinner.

953
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,800
 Well, you're in the right place.

954
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,440
 We'd love to tell you about him

955
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,020
 so that you too can be like us,

956
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,540
 singing with authenticity.

957
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,020
 We cannot wait to sing heaven's song.

958
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,500
 Can't wait to sing that song.

959
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,040
 Can't wait to be with him.

960
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,420
 This is just a waiting room.

961
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,280
 This is just a foyer as we're about to go

962
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,820
 into the grand place.

963
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,340
 We're here for a short while.

964
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,380
 And we get to be with God forever and ever.
