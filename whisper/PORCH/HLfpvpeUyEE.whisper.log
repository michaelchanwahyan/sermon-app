[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   [Music]
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   All right, we welcome friends in the room.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Friends, get excited.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Friends in Fort Worth, Houston, El Paso, and any of the other 15, Tulsa, Woodlands,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   any of the other 15 or 16 Portslide locations.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Hey, we are continuing this series, "Before There Were Kings."
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I'm going to start with telling a little bit about my family life,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   specifically my son. That will give us some direction for where we're going.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I have a 3-year-old son named Crew.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   He's one of two children we have. This is him. There he is.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Oh, yeah, just rocking those Velcro shoes, man. Got to.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Here's what I love about my son, and I'm grieving because I know the day is going to come when this is going to change.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   He's at that age where there is not an insecure bone in this kid's body.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   He's as confident as he could possibly be, I mean, in so many different ways,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   whether it's the fact that, like, dude, I don't have to wear pants at any time.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   No pants, no problem. Let's do this thing.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   He wants to be--his probably preferred dress code would be just walking around in underwear.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And he's going to be ecstatic to show you the different designs that he has on his undergarments.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   He is not afraid to go out. If he's got food all over his face, that's just a normal thing for him.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   There's not an insecure part of his life.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   He's so confident that he wants to make sure that any new trait that he has picked up,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   he will just very quickly move to make sure strangers know what he can do.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   What do I mean by that? I mean, like, he recently learned how to jump, which is a big accomplishment when you're 3.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And by jump, I mean he literally leaves the ground like the size of a nickel.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   But he could be--he will be so stoked.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So he'll go up to, like, complete strangers and be like, "Hey, you want to see me jump?"
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And he'll--what's up now?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   And he'll get so excited, he'll, like, run around in circles.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And it's like, I don't know who's--who's this kid's parents.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   He gets this from his mother. She's always doing that kind of thing.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   "You want to see me jump?"
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And he just has so much confidence inside of his life.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He is just willing to go to one stranger to the next, and he'll just say,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   "Hey, have you heard me sing the alphabet song?"
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And he'll just go from one person to the next, and he'll just very quickly move through.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He wants to make sure you know all the different skills and confidence that he has.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And the reason I say as a dad, one thing that I've been thinking of is I get sad about the reality
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   that there's going to come a day where that security and confidence no longer is what it is currently
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   or said more clearly.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   There's going to come a day where he experiences and begins to experience insecurity.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And he will not have just the confidence that I can go out, and I don't care what I look like
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and what other people think and look at me and look how great this is.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But insecurity is coming for him.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And I know that because it came for me.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And it's come for everyone that I've ever met.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And at some point in their life, it's like we awaken to insecurity.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   We become very self-conscious, very concerned about what other people think about us,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   very insecure about just different parts of our lives.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And when you think about the fact that every person in this room could quickly think of--
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   if I said, "Hey, if you could change one thing about your external appearance,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   let's just start as shallow as that," one thing, all of us would quickly go, "I know what I'd change.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I've got a list, but if I can only pick one, I know what I'd change."
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And as long as--really, I can remember insecurity has been a part of my life.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So I don't know what insecurity looks like for you.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I just want to talk about battling insecurity.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Initially, I called the message that we're about to talk through, the cure for insecurity,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and then I was like, "I don't think that's honest.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I don't know that there is a one-size-fits-all cure,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   but there is a way that God lays out for us to battle insecurity."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   What do I mean by insecurity? Get us all on the same page.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Here's what Webster's defines it and how I'm going to incorporate is,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   "Hey, insecurity is uncertainty or anxiety about oneself, a lack of confidence."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I don't know what insecurities have been a part of your story
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   or maybe a part of your past or a part of your present,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   but think about the ways insecurity has shaped us.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Think about, like, maybe in middle school, you were late to the game to get braces
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   or you were early to the game to get braces or you had the bowl cut
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   or you had just, you know, parents who dressed you in a way that you're like,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   "What were you thinking, Mom?"
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Maybe you were a late bloomer and you were insecure about the fact
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   that everyone had already gone through puberty and you were like,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   "I'm in the 10th grade and I don't have armpit hair."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Or maybe you were an early bloomer, which is not any better, right?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   When you're like 6'4" and everyone else is still like 5'2"?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Unless you're a guy, I guess, and then you're like, "Fee-fi-fo-fo."
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But just think about how insecurity is something that, man, it plagues
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and can plague all of us.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Today, insecurity about what you look like,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   about the clothes that you have, the job that you have, the car that you drive,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   how it can own your perspective in a moment and rob you of the ability
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   to be present with people because you're too concerned about what they think.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   In my own life, I think about how insecurity can have power over
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and has had power over just my willingness to try things
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   because I'm afraid I would fail.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I'm insecure.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I mean, I remember distinctly even in college, we'd go out--
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and I didn't grow up skiing on the water--
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   we'd go out and we'd go on a boat and we'd go ski.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And I remember at some point I tried skiing, couldn't do it,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and that marked me in a way where every time we got on a boat,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I'm like, "I'm good. I'll pass."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It was just an insecurity.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Insecurity I can resonate with in my own life of just ways
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   that I can be insecure over external appearance.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   You always hear a phrase, "Tall, dark, and handsome,"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   and for my whole life, I've never heard "tall, extra Caucasian,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   and strawberry-blind."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You're not supposed to laugh at that. That's offensive.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   No, but--so I don't know what that looks like for you,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   but I know that insecurity is something that has come
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   and comes for all of us.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And yet it will rob you if you and I allow it to.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It will rob us from experiencing and really becoming
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   everything God wants you to become.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It may rob you of the future spouse you're supposed to have
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   because you're too insecure to not be in a dating relationship.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So your standards are not like, "Hey, are they biblical?"
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   and they kind of meet God's criteria. You're like, "Are they breathing?"
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   That's what I'm more concerned about. And so you go from one to the next and next,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   and you forfeit seeing what God has for you because you're too insecure to be alone.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It may cause you to change jobs, to make life decisions,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   to orient your life because you're like, "Man, I'm defined by this car,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   so I have to stay in debt,"
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   or, "I'm concerned about what other people think about me."
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Just think about the power. And yet there is a freedom that God wants to have
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   in our life, or wants us to have, as it relates to insecurity.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And in that freedom, we are better able to experience
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   becoming the person God wants you to become,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   experiencing a life full of purpose,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   and a life, candidly, where you are comfortable in your own skin.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   How tragic is it that that seems so far-fetched for so many people?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And so what I want to cover from the book of Judges,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   which is what we've been in as we explore this series, "Before There Were Kings,"
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   is the story of a guy, a guy named Gideon.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And in his story, there's some principles that I think are so profoundly helpful
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   as we battle insecurity. If you take notes, that's what tonight's message is.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's battling insecurity. It's battling insecurity.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   So we're going to be in the book of Judges, chapter 6,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and the series that we're in, "Before There Were Kings,"
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   it's basically looking at some of the characters in the book of Judges,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   which is named after these different men.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   A judge in that time was not like Judge Judy with a black gown and a gavel.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   A judge at that time was a deliverer that God would raise up to save the people.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And so really, the book of Judges is like the X-Men, if you will.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's like these different people that God--
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   you know, he kind of pulls out Samson, "You're super strong."
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   He pulls out Deborah, "You're going to be Ice Woman," or whatever.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   He pulls out these different people, and God shows up to them,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   not Professor Xavier.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I hope people are following me on that. I just asked.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   What's the name of the guy, the bald guy?
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And--well, he shows up, and he basically says,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   "Hey, you're going to come be on my team. You're going to be a part of the X-Men."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   That's who the different judges are.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And the judges would come and deliver the nation of Israel,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   which is what the Old Testament's all about.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Basically, the nation of Israel would do the same thing over and over and over
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   in the book of Judges.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And here's what they would do.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   God would set them free.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They would sin against God and worship false idols.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   God would say, "You want foreign idols? I'm going to let you have foreign rulers."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   They'd be conquered by foreign rulers.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They would cry out to God. That's called supplication.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   I think we have a slide even of that.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Basically, just where they cry out and be like, "God, we're sorry. Save us."
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And then God would send a deliverer.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He would send a judge to set them free.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Tonight, we're going to meet the judge named Gideon.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But this was the cycle that goes on and on and on and on.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And because of that cycle, the words before--
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   or in those days, there was no king in Israel.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's setting up the fact that the nation would cry out for a king
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   because they would just keep going through this cycle, this sin cycle,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   over and over and over again, crying out,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   "Hey, we need a king, someone to come in and rule our lives."
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   So that's the series that we're going to be in.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   We're going to pick it up in chapter 6.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And really, 6 through 8, chapters 6 through 8 in the book of Judges
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   cover the life of Gideon.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And I'm just going to high-level go over the story
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   so you can, again, like we did a couple weeks ago,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   kind of watch the movie with me.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And I'm just going to tell what happened.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   But let me start in verse 1 of chapter 6,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   at the story of Gideon.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "The Israelites," verse 1, "did evil in the Lord's sight.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So the Lord handed them over to the Midianites for seven years."
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So the Midianites are the conquering power,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   the villains, if you will, of the story that we're about to look at.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They come in, they conquer.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And verse 6, "Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   so the Israelites cried out to the Lord."
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So we're in that cycle. They sin. God gives them over.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   They're conquered. They're like, "God, we're sorry. Save us."
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And so here's--he sends his deliverer, Gideon.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   "Then the angel of the Lord,"
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   which scholars have long pointed out is likely Jesus.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   The angel of the Lord, the only term of that title
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   doesn't appear in all the New Testament.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   It's consistently in places like this.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   We're about to see that it would be--
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   the angel of the Lord would appear,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and people believe that it is the pre-Christmas Jesus,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   that it is God himself showing up
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   before he came to this earth in his appearance,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   which is why it doesn't show up inside all the New Testament.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So he shows up, not Professor Xavier,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Jesus himself to call Gideon, and he does this.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   "Gideon, the son of Joash, was threshing wheat
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   at the bottom of a winepress to hide grain from the Midianites."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Who hasn't been there? Am I right?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   What does that even mean? What is he doing?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   He's threshing wheat, and I don't have all the time to get into it,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   but basically the author's trying to point out,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   like, this dude was scared, he's threshing wheat,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   he basically wants to make a sandwich,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   but he's not doing it out in the open,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   he's doing it in the bottom of a winepress, which is like a pit.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   He's afraid is the point that he's trying to make.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   This guy that's going to be the hero at this point
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   is not courageous, but he's a coward.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And the angel of the Lord says to him this.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   "The angel of the Lord appeared and said,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   'Mighty hero, the Lord is with you,'"
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   or "valiant hero," your translation may have.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   What is that, valiant?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   He's hiding, he's afraid, he's terrified,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   he's at the bottom, he's basically in a pit
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   trying to make a sandwich.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   What do you mean the angel of the Lord shows up and says,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   "Hey, I see you as heroic, I don't see you as you.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   See you.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I see all that you can be and will be."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   He saw things in Gideon he didn't even see in himself,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   and he says, "Hey, you're going to be the one,"
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   in the next verse, "to deliver my people."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And Gideon responds, and he says, verse 15,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   "But Lord, how can I rescue Israel?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and I'm the least in my entire family."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   So hey, my squad is the weakest of all squads,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and I'm the weakest in my squad.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   How can you use me to be the person
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   that you would set free, God?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   There's a lot of other people
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   that would be better than me,
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   even in my own family, he says.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   "But the Lord said to him, 'I will be with you,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and I will destroy the Midianites
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   as if you were fighting them against one man.'"
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   So Gideon's sitting there, and he's like,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   "Man, you're going to have me fight this oppressive enemy?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Okay, if that's true, I need to have a sign."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So he says this, "Gideon replied,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   'If you're going to truly help me,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   show me a sign to prove that it's really
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   the Lord speaking to me.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Don't go away until I come back
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   and bring my offering to you.'
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And he answered, 'I'll stay here until you return.'"
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So Gideon runs away, kind of gets an offering.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   He's going to make a sacrifice to the Lord,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and he begins to build the altar.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's all in front of the angel of the Lord,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and he's putting it together.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   He's looking for his lighter to light this thing on fire.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Angel of the Lord, we're told, does this.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   "Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the bread
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   with the tip of his staff, and fire,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   flamed up from the rock,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   consumed all that he had brought,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and the angel of the Lord disappears."
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So he's sitting there looking for a lighter,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   and angel of the Lord just shoots fire onto this thing.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Everything's gone.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Gideon immediately kind of overreacts,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and he's like, "Oh my goodness, it really is the Lord.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   I've seen the Lord. I'm going to die."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And the angel of the Lord basically goes,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   "Hey, dude, it's chill.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I would have killed you already if I was going to kill you.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Just keep calm."
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And that's my own paraphrase,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   but that's essentially what happens.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And Gideon goes, "Man, I guess the Lord is with me."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And he goes off to assemble an army
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   to go fight the Midianites.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And then a little bit of time goes by,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and he begins to wonder, like,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   "Man, was I really sure that God was with me?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Am I really confident that what I think he wants me to do
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   is what he wants me to do?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I need to get another sign."
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That's the problem with signs.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Like, they don't last.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   So he's like, "I need another sign."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So he goes to God and says, "Hey," verse 36,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   "If you're truly going to rescue Israel as you promised,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   prove it to me in this way."
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And he says, "Hey, I'm going to lay out a fleece.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And on the fleece, it'll be on the ground,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   and when I wake up in the morning, God,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   if the fleece is wet but everything around it is dry,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   then I will know that you're with me,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and I will know."
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And so it's kind of a weird sign,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   but he goes to bed, wakes up that morning,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   the fleece is soaking wet, all the ground around it is dry.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And then he begins to go, "Wait a second.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   That could have just been like a weird rainstorm,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   or I don't know what happened here.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Somebody could have just poured water on it,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   playing like a joke on me.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   God, if it's really you, I'm going to set a fleece out,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and I need it to be completely dry,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   have all the ground around it be soaking wet."
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Goes to bed, wakes up the next morning,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   the ground is soaking wet, the fleece is dry,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   and he's like, "Man, I guess this is what God
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   is calling me to do."
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   He begins to assemble his army.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   He gets 32,000 people.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   That's a lot of people.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Here's the problem.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   The army he was facing had 120,000 people.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I'm not, and have never been great at math,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   but even I can see those are not great odds.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Those are four to one.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And one day God shows up, and he's like sitting there,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and he's like, "What are we going to do with 32,000?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Hopefully these guys are good fighters."
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Looking at them, they're all starving, farmers.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So he's like, "Well, that's not, we can't bank on that.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   We need another plan."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And he's sitting there, and he's beginning to think,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   "What are we going to do?"
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And God shows up, and God says this.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   "Gideon, you have too many warriors.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   If I let all of you fight the Midianites,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   the Israelites will boast to me that they saved themselves
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   by their own strength."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   So he shows up, and you've got to be thinking,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I mean, how did that look?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Sitting there, God shows up, and he's like,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   "Hey, Gideon, you getting ready for war?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I've got to talk to you.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   We've got a problem with the numbers."
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Gideon's like, "Yep, I'm glad you brought it up.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I wasn't going to say anything, but I feel like the same thing.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   It's four to one over here."
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And he's like, "I want you to shrink the army."
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   And he's like, "Did I hear you?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   You want me to shrink the army?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   What do you mean shrink the army?"
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   He's like, "Anyone who's afraid, tell them that they can go home."
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So Gideon, he gets the group together.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   He's like, "What are you thinking at that point?"
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   You're like, "Afraid?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Look, it's four to one."
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   "Hey, guys, God told me to give an announcement.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I know nobody here is going to respond to,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   but if you're afraid"--I know none of us are, right?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   "If you're afraid, you can leave.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Most of the army leaves.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   It's down to 10,000."
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And God shows up again, and he says, "Gideon,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   there's still too many," verse 4,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "Bring them down to the spring, and I will test them
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   to determine who will go with you and who will not."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   So God introduces the very first drinking game ever.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   There's no alcohol involved, and he says, "Hey,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I want them to go down to the spring,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   and based on a certain way that they drink,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   will be the factor that determines whether or not
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   they're going to be in this new squad and this new crew."
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   If I'm Gideon at this point, I'm like,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "I'm not sure I want to be a part of this plan."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Shrink it again.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   He does the drinking game.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   They get down to 300 men, and God says, "Perfect."
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's the original 300, for any of my guy friends in the room.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Verse 7, "With these 300 men," the Lord said,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   "I will rescue you and give you victory
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   over the Midianites.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Send everyone else or all the others home."
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   So Gideon goes from 4 to 1 odds to 12 to 1 odds
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   to 400 to 1 odds.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I mean, at this point, he has soiled himself multiple times.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Think about it.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   300 people compared.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   They're battling against the whatever biggest football
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   stadium, college football stadium you've ever seen.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   120,000, bigger than that.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Verse 300.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   He's sitting there going, "What are we going to do, God?"
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   He basically gets the instructions.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   He goes, and at night, and here's the plan.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   He divided the men into 300 men into three groups,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   and he gave each man not a sword but a ram's horn,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   which is essentially like old-school trumpet,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   and a clay jar with a torch in it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And he said, "Hey, on my command," he goes up to the
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   enemy's camp, and it says that he looks into the camp,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   and as far as the eye can see, he sees camels.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   The quote from the text is that the number of camels
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   outnumbered the number of sand on the seashore.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   It's like as far as the eye can see, he sees people.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   And yet he gets his 300 together, and he says,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   "On my count, everyone blow the ram's horn, take your torch
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   "with the jar around it, and throw it and smash it
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   "on the ground."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And the men listen, and they do what they were told,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   and here's what happened.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   "When the 300 Israelites blew their ram's horn,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "the Lord caused the warriors in a camp to fight against
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   "each other with their swords.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   "Those who were not killed fled to places as far away as
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   "Beth Shiddah and near Zerah and the border of," I'm not
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   even gonna try, "near Tabith."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Then he basically shows up, they take the ram, they blow
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   the horn, they take their torch, they throw it on the ground.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   All of a sudden, there's fire breaking out everywhere.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   The Midianites begin to panic.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   There's loud noise taking place everywhere, and it says
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   it's so dark outside, the Midianite camps and battalions
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   begin to fight one another, and they think that they're
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   being overtaken, and the ones that aren't killed by one
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   another end up just running off and fleeing.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And Gideon, through the Lord, through his plan,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   delivered and rescued the people of Israel.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Gideon's weakness was his strength.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They didn't lose a single person.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   That had they brought the 32,000, even if they had won,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   there was likely a good chance that there's gonna be some
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   serious casualties, even if those guys can each take on
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   four people, a person.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   But with 300 men, God delivers and rescues the Midianites.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Now, when I look at this story, there's so many different
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   things I don't wanna pull out, but there's just three as it
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   relates to insecurity that I think are profoundly helpful
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   principles, repeated all throughout the Bible, but three
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   that are definitely inside of these texts.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And so I just wanna give three takeaways as it relates to
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   fighting and battling insecurity, or winning the battle
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   of insecurity, and the first one is this, that you fight
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   insecurity with your God-given identity.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   There's a lot of Christian-y words in there, so I want you
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   to hang with me, 'cause I think this is so huge.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   You and I fight insecurity with your God-given identity.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The Lord shows up to Gideon, and he says, "Hey, let me tell
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   "you who you are."
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   In chapter 6, verse 12, "Let me tell you who you are.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   "You are a mighty and valiant warrior.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   "I don't see you like you see you.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   "I don't see you like your family sees you.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   "This is who you are."
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And he sees and says something about Gideon.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Gideon never would have even seen or said about himself,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   "You are a mighty, valiant warrior, and I am with you."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And he speaks that over Gideon.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   You know what is most true about you?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Whatever God says about you.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   What is most true about you are the things that God says
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   about you.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Your God-given identity is your truest identity that there is.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Now, here's where that matters, and so stay with me in case
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   you're like, "I don't know that I'm totally following."
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   The things that God says, "This is who you are," are the most
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   true labels you will ever wear in your life.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   The labels that you wear of, "Hey, I'm too fat.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   "I'm too ugly.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   "I'm too small.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   "I'm not smart enough.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   "I'm not good enough.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   "I don't have the right job.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   "I'm not lovable.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   "I'm dysfunctional in a dating relationship."
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I'm--whatever the labels that you are, that you wear, or you have
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   worn in the past, they are lies when you compare them to the
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   truths that God says about you.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   How do I know that?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Because who can really give a label to someone and it actually
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   be a true label?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Well, as I thought about it, there's a few groups.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   There's someone--if you're the maker, the manufacturer of
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   something, like if Nike makes a shoe, they put a label on there.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   If Adidas is like, "Hey, I'd like to put this on."
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   They can't put a label on there.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Nike can't decide.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   They're the maker.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   They can decide what goes on there and what doesn't.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   If you're the maker, you can put a label on something.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   If you are the owner, you can put a label on something like,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   "Hey, I can name my car," and I can be like, "You know what?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   "My car's named Stallion."
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   If you came up and you're like, "We're going to name your car
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   "Pegasus," I'd be like, "That's weird.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   "You're not the owner.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   "You can't put a label on it."
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Or if you're the purchaser, if you purchase something, you can
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   put a label on it, you can name it.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   I have a friend who recently--not long ago, they bought a dog that
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   was 12 years old, this bulldog.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And the bulldog had been named Sophie its entire life, and they
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   were like, "Yeah, it's now our dog, so we're going to call you
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   "Fran," not even in like in the same universe where it's like,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   "Frofee, she'll still come to that.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   "She's never once come to Fran.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   "She still thinks her name is Sophie, but they're the owners,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   "and they can say, 'This is your name.'"
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   You're the maker, you're the owner, you're the purchaser.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   God is all three of those things.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   He made you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   He tells us that your body is not your own.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   You were bought with a price.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   He purchased you, and everything that you have is on loan,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   including you.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   What God says about you is the thing that is most true about you.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Whatever labels that you're going to wear, whatever labels you're
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   wearing right now, whatever labels you have worn, are at best
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   temporary, because you may be thinking, "Well, what about my
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   "job title?"
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Like that, you know, that's kind of true.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   That is at best temporary.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   You will likely not be X whatever forever, or you won't be forever
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   for all of eternity.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   What God says about you is the things that are most true about you.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   What are some of the things that God says, some labels that are
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   not lies?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   You were loved.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   You were created on purpose.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   If you have trusted in Jesus, you are pure, righteous, holy.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Everything in your past, everything in your present does not define
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   you the way that Christ does.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   You have been forgiven.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   You're a child of God.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Those are the labels that are the things that are most true about you,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and you will fight insecurity.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Like, man, hey, I can fight the fact that, man, I don't like the way
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that I look.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I don't like how much that I make.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   I don't like all the things that people think about me.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   By saying, man, the one who matters most, this is what he thinks
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   about me.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   The labels that are the truest, this is what they are about me.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And the God who's there would look at your life, and I wonder what he
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   would say.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Some of you just need to know there's a God who knows your name.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   He knows your name.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   He has plans for you.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   He has purposes for you.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Ephesians 2, verses 10 said that before the creation of the world,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   he had good works planned for your life that he wanted you to experience
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   and be a part of.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   In other words, God, before the world was created, had a to-do list with
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   your name, big things that he wanted to accomplish through you.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But if you and I will allow our insecurity to drive us away from
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   allowing the freedom that comes from focus, this is who your truest
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   identity is now and always and always will be.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Or you can get caught up, like I can, in some of the lies, the labels
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   that can get put on you, labels like, "Man, you are what you make.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   You are what other people think about you.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   You are who you look or how you look.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   You are the job that you have, the relationship status that you have."
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And they're lies.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   They're labels that won't last because what is most true about you is what
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   God says about you.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   It was for Gideon, and it is for you.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Second takeaway that we see in just his story is this, that confidence
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   from anything temporary is temporary.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's very simple on its face, but think about the things that Gideon was
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   looking for confidence in.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Like he was looking at least for two.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Two of the things that he looked for confidence, like, "Man, hey, this is
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   when I know I'm going to be confident.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   This would make me feel a little bit more secure about myself."
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   There were two arenas.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   One of them was signs.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But he looked to find confidence, "Man, if God's really going to work,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   then, you know, I've got to have a sign."
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And four different times were told in this story that he looked for a sign.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   That's the problem with signs.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   They don't last.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   A little bit of time goes by, and you're like, "Man, was that really God
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   talking to me?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I mean, this is a free public service announcement."
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   This is like the problem, or I would be at least cautious for it because
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   working with young adults, there's a lot of times where people come down,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   and you're like, "Man, you know what?
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I wasn't sure if I would date her or I should date her."
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And then I was in the car, I was driving, I was like, "God, if you want me
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   to date her, make the next four lights green."
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And then I knew.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   They were all four green.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I slowed down a little bit, but they were all four green.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And it's like, "Dude, you're thinking like a Looney Tune.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   That's crazy."
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Anything that does not align with God's Word, you should be cautious about
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   whether or not, "Hey, and then God showed me because I was like,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   if the lights are yellow or if, you know, I go outside and there's bird poop
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   on my car, I know it's you."
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   That's a random example.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Anytime that someone says, "Hey, I just feel like, you know, God told me,"
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and the next word's out of their mouth or anything that doesn't come from the
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Bible, you should be cautious.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "Hey, God told me."
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   How did he tell you?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And maybe he did.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I'm not saying he didn't.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I'm just saying, "Hey, you should proceed with caution because there's a lot
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   of things that God has told you.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And if any of the things that God has told you don't align with God's Word
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   or counsel from kind of God's people around you, you should be concerned
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   and be cautious."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   He looked for confidence in signs, and they didn't last.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He just needed one after the next and the next.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Because anything, any confidence that you come from something temporary is
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   always going to be temporary.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   The other arena that he looked for confidence was in comparison.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   "Dude, this is convicting," or was for me.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Here's why it was convicting.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Like he looked around and he was like, "Hey, here's how I would feel more
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   confident, God.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   If I was more impressive, if I was from a better family, if I didn't have kind
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   of this baggage in my past, if I was from a stronger tribe."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Remember that in the verse where he said, "Hey, how can you use me?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   I'm from the weakest clan and the weakest family, and you're going to use me?"
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   That built into his idea is that, "Man, if I was from something impressive,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   if I was from a great family, a great family, if I was more physically
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   impressive, then, God, you could use me.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Then I would be confident."
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And confidence from comparison will never last.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Think about the ways that our confidence is impacted, has been impacted,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   is being impacted by comparison.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Think about how much self-confidence we don't have, or maybe we do have
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   because of comparison.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   I mean, we're constantly like, "We've made it easier than ever to compare our
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   lives to one another."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Think about that.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And I wonder how that's robbing us of being comfortable with who we are,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   focused on what God has around us, focused on doing God's will around us,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   focused on loving people versus just seeking to make them love me.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   What I mean by that is we made it easier than ever.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   We have like apps.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   One of the primary things that certain apps and social media even do is they kind
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   of give us our daily dose of discontentment, to quote a girl on our team.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   They give us that chance of like comparison.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   I can go on and compare to everyone else's life all over the place,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   every friend that I have.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I compare to, "Hey, what they're doing."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   I mean, think about like there used to be a day where when I went on,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   when I had lunch today, I would just like look at my lunch and maybe people's
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   lunches around me.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Now I go online and everyone is posting about what they're eating.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Can we talk about this for a second?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   This is weird.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   When was it ever normal in all of human history to be like,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   "I need to tell everyone I'm having a burrito, okay?
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Everyone everywhere needs to know where I am."
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   But it's just a part of who we are.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   We compare everything.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I know what's going on in everybody's life.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   I can look and be like, "Well, there's always somebody with a nicer car.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I can't believe they're on vacation again.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Do they even have a job?"
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   It's just easy to compare and be so like, "Oh, man, man, I'm pathetic.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   They always look amazing.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Where are they even buying this stuff?"
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Now there's app notifications or there's notification.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I'm getting notifications from people sending me their workout information.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   "Will you quit sending me your workout?"
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   On the Apple Watch, it's like, "Oh, yeah, they worked out today.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Great."
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Is that a reminder?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Ouch, okay?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Get it.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I don't have time.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   We got kids.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Leave me alone.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's just easier than ever is my point.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   In the only way that I really can think of, and there's probably several other ones, so
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   don't email me.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   This may be one of the few areas where we have it harder than older generations.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Every other way that your grandparents would walk to snow, there was no shoes, the Great
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Depression, all that stuff, but they didn't have to deal, which is worse, much worse.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Let's all acknowledge, much worse.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   But they were not confronted with so many of the things that you're bombarded with every
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   single day.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And if you are not careful, you will do what we're all tempted to do every time, which
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   is compare our life, and based on how I stack up to the clan or the people in my family,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   like Gideon, will determine how I stack up in life, who I am, how valuable I am, how
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   excited or how much joy I can have.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   My mood will go up and down based on how I stack up.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I mean, we were talking about it today.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I think of, if my house, the only reason I want another house is because I see and compare
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   to other people around.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   If my house was transplated to the East Congo, Africa, I'd be like, "Dude, I am living large
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   here."
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   But when you're surrounded and able to compare constantly, you're able to all of a sudden
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   be like, "Man, I got nothing.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I don't have enough.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I never have enough."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   And if you are not careful, you will put your confidence in things that are temporary, and
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   it will always be a temporary dose of confidence that will not last.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   You will draw from a well that will always leave you wanting, always leave you in need.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   If you find your confidence in how you look, you will constantly be insecure.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   No matter how pretty you are, some of the most beautiful people in our society are the
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   most insecure.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   If you know anyone in the modeling agency, they will confirm that.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   If you put your confidence in a dating relationship, you're going to move from one dysfunctional
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   relationship to the next and the next, because here's what's more important than you getting
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   healthy or dating someone who is healthy and holy.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   What's more important is you having a relationship, because it's where you draw your security,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   your confidence.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   You don't know what it's like to not have someone around.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   So you will never heal as a person.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   You'll never get out of that dysfunctional relationship and heal by pursuing what God
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   wants for you.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   You'll just go from one to the next to the next.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And you will always come up wanting, because anything, any confidence that comes from temporary
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   things will always be temporary.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   If you look for it in money, if you look for it in number of followers on Instagram, you
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   will never have enough.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And the God who's there saying, I don't want you to look.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   The goal of this message is not for you to have more self-confidence.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   In other words, it's not like, hey, guys, you need to just be you and you look great
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   today and look in that mirror and be like, I'm a million bucks.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   That's not the goal that will never last.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   The goal is not for you to have self-confidence.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   It's for you to find a source of confidence outside of yourself, for you to find a source
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   of confidence that comes from God and from God alone.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That he's the only well that will never run dry.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   That is the goal.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   In other words, it is not about how much confidence you have.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Is it about as is it is?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   As it is about.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   What has you confident?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   It's not about how much confidence you have.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   It's about what has you confident?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Is it how you look?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Is it something temporary?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Or is it the fact that there's a God who knows your name, who's moving the pieces, he's sovereign
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   over your life, he's in control of all things, he's working everything for your good, he
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   made you just as you are, he has a plan and a purpose for your life, you could trust him,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   you can trust his way.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Is that where you find your confidence?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Or is it in your car?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Is it how much you make?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   How much is in your bank account?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Anything temporary will always be temporary and will always leave you wanting.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   In my front yard, we have a natural spring underneath our house.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   It's really bizarre.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And it leads to one interesting thing.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   I may have the only yard on the block that like we're never gonna have a problem of the
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   grass being watered.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   If anything, the problem is like too much.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   There's constant water.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   There's a spring of water underneath our house.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   So it can constantly keep, it does constantly keep kind of our grass always watered, never thirsty.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   The God who's there wants you to experience a life where you are never thirsty.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   There's a constant spring.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   You don't have to keep going back and forth and ebb and flow and how did my day go today
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   and how much money did I make today or what did they think about me today or what relationship
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   do I have today, but it's constant, it's fixed, because it doesn't come from self.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   It comes from him.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Have you ever met someone that has that type of confidence?
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   It's like startling, isn't it?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Like they're like, they're comfortable in who they are.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   They're like content.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   They have this God confidence in it.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   It like makes them like content.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Like they have peace when things kind of go crazy.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   They know who God made them and they're it's like they're okay with it.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Because they found a source that is not leaving them wanting because they're not looking for
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   their confidence to come from something temporary.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   If you are looking for your confidence to come from that, you will always be on the
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   roller coaster ride of emotions and never experience the security that God wants you
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   to experience.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   It comes from knowing him, walking and trusting in him.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Finally, the third idea just related to confidence and security is this.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Confidence in God comes through obedience.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Confidence in God comes through obedience.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   You will grow your confidence, your trust in God.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   You'll grow your faith in God, said another way, by trusting and obeying.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Think about how Gideon's faith or his confidence in God grew in that moment.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   He's going up and he's like, dude, we had 30,000.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   God said take it down to 10.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   I'm like, are you serious?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You want me to take it down to 10,000?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Now we're down to 300 people.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   He looks and he sees camels as far as the eye can see.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And in a moment, he's got a decision.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   He walks to the line and says, I'm going to obey God.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   And in doing so, he does.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   And think about how his confidence, wow, God's word, his promises are true.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I can trust him.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Think about how that would have grown.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Think about how it would have not had he walked up to the line and been like, yeah,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I see camels.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   We're out on this.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Guys, let's all go home.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Let's try to get the other 30,000 back.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Think about what he would have forfeited and missed out on.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   He wouldn't have seen God deliver his people.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   He wouldn't have been a part of God's plan.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   He wouldn't have seen all the ways, the incredible, miraculous, if you will, ways that God worked.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Think about what he would have missed out on.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And here's what's so important for you, for young adults in the room.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   We're about to be done.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Most of us don't ever step up to the line like Gideon did in that moment and say, man,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   this is what God is asking me to do.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   It seems crazy.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   It seems countercultural.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   It honestly seems like pretty big.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   God, I'm not sure that I want to do that.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   It seems a little foreign, a little too much.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Most of us walk up to the line and instead of saying, even though it's all those things, God, I'm willing, I'm going to obey you.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Most of us walk up to the line and we go, I'm not doing that.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   I'm going home.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   We walk up to the line and we go, God, you said you want me to save sex for marriage.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   That's so old fashioned.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   That's so outdated.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   That's too much to ask.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   God, I'm not doing that.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   You're saying that I have to like work a job or if I'm working a job that doesn't really allow me to be plugged into a church, to be using kind of my gifts, to make Jesus more famous, to be in a community group and to be have other believers in my life to encourage me.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   You're saying that if I work a job and there's just too many hours that I'm working that prohibit or don't allow me to do those things that I should change jobs.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Yeah, I'm not doing that unless the other job has more money than I would do it.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   But I'm not crossing that line.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Most of us, we walk up to the line, we go, that's too big of a thing.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And we choose not to obey.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And we forfeit seeing all the ways that God is going to work.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Let me let me be really specific.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   When you walk up to the line and you say, God, this is how you're telling me I should date.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   That seems so crazy to me.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I can't do that.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   God, nobody does that like that.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   All the good Christian guys or Christian girls are taken.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I just it doesn't work that way.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   God, I'm going to do it my own.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   You do it your own.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   And you will forfeit seeing what God could have done, what God would have done.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And you will end up with that guy on Tinder that you met.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And you'll have that relationship kind of string along.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   And you'll break up a couple times, get back together and manichaeism, manic close.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   And that's the future that you have in store.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   And you will forfeit seeing what God could have done, what God wanted to do.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   If you're the person who says, like, look, I'm 32.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I'm running out of options here, God.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And so, yes, he's not exactly all in with Jesus.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   But he comes to church with me.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And that feels like a plus.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   So I'm going to date him even though your word says I shouldn't.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   That I shouldn't be unequally yoked.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   That people in my life who are Christians are saying, hey, I don't think that guy is good for you.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Even though all those things are true.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   I'm going to date him, God, because I don't have that many options.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   My biological clock is ticking.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   And I am not going to -- you're saying that, man, if I follow God, I may end up single.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Too big.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Outtie.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   It's what most of us do.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And you forfeit seeing how God would have worked, could have worked, wanted to work, all that he would have done in your life.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Just like Gideon, had he walked away from the line, he would have forfeited seeing everything God was about to do for him.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And the God who's there is saying, I love you.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I'm crazy about you.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   My way is better.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Will you trust me?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Are you going to keep trusting in yourself in your own ways?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And if you do, your confidence in me will not grow.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Because the only way it grows is through obedience to me.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And whenever you take that step and you trust me, you begin to go, wow, that actually worked.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   God's way really is better.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   There's no one out there -- I've never met and heard the story.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   I've been doing this for ten years.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I've never heard the person be like, look, hey, you know, this is my wife.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   We ended up together.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   This has been great.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   You know, the one regret I have is I didn't have enough casual sex in my 20s.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   That's the one thing I feel like I left on the field.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   I've never heard it.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   I've never heard the person who said I went all in with Jesus.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Now, I don't mean somebody who is just anybody.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   I mean somebody who stands before you and goes, man, my life is filled with purpose and joy.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   I'm following Jesus.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   I'm all in.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   That couple, you never hear them say that.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I've never heard the person who said, man, I went all in with Jesus and just everything, it was terrible.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Not that it wasn't hard.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   Not that there wasn't challenges that came in life.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   But they began to experience purpose and peace, contentment, even confidence, comfortable in their own skin.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And that's what the God who's there, he wants you to experience.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   He wants you to put your confidence in him, but your confidence in him will only grow through obedience.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   And every day you have the choice.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Am I going to choose to grow that confidence by being obedient or not and forfeit what God could have done, would have done?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   I think most of us, it's really easy, especially in Dallas, to say, man, God, I trust you with our words and not with our actions.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   I'm not actually going to follow it up.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I say I believe you, but I'm not actually going to act on those things that I say I believe.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   There's a guy in the 1860s, and I'll close here, and his name was Blondine.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   He was a famous tightroper in France, and then he came over to America, and this dude did mind-blowing feats.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   He particularly was well-known and famous for being the first person to ever tightrope Niagara Falls.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   It was over a quarter mile across, 160 feet up in the air, and he tightroped across.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   There he is. There's a newspaper thing from him tightroping across Niagara Falls, 1860s.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And he got so good at this that crowds would come out and they'd see him, and they'd see him walk across on the tightrope across Niagara Falls.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I mean, that's certain death if you fall.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He got so good that at one point he decided, hey, I'm going to do this blindfolded.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   He walked across blindfolded.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He's another great Blondine.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Then he was like, I need another challenge.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   He took stilts out, and he got stilts on.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   He walked across on stilts, the tightrope.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   At one point he got midway through, he decided, here's my next feat.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   He goes to the middle of the tightrope, walks halfway through.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   He brought a cooker and a skillet with him.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   He cooked an omelet, and he ate the omelet, and then walked across.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   This dude was like unreal, and crowds would show up to see him.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And at one point he decided to get out a wheelbarrow.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   He got the wheelbarrow.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   He began filling it with these bags of potatoes, potato sacks.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   And he walked the wheelbarrow, and he took this full wheelbarrow full of potato sacks, and he walked across Niagara Falls.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   And then he walked back, and the crowd's going crazy.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   And they're like, man, you're the great Blondine.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Unbelievable.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   And he looked into the crowd, and he says, who thinks I could take a person across the tightrope with me?
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   And the crowd, they're like, we believe in you.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   You're the great Blondine.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   You could do it.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   And he's like, who's willing to get in the wheelbarrow?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Silence.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Except for one person who stepped forward.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   And he got in the wheelbarrow, and he walked across, and he made it.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   There's a sharp difference between the person in the crowd who says, man, I believe, and the person who's willing to step out, get into the wheelbarrow, and say, I believe.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And I'm willing to act on it.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Inside of the room, there are many of you who are claiming to be Christians.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I would say hundreds, if not thousands, and yet your actions don't align with the words that you're saying.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   You are not choosing to date in line with God's will.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   You're not choosing to handle your life, your money, your time.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   And you would say, and you'd hide behind the fact that, hey, you're a good person.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And maybe by the world standards, you are a good person.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   That probably adds to even the problem, because you're like, yeah, you know, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Of course we're going to live together.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   That's just kind of what you do in this life stage.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Of course we're going to date this way.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   It's just what you do.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Of course I'm going to live this life and work this job.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   And you claim that, hey, Jesus is who he says he is.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   He's sovereign.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   He's in control.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   He's the one that leads life.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   His way is good, and everyone should follow him.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And yet you're not.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And you're sitting in the crowd saying, we believe.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   But you're not willing to act on it.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And you are forfeiting seeing what God will do, can do, and will do in your life.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   If you will trust him, you'll forfeit being a part of moving across Niagara Falls with your life in ways that you never could have even imagined.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Moving towards the marriage, the future, the man or the woman that God has for you, intends for you to be, that finds their security and strength in him.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   I trust him.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Others of you, as it relates to this idea of trust, you have never had a moment where you trusted that Jesus paid for your sin on the cross.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   He paid for everything you've ever done.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   He's the only way that you can have eternal life.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   That you've been given a free gift if you'll just accept it by God.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   And I'm putting all of my hopes, all of my trust, everything that I have.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   If I'm going to have eternal life, if I'm going to heaven when I die, it will only be because Jesus died in my place.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   He rose from the dead to show the payment cleared.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   And he was more than enough.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And I'm putting my trust, not in how good of a person I am, but in him.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   In him alone. I'm getting in the wheelbarrow.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   I can't do it alone.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   And I'm putting all of my trust in him.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   And the reason I know that you've never had that moment is when you're asked questions like, "Man, what do you think is going to happen?"
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Or, "Do you think that you'll have eternal life?"
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Or, "Do you think that you would spend eternity in heaven if something happened?"
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Lord willing, you say, "You know, I don't know. I just feel like I'm still working on my faith.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   I've done some bad things. I'm just trying to get my life right."
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   And you are trusting in yourself.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Do you see that?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   If you're someone who says, "Hey, God should accept me because I'm a pretty good person."
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   You're trusting in yourself.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   You're not trusting in the only way to have eternal life, the only way to experience on this earth the abundant life.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   You're trusting in yourself.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Whether you think you're good enough to have a relationship with God, or honestly more prevalent,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   those who think you're too bad for him to right now in this moment, in this seat that you're sitting in, accept you,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   based on nothing you will ever do, you will not ever be able to earn your way to heaven.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   No matter how long you go without looking at pornography, or without taking a hit,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   without getting drunk,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   you will never ever get there.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   No matter how many church services that you attend to get over that mistake that you made,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   some abuse you were part of, an abortion in your past, you will never get rid of it.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   The gap is too great, and you are trusting in yourself.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   And the God who's there says, "Man, I will carry you. I'm the only chance you got.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Will you trust in me?
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   I died in your place."
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   It's not good people in heaven and bad people in hell.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   It's forgiven people who go to heaven.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   There's only one way to get forgiveness.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Accepting it.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Accepting Jesus died in your place.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   He died the death you deserved.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   He lived a life that was impossible you never could have lived.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   As a free gift to make you the righteousness of God, that's what this Bible says.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   That he took your place.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   And you can keep being like, "Man, I just need to get some things straight if I'm going to have that type of certainty."
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   No, you don't.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   You need to trust in him.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Let me pray.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Father, thank you that you made him a nunosyn to become sin.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Jesus, to become like sin.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   So that in him, for anyone who accepts him,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   accept him as Lord and Savior.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   Savior of them.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   They would become the very righteousness of God.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   The label that is most true about them is that everything in their past, their present, and their future paid for.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And nothing they face, nothing they've done, nothing they will do can take that away.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I pray tonight, God, you would break the veils that I can't break, that no words could break, no songs could break.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   And you would allow people to, for the very first time, believe that.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   And for the rest of their life, they would walk in that truth and trust.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Not just in our words, but in our actions, God.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Would you make us a people whose confidence in you is great because our obedience to you is great, and we see his way is better.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   And it leads to life.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And we wouldn't forfeit, God, I just pray right now, specifically for friends in the room,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   and I don't know how many this represents, but who are in really dysfunctional relationships right now.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   And they're afraid to break up.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   But others around them, candidly, your word has said, like, this is not a healthy relationship.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   It would call them to do that.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   But they're afraid that you would move them to act, God.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And they wouldn't forfeit what you have for them.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   They wouldn't forfeit what could be for them.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   So in that way, and a thousand other ways, that when we choose to go our own way, we forfeit seeing you move, God,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   would you help us, strengthen us.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Thank you that you're a God who's defeated far more than an army of 120,000,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   but all sin everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, with everyone has been paid for.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   We worship you in song. Amen.
