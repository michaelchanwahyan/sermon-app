2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:29,860
 All right.

3
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,760
 Hey, welcome everybody in the room, everybody tuning in,

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,280

 PortsLive locations, Ports, Tulsa, Midland, Indy, Scottsdale,

 Boise, Houston, everywhere.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,540
 Welcome.

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,440
 We're continuing this series, His and Hers,

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,520
 and looking at a biblical perspective on dating.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,600
 We start this way.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,560
 I have been coaching my son's soccer team

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,200
 for the past three years.

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,320
 And we have successfully gone defeated, completely.

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,240
 We have not won a game.

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,120
 That is, until last Saturday.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,620
 OK?

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,840
 [APPLAUSE]

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,340
 Thank you.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,360
 That's it.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
 I'm closing prayer.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,920
 OK?

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,240
 So last Saturday, we finally had our win.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,480
 It was 4 to 2.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,640
 Yes, one of the goals that made up our 4

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,360
 was actually scored by the other team on themselves.

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,400
 But that doesn't matter, because we still

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
 would have won it 3 to 2.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,080
 And I've noticed something when I coach 6-year-old, 5-year-old,

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,080
 and 4-year-old soccer that happens every single game

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,360
 without fail.

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
 Midway through first quarter, second quarter,

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,240
 happens all throughout the game.

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,720
 One of the kids on the team will run up to me and just do this.

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
 And he looks at me, and he's stretching out his foot,

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,320
 and he's showing my shoes untied.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,200
 And so I say, hey, ref, timeout, bend over, tie his shoe,

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
 try to double knot it.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,520
 Inevitably, it'll come undone.

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
 And they almost rotate on who's going

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
 to have an untied shoe throughout the game.

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,680
 And if you're 6 and 5, it's normal,

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
 because a 6-year-old, they can't tie their shoe.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
 It's too complicated, which is why they often

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,640
 are wearing Velcro shoes, which apparently have come back,

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
 which is so bizarre.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
 But anyways, this will happen, and it's normal.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,120
 I mean, there's things that you, at some point,

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,080
 couldn't tie your shoe, and you had

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,800
 to have a grown-up or an adult come in and help

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,760
 you tie your shoes.

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,600
 And that is just one of many things that you have outgrown.

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,640
 And as you have grown in life, you have put behind you

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,760
 is no longer in your past.

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,480
 The things from your childhood, the things

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,600
 you used to play with, the way you used to think,

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,920
 the person you were, the things that mattered,

57
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
 your perspective on the opposite sex,

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,080
 it changes as you grow up.

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,840
 And I start there because the Apostle Paul,

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,120
 in 1 Corinthians chapter 13, he's talking about love.

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
 And at the end of this section on love,

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,720
 he brings up a very similar idea that's relevant

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,800
 to where we're going tonight, and to this idea

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,900
 of outgrowing from childhood.

65
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,840
 In other words, if you tomorrow at work,

66
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,240
 someone came up to you, and just like the 6-year-olds

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,960
 on my soccer team, they extended your foot in front of you,

68
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,560
 and they were like, "Hey, can you help me tie my shoe?"

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,640
 And it's your coworker or your friend at work,

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,200
 you'd be like, "Are you serious?

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,040
 "This is bizarre."

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,760
 'Cause you know and understand we grow out of things.

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,800
 And the Apostle Paul talks about love,

74
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,460
 and as he ends that section, he says,

75
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,140
 "When I was a child, I talked like a child.

76
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,060
 "I thought like a child, and I reasoned like a child.

77
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,180
 "But when I became a man,

78
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,720
 "I put the ways of childhood behind me."

79
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's a very simple idea, and so maybe you're wondering,

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,960
 what does that have to do with dating?

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,480
 Well, I think most of the challenges and problems

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,920
 and dysfunctional dating relationships that are represented

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
 in this room, maybe are a part of some of your story

84
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 and some of my story, are the result of never growing out

85
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,880
 and putting the ways of childhood behind you

86
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,360
 as it relates to dating.

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,600
 In other words, you no longer have to have somebody else

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
 tie your shoes, and a million other things

89
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,720
 that you have grown out of.

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
 But it seems like dating is the one arena

91
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,620
 across the board in society where we revert

92
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,440
 to childish ways of thinking and living.

93
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,720
 And now, we don't call it childish and dating,

94
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,420
 and nobody's ever told you, hey, you know what,

95
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,560
 the problem with all the different broken relations

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,520
 you have is it's just too childish.

97
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,280
 So it's childish dating.

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,160
 We have another term that we use to describe

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,480
 someone behaving childish in dating, and it's this word.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,980
 It's complicated.

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,300
 Oh man, dating, it's just, it's complicated.

102
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,900
 Are you and her, like, are y'all a thing?

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,100
 It's complicated.

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,940
 What happened?

105
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,500
 You guys were like together, and then did y'all break up?

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,720
 It's complicated.

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,580
 Now, why do I say that's childish?

108
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,440
 Well, if you take something that is designed for an adult,

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,340
 and you give it to a child, they will say,

110
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,680
 it's too complicated.

111
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,540
 You take shoes that are meant to be tied,

112
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,980
 and you hand it to a six-year-old, a child,

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,920
 and they'll go, it's too complicated.

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,060
 And for whatever reason, as it relates to dating,

115
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,860
 and love, and relationships,

116
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,620
 the reason we describe it as complicated

117
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,060
 is because of childish ways of thinking.

118
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,020
 Even as Paul lays out, hey, here's what it looks to have

119
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,020
 a mature perspective on love,

120
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,580
 which is what he says in 1 Corinthians 13,

121
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,380
 and he lists out, which is where the verse

122
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,420
 that I read a second ago ends.

123
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,060
 He says, love is patient.

124
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,980
 Here's a mature perspective on love.

125
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,360
 Love is kind, it doesn't envy or boast, it's not proud.

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,660
 Love doesn't dishonor others.

127
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,620
 It is not self-seeking.

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,180
 It's not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

129
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,060
 It doesn't delight in evil, but in the truth.

130
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,660
 It always protects, always trusts,

131
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,640
 always hopes, always perseveres.

132
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,220
 Love never fails.

133
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,740
 When I was a child, I thought like a child,

134
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,920
 talked like a child, reasoned.

135
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,820
 I became a man, put those ways behind me.

136
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,780
 And you think about childish behavior,

137
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,780
 it's, you know, they're not patient.

138
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,660
 If you've ever been around nieces, nephews, younger kids,

139
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,640
 I mean, they're anything but patient.

140
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,980
 They throw temper tantrums, they lose control.

141
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,620
 If they don't give it what they want,

142
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,440
 they're selfish, childlike behavior.

143
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,380
 And that's really what leads that type of behavior

144
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,780
 in adults in dating relationships leads

145
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,980
 to us describing something that God doesn't want

146
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,620
 to be complicated as it's complicated.

147
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,380
 So here's what I want to do tonight.

148
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,220
 Last week, we opened up and talked about,

149
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,620
 hey, these are three things to consider

150
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,380
 before you start dating.

151
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,100
 Tonight, for those of us in the room

152
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,140
 that are in a good place spiritually,

153
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,580
 with the Savior, with our Lord, we know Jesus,

154
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,100
 we're following Him, we're not perfect,

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,940
 but we are interested in honoring Him

156
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,020
 in our dating relationships,

157
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,340
 and in a place where we feel like we could date,

158
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,500
 I want to uncomplicate dating.

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,780
 We're gonna look at 10 things, so I'm gonna fly,

160
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,100
 but if you've ever wanted to have a dating relationship

161
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,680
 that is described not as complicated,

162
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,980
 but as healthy and life-giving

163
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,980
 and leading to a particular destination, this is for you.

164
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,700
 And so we're gonna spend the next 30 minutes

165
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,700
 on uncomplicating dating, uncomplicating dating.

166
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,540
 Before I do, if you are new

167
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,180
 or maybe not that familiar with the Bible,

168
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,700
 this may surprise you,

169
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,660
 but the Bible not a single time mentions dating.

170
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,100
 There's no occasions where it describes, you know,

171
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,140
 Joseph was picking up Mary on the camel

172
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,320
 and they were headed to Olive Garden

173
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,540
 and this is what happened there.

174
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,220
 'Cause dating is a relatively new invention.

175
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,060
 It's only been around 150 years, 100 years,

176
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,820
 around the same amount of time as the automobile.

177
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,540
 And so I wanna fly through even some of the history

178
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,500
 to put into context the history of dating,

179
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,140
 and then we're gonna launch into 10 things

180
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,780
 to uncomplicate your dating relationships.

181
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,700
 So dating was first used,

182
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,620
 it first appeared in literature in 1896.

183
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,920
 So this is just a brief history of even dating,

184
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,580
 how long it's been around, what it has involved.

185
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,780
 In 1896, it was used to describe in a slang way

186
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,740
 or a slang reference for prostitution.

187
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,380
 Going on a date was a euphemism for paying for sex.

188
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,060
 At that time, you didn't go on a date,

189
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,180
 arranged marriages happened,

190
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,140
 or you would court someone in front of their parents,

191
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,660
 at their parents' home.

192
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,660
 And as society began to change, that began to change.

193
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,580
 By the 1900s, courtship had switched into dating,

194
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,340
 and by 1930s, the invention of the automobile

195
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,820
 took relationships outside of the home.

196
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,600
 And dating became more and increasingly

197
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,480
 more and more normal.

198
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,660
 Even the invention and advent of makeup

199
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,660
 is beginning to take place and be partaken in

200
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,100
 widely at this time.

201
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,780
 Around the 1930s, a man would call on a girl

202
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,740
 and he would ask her to go out on a date.

203
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,380
 In the 1940s, the prevalence skyrocketed.

204
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,140
 It became the most common way that people

205
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,420
 would end up marrying someone around.

206
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,100
 A man would pick up a girl, drive her in the car,

207
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,160
 go on a date, and here we go.

208
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,060
 By the 1950s, the term going steady

209
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,460
 began to be used to describe not just going on dates,

210
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,900
 but hey, I am exclusively dating this person.

211
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,620
 In the 1960s, everything dramatically changed.

212
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,480
 Sexual revolution, which you may or may not

213
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,060
 be familiar with, but in the course of a short number

214
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,880
 of years, sex and the way that the American perspective

215
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,180
 on sexuality drastically changed.

216
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,540
 The invention and introduction of reliable birth control

217
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,100
 and the passing of Roe versus Wade

218
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,540
 took away the consequences of sex.

219
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,540
 In particular, it allowed sex to be taken

220
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,020
 outside of the context of marriage

221
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,140
 and it became coupled with dating.

222
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,460
 In the 1970s, Playboy comes onto the scene,

223
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,700
 it begins to alter and transform along with Hollywood

224
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,080
 and different perspectives,

225
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,380
 even how feminine beauty was perceived.

226
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,460
 By the 1980s, the internet is introduced,

227
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,520
 providing further outlets for sex appeal.

228
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,780
 Pornography comes along.

229
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,420
 By the 1990s, you have movies, music, Hollywood,

230
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,620
 which all play significant roles.

231
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,820
 The explosion of the rom-com in the late '90s.

232
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,720
 And then by the 2000s, we have the smartphone

233
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,340
 and dating apps and people are meeting more online

234
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,420
 than ever before.

235
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,660
 So that's a brief history.

236
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,060
 But unlike certain arenas, where over time

237
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,540
 we seem to be getting better,

238
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,100
 that doesn't appear to be the case in dating

239
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
 because it's complicated.

240
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,100
 And in our world, it feels like everywhere you look,

241
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,980
 everyone would describe it as just, it's a pain,

242
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,980
 it's brutal, it's something that is not done well.

243
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,300
 And God doesn't want that to be the case for you.

244
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,860
 And so we're gonna look at 10 principles

245
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,720
 that are really taking 1 Corinthians 13

246
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,580
 and the biblical commands to love, consider,

247
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,700
 honor, and care for one another

248
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,420
 and walk through how to apply those in a dating context.

249
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,380
 Y'all ready?

250
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,700
 So I'm gonna fly.

251
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,040
 First one, don't date just for fun.

252
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,540
 Don't date just for fun.

253
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,560
 This shouldn't need to be said,

254
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,420
 but what I don't mean is don't have fun in dating.

255
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,020
 You can have fun, should have fun in dating,

256
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,460
 but don't date just for fun.

257
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,060
 In other words, if you are dating someone

258
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,140
 with no purpose and no intention and no desire

259
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,260
 and no plan and no foreseeable marriage

260
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,060
 in your future at all, you're just dating

261
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,700
 'cause you're bored and you want attention

262
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,900
 from the opposite sex, you should not be dating.

263
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
 That's childlike thinking.

264
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,780
 And you're a follower of Jesus.

265
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,260
 You're putting the ways of childhood behind you.

266
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,580
 You're embracing a mature perspective on love.

267
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,200
 And it is not a mature or honoring thing

268
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,700
 to play with someone's heart and mess with their emotions

269
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,780
 and lead them on a journey if you have no intention

270
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,900
 of moving towards a destination

271
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,260
 with that person in that relationship.

272
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,140
 Dating, as I've said before, it's a path,

273
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,240
 like you're walking on it, that should lead to a place

274
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,420
 where there's a promise.

275
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,300
 That's you, white dress, him, black tux,

276
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,360
 standing in front of each other saying I do.

277
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,820
 That leads to a lifelong pursuit, path, promise, pursuit.

278
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,300
 If you are on that path and you are aimlessly

279
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,340
 and going nowhere, you are not ready to date.

280
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,640
 That's childlike thinking.

281
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,940
 But we, as followers of Jesus, we have a mature.

282
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,080
 So we see dating, dating is not just something for fun.

283
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,540
 Dating is meant to lead to a destination of marriage,

284
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,760
 and that informs how I continue in a relationship

285
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,420
 if I'm going to or if I see this relationship needs to end

286
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,660
 'cause it's not progressing.

287
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,700
 In other words, dating is like going to the airport.

288
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,460
 No one in the history of history has ever said,

289
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,580
 you know what, I'm bored this weekend.

290
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,280
 What do you say we go hang at the airport?

291
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,880
 Well, you're not going anywhere, you're not flying.

292
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
 I know, it's awesome.

293
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,700
 They got like the Annie Ann's pretzels in there

294
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,580
 and everything's four times as expensive

295
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,100
 as it is in the normal world,

296
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,500
 and we can just hang around and it'll be great.

297
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,460
 You never heard anybody say that, why?

298
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,420
 Because you only go to the airport

299
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,160
 as a step to get you towards your destination.

300
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,380
 Dating is something that you only go towards

301
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,620
 as a step to get you towards your destination.

302
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,680
 If you're not ready or marriage is off the table

303
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,660
 and that is something you don't have any interest in,

304
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,660
 or in the next 18 or so months, you would say,

305
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,140
 man, I just have no interest.

306
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,920
 I'm completely opposed to getting married in the near future.

307
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,420
 Then you shouldn't be dating.

308
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,540
 Proverbs chapter four says that you are to guard your heart

309
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,060
 and you take the scriptural principles

310
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,260
 from first Corinthians 13 of,

311
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,260
 hey, love honors the other person.

312
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,820
 It is not honoring to lead someone on with no intent

313
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,320
 of seeing that lead to a destination of marriage.

314
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,780
 For Christians, it's been said that dating

315
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,980
 without the intent of marriage

316
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,440
 is like shopping with no money.

317
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,920
 You either leave frustrated

318
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,280
 or taking something that doesn't belong to you.

319
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,080
 It's like you go to the mall and walking around Nordstrom's

320
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
 or going to whatever store you are

321
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,640
 and you're like, man, I don't have any money.

322
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,320
 You're either gonna be tempted to steal something

323
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,640
 that doesn't belong to you

324
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,440
 or you're just going to leave frustrated.

325
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,900
 And so is the case with dating,

326
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,280
 that dating is not something that we as believers in Christ

327
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,380
 do just for fun.

328
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,680
 As I said, don't date forever.

329
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,480
 It's my opinion that if getting married

330
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,960
 in the next 18 months is something

331
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,080
 you are totally opposed to,

332
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,900
 I'm not saying you're guaranteeing it has to happen,

333
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,640
 but you're going, man, I just have no interest

334
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,240
 in getting married anytime soon.

335
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,080
 Then you should have no interest in dating anytime soon.

336
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
 And that's okay.

337
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
 All right, number two.

338
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,720
 We've said this before, but it's worth repeating.

339
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,680
 And candidly, I wish I could spend an entire message

340
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,580
 just on this one.

341
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,880
 Men, ask women on dates.

342
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,400
 Ask women on dates.

343
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, let me, yeah, I saw that coming.

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
 Woo, yeah!

345
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 (audience laughing)

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,400
 If there is a godly girl,

347
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
 and you know her as a godly girl,

348
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
 and how, I'm not saying a stranger,

349
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,280
 I mean a godly girl, you're a godly guy

350
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,480
 and you have interest in dating,

351
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,440
 you're going to go up to her

352
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
 and you are going to ask her on a date.

353
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,840
 When you do, you're going to use the word date.

354
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,480
 You're going to give specific plans.

355
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,320
 You're going to go up to her and say,

356
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,800
 hey, Marissa, I would like to take you on a date.

357
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,040
 This next Saturday, Marissa, she is pumped.

358
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,920
 (audience laughing)

359
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,840
 In fact, stand up, Marissa,

360
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,720
 and we'll have everyone know where to go.

361
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,520
 Okay, you're going to go up to her

362
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,780
 and you're going to give a specific plan and intention.

363
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,920
 You're going to have thought it out.

364
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
 You're going to have a plan.

365
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,680
 You're going to go, Marissa, I'd like to take you on a date

366
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,500
 this Saturday to a Mavericks game.

367
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,540
 Afterwards, I'd like to go to dinner, or before.

368
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,960
 You're going to show her, I put time,

369
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,640
 I've thought about it, I have a plan,

370
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,880
 and I'm going to give her an out.

371
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 If you can't do it or you're not interested, that's okay.

372
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,600
 You honor her by giving clarity

373
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,580
 and you're allowing her to evaluate

374
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,480
 and decide what you're asking her.

375
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
 In other words, you're not just going to say,

376
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,000
 you got anything going on Saturday?

377
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,720
 Or are you in town next weekend?

378
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,360
 Or text her W-Y-D.

379
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,420
 You're going to ask her,

380
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,120
 I would like to take you on a date.

381
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,980
 And this is speaking to the guys

382
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,860
 who this is a godly girl in your life,

383
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,240
 and there's a lot of them, candidly.

384
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,040
 I wish I could just get all the guys

385
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,500
 who are already in a place

386
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,320
 and they're interested in dating

387
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,540
 and get together and charge you up and say,

388
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,060
 man, ask a godly girl on a date that you know.

389
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,180
 Not a beautiful girl that you know.

390
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,720
 So if you don't know her, you don't know if she's godly.

391
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,200
 You just saw her and like the way that she looks.

392
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,100
 I'm saying a godly girl that you know

393
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,940
 and have a relationship with and you go up to her,

394
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,820
 and is it going to risk rejection?

395
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,620
 Yes, and girls, you just need to know this.

396
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,340
 Guys, we don't like to risk rejection.

397
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,020
 We want to, as best we can, self-protect.

398
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,940
 But men, you are next level, you're mature love.

399
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,580
 You're not childish, kids are afraid of,

400
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,620
 they're gonna be childish.

401
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,900
 You're a man, you're gonna go up

402
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,180
 and you're gonna risk rejection.

403
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,620
 And you know what may happen?

404
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,060
 She may say no.

405
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:26,380
 And if she does, I am so proud

406
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,340
 that you honored her, you honored God,

407
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,900
 you brought clarity to the relationship,

408
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,780
 and you did it right, regardless of what she says.

409
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,300
 And you ask women on dates.

410
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,020
 Now, to the ladies, number three.

411
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,460
 Women, say yes to dates.

412
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,180
 (audience laughing)

413
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,020
 Hold on.

414
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,500
 Good night, everybody, all right.

415
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 Let me unpack what I mean,

416
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,700
 'cause I'm not just saying say yes to anybody.

417
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,900
 I'm saying you say yes to a date,

418
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
 not W-Y-D, not you up, not wanna watch Netflix on Saturday.

419
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,740
 You say yes to a date, and if a guy comes up to you

420
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,660
 and he asks you, and I mean a godly guy,

421
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,380
 it's my opinion, if a godly guy asked you on a date,

422
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,500
 I would say yes to a date.

423
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,180
 I wouldn't dial that down, I'm just giving my opinion.

424
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,680
 But if a godly guy comes up to you,

425
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,380
 or someone asks you on a date,

426
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,420
 or someone asks you, hey, are you in town next weekend?

427
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,680
 You look at them and say, are you asking me on a date,

428
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,540
 or just interested in my schedule?

429
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,020
 And you've forced him to drive clarity

430
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,720
 into that relationship, or into what he is asking.

431
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,520
 And you don't allow anyone to treat you with dishonor.

432
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,200
 That you force, hey, what are you asking me on?

433
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,600
 Is it okay for girls to ask guys on dates?

434
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
 Hold on, hold on.

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,860
 Y'all are something else tonight, man.

436
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:06,320
 Sure, there's no biblical verse that would prohibit that.

437
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,460
 In my opinion, I don't think that's best,

438
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,300
 and here's why.

439
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,000
 Because God has called and gives the husband,

440
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,600
 which he's not your husband,

441
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,600
 the responsibility to lead, and love, and serve,

442
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,560
 and leadership biblically is servant,

443
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,260
 or being a servant, chief servant.

444
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,560
 And part of the reason I think that's not ideal,

445
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,840
 in my opinion, is it could increase and create a culture

446
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,520
 that increases passivity on men.

447
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,060
 And God is calling men, men, just like with women,

448
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,580
 not to be childish.

449
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,220
 Remember, we put the ways of childhood behind us.

450
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,020
 We can tie our shoes, we can learn how to date,

451
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,100
 like mature followers of Jesus.

452
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,520
 And so in my opinion, it's not ideal.

453
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,580
 But there's no thou shall not ask a guy out.

454
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,700
 I just don't think it is ideal, and men,

455
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,980
 man, tonight may be your chance.

456
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,380
 You step up, you find Marissa, or whoever she is,

457
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,140
 and you go.

458
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,140
 All right, number three, or number four, I'm sorry.

459
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,460
 Communicate intentionally.

460
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,220
 Communicate intentionally along the path,

461
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,580
 at the first date, along the dating relationship

462
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,820
 as it progresses, not intensely, not first date.

463
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,380
 Hey, you know, I'd like to have 17 children,

464
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,340
 and one of them would be Jeremiah,

465
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,180
 and the other one would be Nehemiah,

466
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,660
 and the other one, no, you don't do that, bro.

467
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,220
 That is a recipe for no second date.

468
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,020
 You communicate intentionally and thoughtfully.

469
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,820
 I'd like to take you on a date.

470
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,260
 And then along as the relationship progresses,

471
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,700
 and you communicate intentionally,

472
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,100
 and here's a big one, ready?

473
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,740
 Honestly.

474
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,220
 In other words, when that date is finishing up,

475
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,420
 and let me talk to guys and girls.

476
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,660
 The date is finishing up.

477
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,740
 If you don't wanna take her on a second date,

478
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,660
 you don't say, I'll call you,

479
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,700
 or I'd like to take you on a second date.

480
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,020
 You don't lie.

481
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,940
 And this is pretty one-on-one stuff,

482
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,500
 but we often, because we're afraid

483
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 of hurting somebody's feelings, it just kinda slips out,

484
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,900
 but you're a follower of Jesus, you don't lie.

485
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,220
 Liars lie.

486
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,980
 You're not a liar.

487
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,220
 You're a follower of Jesus.

488
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,100
 And so if that's not true, then you don't say that.

489
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,620
 And girls, same with you.

490
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,340
 That if he says, I had a great time,

491
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,860
 I really would like to take you on a second date,

492
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,860
 if you don't want to, or you're not sure, you say that.

493
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,900
 I'd love some time to think about it.

494
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,780
 You don't lie, you don't ghost and say, yeah, great,

495
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,340
 and then for six months, you're just disappeared.

496
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,480
 You're a follower of Jesus,

497
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,620
 and we put the ways of childhood behind us.

498
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,540
 And so we communicate honestly and intentionally

499
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,460
 along the way as the relationship progresses,

500
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,300
 and at some point, it moves from a date to dating.

501
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,000
 You go from noun to verb.

502
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,940
 You're gonna have to have what's called a DTR.

503
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,020
 We can't spend a ton of time here,

504
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,580
 but you're gonna define the relationship,

505
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,620
 and you're gonna sit down.

506
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,300
 And if along that journey, you, either side,

507
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,580
 either party begins to go,

508
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,500
 I just don't think this relationship should continue,

509
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,920
 you communicate that, and you honor them.

510
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,740
 We're so afraid of hurting someone else's feelings,

511
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,380
 and we think it's wrong if I hurt someone's feelings.

512
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,300
 If you are sharing the truth and loving them,

513
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,140
 you are honoring them by not wasting

514
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,980
 and dragging something on and not suggesting,

515
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,380
 well, they can't handle the truth.

516
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,940
 No, you honor them, and you share what is true.

517
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,980
 You sit them down at some point,

518
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,140
 if the relationship progresses,

519
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,540
 and guys, you can initiate,

520
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,680
 here's where I see this relationship going.

521
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
 I don't know that we're gonna get married,

522
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,300
 but you at least have a lot of the characteristics

523
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,780
 of someone that I would like to marry,

524
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,580
 and I'd like to continue pursuing you

525
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,140
 and make you exclusively my girlfriend.

526
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,060
 And you use the word girlfriend.

527
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,260
 That doesn't matter to you.

528
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,520
 May not matter to every girl,

529
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,260
 but you're driving clarity into the relationship

530
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,580
 of who you are, where I see this going,

531
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,740
 and you just honor one another throughout the entire process

532
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,700
 as the relationship continues.

533
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,500
 The scripture said, we just read it,

534
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,700
 love rejoices in the truth.

535
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,960
 We don't lie.

536
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,620
 Number five, we don't play games.

537
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,520
 Games are for children.

538
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,380
 You're not a child.

539
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,440
 You're a follower of Jesus

540
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,020
 who's embracing a mature perspective on love,

541
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,980
 and this is big.

542
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,340
 Nobody in the room probably is like,

543
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,060
 yeah, I'm a big game player, big gamer.

544
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,460
 Well, in other ways, maybe they do that,

545
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,020
 but as it relates to dating, here's what this looks like.

546
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,860
 And we've been so bombarded

547
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,060
 by such childish ways of thinking,

548
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,040
 and we don't even recognize them as childish.

549
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,640
 We recognize them as honestly, how you do it.

550
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,340
 Like if they text you,

551
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,620
 you wait like 15 minutes before they text back,

552
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,020
 and if they wait 20 minutes, then you wait 25 minutes,

553
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,020
 and you continue to not show too much interest.

554
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,660
 I gotta play a little hard to get.

555
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,220
 I mean, some of you, candidly,

556
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,540
 you've been so brainwashed by the world around us

557
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,980
 that if he honors you, communicates well,

558
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,620
 is intentional in his words, tells you the truth,

559
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,540
 responds in a way that's actually consistent

560
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,540
 with his reality, it's like, oh, oh, man, I don't know.

561
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,500
 That is weird.

562
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,700
 That's weird.

563
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,820
 That's childish.

564
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,760
 That is childish thinking,

565
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,700
 and I'm not here to throw shade.

566
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,860
 I'm here to say, man, you have it.

567
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,460
 You've got what it takes,

568
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,460
 and you're gonna honor one another.

569
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,580
 You're not gonna play games and lead people on.

570
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,300
 The scriptures say, the reason why we play games,

571
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,860
 play hard to get, don't wanna seem desperate,

572
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,660
 make them work harder, is control.

573
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,260
 We wanna feel like we're in the driver's seat.

574
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
 We're afraid of being vulnerable.

575
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,100
 We're afraid of being hurt.

576
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,660
 We're afraid of rejection, so I wanna have control,

577
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,320
 self-protection, and 1 Corinthians, the verse we read,

578
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,780
 it says love is not self-focused,

579
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,140
 self-centered, self-protecting

580
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,900
 at the expense of the other person.

581
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,820
 That you don't play games,

582
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,800
 and you don't tolerate somebody who plays games.

583
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,780
 The saying of, man, you play stupid games,

584
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,600
 you win stupid prizes, is so appropriate inside of dating

585
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,900
 that if you embrace worldly ways of thinking,

586
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,580
 it leads to worldly pain,

587
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,180
 and worldly types of relationships.

588
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,100
 And remember, we put those away,

589
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,140
 the ways of childhood behind us.

590
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,940
 The adage of don't hate the player, hate the game.

591
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,980
 For us, it's, man, you don't date the player,

592
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,900
 and we don't play games.

593
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,980
 All right, number six.

594
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,420
 Keep sex out of the relationship.

595
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,480
 Keep sex out of the relationship.

596
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,100
 God designed and created sex.

597
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
 He's so for it, and he gave this incredible gift

598
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,740
 for the context of marriage.

599
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,580
 And if that's something that has been a part of your story,

600
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,100
 and like me, have sexual sin in your past,

601
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,340
 God isn't done with you.

602
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,980
 But when you think about the future,

603
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,260
 and the love story he's gonna write,

604
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,020
 maybe the love story he is writing,

605
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,520
 you want it to include, man,

606
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,340
 I'm keeping sex saved for marriage.

607
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,900
 I'm prioritizing, or I'm pursuing,

608
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,660
 even if you haven't in the past,

609
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,180
 going forward, I'm going to.

610
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,500
 Hebrews chapter 13, verse four says,

611
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,700
 "Marriage should be honored by all.

612
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,740
 "The marriage bed should be kept pure."

613
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,660
 Here's what's interesting about sex,

614
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,460
 is we talk about complicating.

615
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,620
 Sex, as I said last week,

616
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,420
 it doesn't make strong relationships.

617
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,500
 Sex makes babies.

618
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,300
 And sex doesn't bring clarity in a dating context.

619
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,420
 It complicates it.

620
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,040
 Because God created this amazing gift

621
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,040
 to be so powerful that it would be intoxicating,

622
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,460
 like alcohol, or like a substance that intoxicates.

623
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,300
 In other words, the scriptures say in Proverbs chapter five,

624
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,940
 he's discussing marriage, and he says,

625
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,060
 "May your fountain always be blessed.

626
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,760
 "May you always rejoice in the wife of your youth,

627
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 "a loving doe, graceful dear.

628
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,500
 "May her breasts satisfy you always."

629
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,340
 Ready?

630
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,440
 "May you be ever intoxicated with her love.

631
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,460
 "Would you be drunk in her love?"

632
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,980
 Beyonce didn't come up with drunk in love.

633
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,940
 King Solomon came up with drunk in love.

634
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,060
 And he said, "Will you always be drunk in your wife's love?"

635
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,180
 That's what I just said.

636
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,500
 That sex, it's intoxicating.

637
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,060
 In other words, the reason it's dangerous

638
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,700
 in a dating context is it decreases your ability

639
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,660
 to accurately evaluate, is this the type of person

640
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,540
 that's gonna make a great mom,

641
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,460
 that's gonna make a great husband,

642
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,620
 that's gonna make a great father, that I want to marry?

643
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,220
 Does this person have the characteristics

644
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,900
 of someone God says to marry?

645
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,740
 Or have we just introduced sex?

646
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,140
 And had we not, this relationship

647
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,980
 would have broken up at three months.

648
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,660
 But now it's been three years.

649
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,980
 Because we introduced a soul tie.

650
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,820
 What's a soul tie?

651
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,580
 It's God's design for sex would be

652
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,640
 that it impacts the most intimate, soul-level part of you.

653
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,500
 And we introduced that, and it's like, man, we're connected.

654
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:07,060
 And God, who loves you, wants you to experience

655
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,460
 all the amazing gift of sex,

656
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,660
 but in the context of marriage.

657
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,060
 It's like this, my friend Trey's gonna come up here,

658
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,740
 and let me show an illustration of what it does.

659
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,260
 I don't know if y'all had in driver's ed

660
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,220
 something called drunk goggles.

661
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
 You remember these?

662
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,060
 They still exist.

663
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,420
 Maybe some of you had 'em, some of you didn't.

664
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,580
 This simulates the perspective of somebody,

665
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,540
 hey, give it up for Trey.

666
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,540
 Can we say thank you to Trey?

667
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,700
 Here we go.

668
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,460
 Looking sharp, dapper, all right.

669
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,900
 Trey, I want you to just catch one of these balls,

670
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,960
 no pressure, just without it.

671
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,420
 On, okay, now put the goggles on.

672
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:49,700
 And this simulates someone being intoxicated,

673
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,340
 and now let's see what happens, okay?

674
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,780
 Good try, okay, that's all right, there we go.

675
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,780
 Man, this is not going, okay, man, it's swinging a miss.

676
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,540
 Okay, there we go.

677
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,140
 My point is, immediately you introduced that,

678
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,780
 thank you Trey, give it up for Trey, all right.

679
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,780
 (audience cheering)

680
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
 Something that was so simple,

681
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,360
 all of a sudden became so complicated

682
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,660
 and complex and difficult.

683
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,640
 And when you introduce sex into a relationship,

684
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,600
 it doesn't bring clarity, it makes things more complicated.

685
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,920
 Because it's introducing this powerful force that God said,

686
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,160
 it's intoxicating.

687
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
 Like you think, man, you're in love,

688
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,300
 and we're married in God's eyes,

689
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,140
 and I think they're the one.

690
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,400
 No, you just had sex, and they don't have the character

691
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,820
 that God says to look for.

692
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,540
 But you're under the influence

693
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,980
 of bringing that into the relationship.

694
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,460
 It's my opinion, this is just my opinion.

695
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,300
 I would delay any sort of physical interaction

696
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,580
 as long as possible.

697
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,460
 Certainly sex, but I'm talking kissing, making out,

698
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,420
 and I know, right now I just lost everybody,

699
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,020
 like, okay, it's official,

700
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,740
 David does not live in the real world

701
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,220
 with the rest of us humans,

702
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,740
 lives in some closet back there,

703
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,940
 and never comes out, except for on Tuesday nights.

704
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,580
 (audience laughing)

705
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,460
 I have never heard a couple say,

706
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,880
 you know, our one regret in dating

707
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,920
 is we just didn't make out enough.

708
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,600
 And you know what's not happening when you're making out?

709
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,640
 You're not learning anything about them,

710
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,180
 other than like what they just ate for dinner.

711
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,400
 (audience laughing)

712
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,400
 It's just my opinion, I would delay it as long as possible,

713
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,520
 and consider maybe towards marriage, until marriage.

714
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,020
 Okay, I gotta keep moving.

715
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,860
 Number seven.

716
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
 Oof, man.

717
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,600
 I wanna be very clear on every word I'm about to say.

718
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,680
 And don't clap.

719
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:50,340
 You don't need deep friendships

720
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:57,220
 or relationships with someone of the opposite sex.

721
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:00,880
 Now let me, okay, yeah, I saw that coming.

722
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,340
 Now let me clear it up,

723
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,880
 let me make sure you hear what I'm saying.

724
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
 Hey, if you're dating someone,

725
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,600
 you should have a friendship.

726
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,840
 Healthy marriages are built on friendships together.

727
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,280
 What I am saying is very intentional every word.

728
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,280
 You don't need, if you need lots of deep friendships,

729
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:21,400
 if you're a girl with lots of guys of the opposite sex,

730
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,780
 those are your go-to, those are the closest people you have.

731
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,960
 If you need that, there's something not right there.

732
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,520
 If you're a guy and you need that,

733
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,500
 the closest emotional connections

734
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,240
 and who you talk to when it's a hard day

735
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,360
 and who you lean on is not other guys in your life

736
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,960
 'cause you're a guy, it's other girls in your life.

737
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,560
 I just think it's unwise.

738
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,000
 And so let me be very clear on why I'm saying all of that.

739
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,400
 It introduces potentially a friendationship.

740
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,480
 In other words, man, I've been doing this 12 years

741
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,320
 at the porch.

742
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,920
 And every relationship between a guy and a girl

743
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,440
 and somebody's gonna email me, I know,

744
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,680
 and somebody's gonna come down in front of me like,

745
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,880
 this is Sharla, I'm Steve, we're best friends.

746
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,860
 That's gonna happen.

747
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,360
 In my opinion, I've seen it over and over and over.

748
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,680
 One of the people in that close, hey, we're so close,

749
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,320
 one of the people is like, oh, dude,

750
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,080
 she's straight friend zone, there's nothing.

751
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,440
 And she's over there going, yeah, I'm friend zone,

752
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,160
 but I would love to not be.

753
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,160
 And maybe over time, we're gonna look up and go,

754
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,200
 man, I've loved you.

755
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,080
 And they've thought that or have some inkling of that.

756
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
 It just is unnecessarily playing with fire.

757
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,160
 And you're called as a Christian.

758
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 Remember, we put childish ways behind us

759
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,680
 to honor the other person

760
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,760
 and seek to be considerate of the other person.

761
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,840
 And some of us in the room, just if you were honest,

762
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,400
 man, you have lots of those relationships

763
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,560
 and emotionally flirtatious relationships,

764
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,880
 emotionally borderline dating relationships,

765
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,120
 and you even have a boyfriend or girlfriend.

766
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,200
 But you turn to those to fill some insecurity

767
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,960
 or some itch or to scratch something

768
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,480
 that may reflect something that's not healthy.

769
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,720
 And here's my full disclosure.

770
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,520
 Again, this is my opinion.

771
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,800
 I don't think a guy and girl

772
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,480
 can have a deep platonic friendship.

773
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,800
 It's just my take, my take, my opinion,

774
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,320
 that a deep, nothing there without something

775
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,960
 in someone's heart potentially getting misled.

776
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,880
 But you don't need lots of those types of relationships.

777
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,760
 And ladies, here's the other thing.

778
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,480
 Some of the guys in the room, you just may be naive.

779
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,600
 Like I was naive for so many,

780
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,160
 I look back and I just was an idiot like in college.

781
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,720
 I just, my prefrontal cortex had not developed or something.

782
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,600
 Like I remember I was taking a girl on a date

783
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,960
 and she was like, oh, I don't think that we can.

784
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,480
 I mean, you're dating my friend.

785
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,520
 And I was like, what?

786
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,420
 I'm not dating your friend.

787
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,740
 I had no idea what she was talking about.

788
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,720
 She was like, oh, you know.

789
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,120
 And I was like, no, I have no idea

790
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:52,960
 what you're talking about.

791
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,200
 She stepped outside, called this girl,

792
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,740
 and she was like, she's gonna come over, I'm leaving.

793
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,660
 And I was going, I have no idea

794
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,900
 who is about to come over right now.

795
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,320
 Like zero, zero idea.

796
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,300
 I go outside of my house on the front porch

797
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,220
 and I look and it's like a movie scene.

798
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,000
 This truck or car pulls up and I just see the car lights

799
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,580
 and I'm like, I have no idea.

800
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,260
 I mean, I have no idea who's about to come out

801
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,100
 of this car right now.

802
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,780
 And the silhouette of a person walks up

803
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,840
 and she was like, yeah, I thought we were dating.

804
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,700
 Which it maybe is equally on her.

805
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,620
 I thought you were interested in putting that out there.

806
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,340
 And sometimes it's just guys, naively,

807
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,500
 when you're hanging out or you're texting her

808
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,380
 or you're asking her about her day

809
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,900
 or you're asking, hey, do you wanna come with me

810
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,440
 to that Mavs game?

811
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,080
 She doesn't see it as you're a big Luka fan, me too.

812
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,340
 She sees it as, I think he's asking me on a date

813
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,620
 or something is going on there.

814
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,780
 And so it may be just a reflection of naivety.

815
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,860
 I just wanna proceed with caution.

816
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,520
 Number eight, invite outside counsel.

817
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,980
 Invite outside counsel.

818
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,420
 Don't isolate the relationship.

819
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,100
 Proverbs 15, 22 says, plans fail for lack of counsel.

820
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,220
 If you have plans to get married,

821
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,140
 have a successful dating relationship,

822
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,120
 honor each other and date well.

823
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,480
 Those types of plans fail for lack of counsel

824
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,980
 or wise counselors.

825
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,400
 But with many advisors, they succeed.

826
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,140
 That you decide, you wanna complicate dating relationships?

827
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,020
 If you wanna complicate it, then you and her,

828
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,900
 you just go off and as soon as you start dating,

829
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,120
 you only hang out with each other,

830
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,360
 you're never around other people,

831
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,140
 you just become the couple that totally isolates.

832
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,840
 But if you wanna have uncomplicated dating,

833
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,360
 you're gonna involve your community group.

834
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,120
 You're gonna involve trusted followers of Jesus

835
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,960
 in your life.

836
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,440
 You're gonna ask, hey, is there anything that you see

837
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,480
 or any hesitations you have on this relationship

838
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,680
 continuing going forward?

839
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,060
 Do you think I'm in a good place to date?

840
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,360
 You're gonna ask questions like that.

841
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,960
 You're gonna involve and invite outside counsel

842
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,060
 to speak into that relationship

843
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,100
 as a protection for you and for them.

844
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,460
 Proverbs 18, chapter, Proverbs 18, verse one says,

845
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,220
 "Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire.

846
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,620
 "He breaks out against all sound judgment."

847
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,740
 That if you're the only person who likes your relationship,

848
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,540
 or you and her, that should be a red flag.

849
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,820
 And you're gonna invite outside counsel.

850
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,820
 All right, number nine, don't be afraid to break up.

851
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:28,160
 If at some point along the dating relationship,

852
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,340
 you find yourself confident

853
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,780
 this relationship shouldn't move forward,

854
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,200
 or in a season of doubting and questioning

855
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,940
 and really wrestling or identifying characteristics

856
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,340
 that give you pause and concern,

857
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,640
 don't be afraid to end the relationship.

858
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,880
 But when you do, you're gonna honor one another

859
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,940
 in how you do that.

860
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,500
 You're gonna go in person.

861
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,660
 You don't break up.

862
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,580
 No relationship should be ever broken up

863
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,940
 through text messaging,

864
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,340
 or any other form of digital communication

865
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,560
 that includes emojis, okay?

866
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,580
 You're gonna go in person

867
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,180
 and do what Philippians chapter two said,

868
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,940
 which is do nothing out of selfish ambition,

869
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,620
 but with humility, consider the interests of others

870
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,300
 more important than yourselves.

871
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,100
 You are going to put the interest

872
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,340
 in this other person before yourself,

873
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,740
 and you're gonna communicate,

874
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,220
 and you're gonna sit them down,

875
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,060
 and you're gonna say, "Thank you for the time

876
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,900
 "and ways you've invested in this relationship."

877
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,120
 Or if you're the guy, you're gonna say,

878
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,460
 "Hey, I've really enjoyed," or say whatever's true.

879
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,260
 "Thank you for taking the time

880
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,820
 "to go on the dates we have been on,

881
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,400
 "for the relationship that we have had.

882
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,460
 "I no longer feel confident moving forward

883
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,340
 "and need to break up our relationship."

884
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,780
 If you're the girl, you're gonna sit them down,

885
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,980
 and you're gonna say whatever's true and honor them.

886
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,360
 "Thank you for taking me on dates

887
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,480
 "in the way that you have cared for,

888
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,220
 "or the way you have led, communicated,"

889
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,420
 whatever is true,

890
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,380
 and you're gonna look them in the eye and share,

891
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,720
 "I, as I've processed, been praying,"

892
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,460
 maybe you'd share with your community group,

893
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:25,340
 "I'm no longer comfortable moving this relationship forward

894
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:30,400
 "and need to break up," and you honor them.

895
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,900
 You don't blame God.

896
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,160
 You don't go up to them and be like,

897
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,540
 "Look, I just think God is telling me we need to break up."

898
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,220
 I mean, think about how many times that's done,

899
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,500
 and God is in heaven being like, "No, I didn't.

900
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,200
 "No, no, that's just Him.

901
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,900
 "He just doesn't, no."

902
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,000
 You don't blame God.

903
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,340
 You say, "I'm not comfortable."

904
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,420
 And the thing that's hard is, as Christians,

905
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,660
 we don't like hurting people's feelings.

906
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,780
 We're afraid of that, but you're honoring them

907
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,380
 by saying it would be unloving and dishonoring

908
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,340
 to continue going forward in a relationship

909
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,460
 I don't see moving forward.

910
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,460
 And so I'm gonna choose to honor you,

911
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,680
 and breaking up is hard, but can I just tell you this?

912
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,180
 If you will actually do the uncomplicated dating,

913
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,680
 it won't be easy, 'cause breaking up is never easy,

914
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,280
 but your breakup won't break you,

915
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,100
 because you have protected your sexuality,

916
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,260
 you have sought to honor them along the way,

917
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,440
 you've communicated honestly and clearly along that journey.

918
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,280
 You haven't played games.

919
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,520
 Remember, kids play games.

920
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,920
 You're a follower of Jesus.

921
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,040
 You told the truth, and it won't be easy,

922
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,200
 'cause it's never easy,

923
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,800
 but it is something that God will get you through,

924
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,460
 and it won't break you, like so many breakups do.

925
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,720
 When you date childishly.

926
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,480
 Finally, we understand, number 10,

927
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,280
 that marriage is ultimately about Jesus.

928
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,760
 If you wanna uncomplicate dating,

929
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,440
 we make it so complicated, and there's so many feels,

930
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,580
 and what am I thinking, what's he thinking?

931
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,200
 As it relates to dating as a path to a promise on an altar,

932
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,120
 that's a wedding, to a lifelong pursuit, that's a marriage,

933
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,600
 I understand that at the end of the day,

934
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,280
 the thing that marriage is about

935
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,020
 is the same thing life is about,

936
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,080
 which is Jesus, and knowing Jesus,

937
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,840
 and being in a covenant relationship.

938
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,520
 I'm gonna explain that in a second with Jesus.

939
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,440
 The marriage, at the end of the day, it's not about you.

940
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,200
 Life is not about you, and finding love,

941
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,640
 and living happily ever after, and Prince Charming,

942
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
 that life, at the end of the day, and it's easy for me,

943
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
 and you're married, it's easy for you to say,

944
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,000
 if you wanna have an uncomplicated dating relationship,

945
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,040
 you have gotta be informed

946
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,080
 that marriage is not about just that marriage.

947
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,640
 It's ultimately a picture

948
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,480
 that is intended to point us to how God loves

949
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,280
 and keeps his promises to his people.

950
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
 So Paul defines it as.

951
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,720
 In other words, it's like marriage is a picture,

952
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,160
 this is a picture that sits on my desk, it's my wife,

953
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,820
 from the day that we got married.

954
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,880
 And it's a beautiful picture, it's an awesome picture,

955
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,640
 I love this picture,

956
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,440
 but you know what is so much better than this picture?

957
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,720
 Her, like physical, breathing, living, her.

958
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,140
 That a picture is nothing,

959
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,620
 pales in comparison to the person.

960
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,180
 And marriage is meant to be this picture

961
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,980
 that points to ultimately the person of Christ

962
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,500
 and his love, his covenant.

963
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,520
 Covenant is a relationship and a entered into bond

964
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,420
 that ends in death do you part, or only ends in death,

965
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,080
 or in Christ, eternally, has been set.

966
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,180
 For anyone who believes in Christ.

967
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,180
 In other words, Paul would say in Ephesians chapter five,

968
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,340
 he's describing marriage.

969
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,900
 I read these words at every wedding I've ever done.

970
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,700
 And he says something profound about marriage.

971
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,800
 He says, "For this reason," talking about marriage,

972
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,520
 "a man will leave his father and mother

973
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,140
 "and be united to his wife."

974
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,380
 And when this happens, something crazy happens.

975
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,640
 "The two become one flesh."

976
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,480
 Man, how does that happen?

977
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,040
 You've got two people that yesterday

978
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,500
 was Sam and Sarah and now is one flesh.

979
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,200
 And then he says, "This is a profound mystery."

980
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,460
 And up to that point, you're like,

981
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,700
 "Yeah, man, that is profound."

982
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,620
 Two becoming one.

983
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,900
 And then he takes a turn.

984
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:22,860
 But I'm talking about Christ and his church.

985
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,580
 Paul is saying, "Hey, the reason God is so passionate

986
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,840
 "about marriage, the reason marriage and that covenant

987
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,120
 "and that marriage is a death do us part,

988
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,320
 "we are in it for the long haul, for better or worse,

989
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,760
 "that God is so passionate of our understanding of marriage,

990
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,600
 "is because," he says, "it ultimately is meant to point,

991
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,140
 "every human earthly marriage is meant to point

992
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,140
 "and be a small reflection of the point of marriage,

993
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,460
 "which is his covenant-keeping love

994
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,120
 "and relationship with his bride,

995
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,740
 "which is the body of Christ."

996
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,220
 Ultimately, it is a picture.

997
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,060
 And it is only in knowing that picture

998
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,940
 that you understand, hey, just like God never gives up,

999
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,100
 never abandons, never walks away.

1000
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,700
 He run towards me, despite the fact that I don't deserve it.

1001
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,940
 That's how I am to love and serve my wife,

1002
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,780
 like Christ has loved and served me, laying down his life.

1003
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,460
 That's how I'm to love and serve my wife.

1004
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,620
 And she understands that just like Christ loved and served,

1005
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,380
 I'm to prioritize and serve and love

1006
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,340
 and put the needs of the other person in front of me.

1007
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,040
 And if you don't understand that,

1008
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,700
 you've got a childish way of thinking about marriage.

1009
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,720
 Fairy tales are fun to read, but they're childish.

1010
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,760
 Our understanding of marriage

1011
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,320
 is so much more beautiful and profound.

1012
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,800
 And it comes from an understanding that in Christ,

1013
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,360
 anyone who's accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior,

1014
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,200
 they've trusted in him as the payment on their sin.

1015
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,780
 2,000 years, you may have never heard of this before.

1016
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,880
 Jesus showed up, God in human flesh.

1017
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,160
 He walked on the planet and he went to a cross

1018
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,680
 and he died on behalf of every person who has ever lived,

1019
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,960
 every sin in your present,

1020
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,800
 everything you don't even wanna ever share

1021
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,400
 with the person that you're dating.

1022
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,180
 Everything in your past, everything in your future,

1023
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,520
 all of it on a cross, he said,

1024
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,960
 "I will be killed and crucified and die

1025
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,860
 so that they will have a payment for their sin."

1026
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,840
 And anyone who trusts in what he did on the cross,

1027
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,640
 not I'm trusting in, man, I'm a good person,

1028
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,280
 pay my taxes, try to be nice.

1029
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,800
 I give to homeless people from time to time.

1030
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,280
 Read my Bible.

1031
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,480
 I'm sure God and me are good.

1032
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,600
 Nope, wrong answer.

1033
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,140
 The Bible says there are no good people.

1034
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,680
 You cannot be good enough to reach eternity

1035
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,920
 or to go to heaven, but you don't have to.

1036
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,600
 Jesus came and died in your place.

1037
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,880
 Everything wrong, everything broken,

1038
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,080
 every relational dysfunction,

1039
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,720
 every type of sin in this life and in my life paid for.

1040
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,600
 And when you trust in him,

1041
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,880
 you are now entered into this eternal,

1042
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,360
 unstoppable, unending covenant with Jesus

1043
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,000
 alongside of the people of God,

1044
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,680
 that's followers of Jesus.

1045
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,840
 Ultimately, what marriage is all about.

1046
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,380
 If I could boil down and really when it comes to dating,

1047
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,960
 Paul is just expanding what it means to be loving,

1048
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,560
 to honor, to care,

1049
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,120
 to understand the value and worth of somebody else.

1050
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,160
 And in a culture that is so toxic,

1051
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,240
 as followers of Christ, we know the value of our life

1052
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,280
 and the value of those that we date and are around

1053
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,600
 and every person sitting next to you

1054
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,720
 and every person you'll ever date,

1055
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,680
 every person that will be married here.

1056
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,300
 My wife and I were buying, I'll close here.

1057
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,880
 We were buying a mattress like two years ago.

1058
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,880
 We just had gone through and it'd been eight years.

1059
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,400
 It just was time to get a mattress.

1060
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,800
 And it was COVID and so we decided we were gonna try

1061
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,000
 one of these online, you buy the mattress

1062
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
 and they mail it to your doorstep.

1063
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,240
 And they come with these guarantees

1064
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,560
 that if you don't like it,

1065
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,160
 you can sleep on it for 180 days

1066
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,720
 or extended amount of time.

1067
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,560
 And if you don't want it,

1068
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,640
 you can have 100% money back guarantee.

1069
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,320
 It's like, man, that feels like no risk, let's do it.

1070
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,000
 And we purchased this mattress and like three days in,

1071
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,400
 it just was like, man, it's too, it's uncomfortable.

1072
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,280
 This is not for us.

1073
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,720
 I call up the company and say, hey, we wanna exchange.

1074
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,280
 We wanna take you up on the money back guarantee,

1075
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,100
 the refund.

1076
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,480
 And they said, okay, great, we will refund you

1077
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,920
 and you are only responsible to take the mattress

1078
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,960
 and donate it to a Goodwill

1079
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,800
 or donate it to some sort of secondhand.

1080
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,480
 You just have to donate it to somebody.

1081
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,040
 And I was going, wait a second,

1082
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,400
 you're not even coming to pick up the mattress?

1083
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,680
 We just have to get rid of it?

1084
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,360
 And they were like, yeah, you just have to send us a proof

1085
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,560
 of receipt that you donated it to somewhere.

1086
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,800
 And I remember thinking,

1087
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,560
 because we slept on it for three days,

1088
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,480
 it's now of so little value to you

1089
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,300
 that it's not even worth your time to pick up

1090
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,800
 or send somebody to get it?

1091
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,540
 And what's so sad is so many of us have lived in a world

1092
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,300
 where that's how people think about sexuality.

1093
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,500
 Hey, I'm damaged goods.

1094
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,220
 I've been slept with or they've slept with somebody

1095
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,760
 or as it relates to sleeping on something

1096
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,100
 or sleeping with something in the same way

1097
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,720
 that that mattress was like, man, it's damaged goods.

1098
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,960
 It's not worth anything to us.

1099
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,600
 That's how people will think about themselves.

1100
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,080
 That's how people will think about other people.

1101
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,200
 That's how people treat other people in their life.

1102
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,040
 It's not that big of a deal.

1103
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,560
 It's something to sleep with.

1104
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,000
 That is such an offense to God

1105
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,040
 who would come and die in your place

1106
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,440
 because the value you have is so great.

1107
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,280
 He would lay down his own life.

1108
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,320
 You're not damaged goods.

1109
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,800
 God is not done with you yet.

1110
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,240
 And he wants to uncomplicate your dating life

1111
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,400
 and lead you to experience more and more

1112
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,640
 of what he calls the abundant life

1113
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,720
 and walking in step with him,

1114
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,020
 the point of marriage and the point of life.

1115
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:51,080
 Turns out life is not that complicated.

1116
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,160
 It's to know him and then go make him known

1117
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,240
 to a world that needs it.

1118
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,080
 Let me pray.

1119
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,200
 Father, I pray for anyone in this room

1120
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,080
 who's carrying shame and guilt.

1121
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,600
 You would speak tenderly to the heart.

1122
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,960
 Whisper against lies.

1123
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,520
 Lies that say what defines them is their brokenness.

1124
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,200
 Lies like they're damaged goods.

1125
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,200
 Lies that they'll never and could never

1126
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,200
 have any type of healthy dating relationship

1127
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,100
 or healthy marriage or healthy future.

1128
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,760
 And I pray that you would lead us, God,

1129
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,420
 to whatever is the right next step

1130
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,640
 as we think about dating

1131
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,800
 or maybe there's a relationship

1132
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,120
 that we just, we know it's time to end it.

1133
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,320
 You'd help us.

1134
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,400
 I pray that you'd just unleash men and women in this room,

1135
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,200
 they would just honor one another.

1136
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,360
 They'd leave here in nothing else

1137
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,920
 but honor one another and honor God as they do so.

1138
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,640
 That that would happen.

1139
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,680
 So help us, God, to put the ways of childhood behind us

1140
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,480
 and follow our savior and live out mature love.

1141
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,360
 In your name and your glory, amen.
