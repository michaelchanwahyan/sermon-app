1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,820
 - All right, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,020
 We doing okay tonight?

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,020
 (congregation cheering)

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,100
 It's great to see you, man.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,260
 It's been an amazing start to the evening already.

7
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,980
 Worship was incredible.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,500
 I'm so excited that we're not done singing.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,940
 We're gonna sing some more,

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,000
 but we always love that in the middle of our time,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,480
 God gives us even more reason to sing

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,000
 as we listen to his word.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,740
 We're really grateful that you would be here

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,620
 as we move towards that time,

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,620
 not just those of you in the room,

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,500
 but there's so many of you tuning in online right now,

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,840
 and so we wanna give a special shout out

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,940
 to everyone that's streaming right now

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,700
 or maybe streaming in the future at some point,

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,580
 but particularly our Porch Live locations.

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
 We love what God is doing around the nation.

22
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,060
 Special shout out to Porch Live Boise, Midland, and Wheaton.

23
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,300
 Love it.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,300
 Hey, we're really particular about who we invite

25
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,000
 to guest speak here at the Porch

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,800
 because we hold the word of God in really high regard.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,560
 We believe that it really is from the mouth of God himself

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,100
 and it is speaking to us today,

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,700
 and so we're really intentional about trying to,

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,700
 trying to protect this platform

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,840
 and put before you people that you may know,

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,380
 you may not know, but you should be listening to

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,740
 because it's not they who speak,

34
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,840
 it's Christ that speaks through them,

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,300
 and tonight I'm grateful because we have a dear friend,

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,620
 the one and only Trip Lee here

37
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,340
 that has come to speak at the Porch.

38
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,380
 If you don't know who Trip is,

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,660
 Trip is, he's a rapper, former pastor, he's an artist,

40
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,000
 but he is just a man that has very clearly walked with Jesus.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,900
 You can tell it when you spend time with him.

42
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,740
 He looks like Jesus, he thinks like Jesus,

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,460
 he speaks like Jesus, and I think he preaches like Jesus.

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,460
 So would y'all do a great job of welcoming my friend,

45
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,780
 Trip, to the stage right now?

46
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
 (audience cheering)

47
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,220
 Thank you, man.

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,460
 Thank you, man.

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,020
 - How's everybody doing?

50
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,940
 (audience cheering)

51
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,340
 You know, sometimes before I come up,

52
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,180
 people will ask me how I want to be introduced,

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,100
 and I'm super low-key, you know,

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,860
 it's like whatever feels good,

55
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,740
 but I think from now on I will say

56
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,940
 please don't say I preach like Jesus because

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,860
 [audience laughing]

58
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,940
 not only is that a high bar, it's the highest bar possible,

59
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,640
 and so all I can do is disappoint you from this point.

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,620
 [audience laughing]

61
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,820
 I'm really grateful to be here.

62
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,360
 I love the Porch.

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,220
 I love when I get to be with y'all and worship with y'all,

64
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,300
 and I'm gonna pray before we get into God's Word and pray.

65
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,300
 That he will give us grace.

66
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,860
 Father, we come before you in Jesus' name.

67
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,740
 And we come before you in the name of Jesus, Father,

68
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,240
 because what you've told us in your Word

69
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,300
 is that there's no other name under heaven

70
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,020
 by which men can be saved.

71
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,420
 Father, you've told us it's through Jesus

72
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,840
 that we have access to you.

73
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
 Father, you've told us that it's through Jesus

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
 that we have access to forgiveness of sins

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,180
 and eternal life and joy at your right hand forevermore.

76
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,000
 We're so grateful for Jesus.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,340
 And it's in the name of Jesus we come before you now, Father,

78
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,620
 and we ask for your grace, Lord.

79
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,660
 We want this to be time well spent in your Word.

80
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,380
 We pray you would speak to us.

81
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,060
 As our brother just said, we want this to be a time

82
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,100
 where you grab ahold of your Word

83
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,140
 and put it in our hearts by your Spirit,

84
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,680
 and we pray you would do that.

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,100
 Father, we pray you give me grace

86
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,240
 to only say what you've already said.

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,220
 Father, and that people would leave impressed

88
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,220
 with your Son, Jesus.

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,580
 We ask in Jesus' name, amen.

90
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,420
 Amen.

91
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:10,540
 This first sentence that I'm gonna say

92
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,460
 is going to be the oldest sounding sentence

93
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,020
 that you'll probably ever hear me say.

94
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,660
 In fact, after I say this sentence,

95
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,940
 some of y'all might wanna just start calling me unk,

96
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,300
 even though I'm not an unk age yet.

97
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,900
 But I think we're giving computers

98
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,580
 too much power in our life.

99
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,620
 I think we have given computers

100
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,120
 way too much power in our lives.

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,900
 There were times where as new technology would come around,

102
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,120
 we would use different tools for different things.

103
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,880
 Now, for some reason, we've decided

104
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,660
 that the worst possible thing that could happen

105
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,740
 is a human doing anything.

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,620
 Sometimes I will see people

107
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,380
 with some new robot or AI they design,

108
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,160
 I'm like, bro, do you want a job?

109
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,620
 Why would you design your replacement?

110
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,220
 But everything, you know, even so as a musician,

111
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,020
 even within music, I mean, there's amazing things

112
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
 that have happened with music technology

113
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,440
 that allows people to do things they could never do before,

114
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,380
 but sometimes it gets to a point

115
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,740
 where if we make everything on a computer

116
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,380
 where no one actually plays any instruments

117
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,700
 by themselves at all,

118
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,140
 or somebody who loves electronic instruments,

119
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,560
 there is something that's missed with a human touch.

120
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,380
 Or when I talk to my friends who are dating,

121
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,700
 praise God, I'm at the game,

122
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,020
 but when I talk to my friends who are dating,

123
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,660
 and they talk about how difficult it is to meet people,

124
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,540
 and I ask them the ways they're meeting people,

125
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,020
 none of them have to do with looking

126
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,260
 at human beings in the eyeballs.

127
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,060
 All of it has to do with what we're doing

128
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,220
 on these little computers in our pockets.

129
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,580
 Don't call me ump just yet.

130
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,440
 There's some limitations that technology has,

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,860
 especially, you know, stuff like chat GPT,

132
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,540
 that sure, there's stuff that can help you.

133
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,740
 If your mom is texting you to ask how your week is going,

134
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,380
 maybe chat GPT don't need to write that text back.

135
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,660
 There are limits.

136
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,560
 Your mom knows what your sound's like.

137
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,360
 There's some kinds of human nuance that cannot be captured,

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,380
 so that even as technology is amazing,

139
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,180
 we understand, at least right now,

140
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,780
 there's some things that it's nice to have a human touch.

141
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
 It has limitations.

142
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,180
 It has some things it can't do as well.

143
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,940
 Everything that is helpful,

144
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,040
 that we are aware of, has its limitations.

145
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,100
 It has areas it's helpful,

146
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,100
 and areas where it's not as helpful.

147
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,980
 And it's a good thing for us to understand

148
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,540
 that everything has its limitations.

149
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,560
 Here's a problem.

150
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,660
 When we begin to take that perspective,

151
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,620
 that everything has its limitations,

152
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,780
 and we begin to apply it to the Lord Jesus,

153
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,900
 when we begin to think of Jesus

154
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,460
 as somebody who can be powerful and can be helpful,

155
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,780
 but he has his limitations,

156
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,020
 or when we think Jesus can be helpful in these areas,

157
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,820
 with these kinds of problems,

158
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,260
 or with this size of problems,

159
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,900
 but not with these things,

160
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,420
 then we have deeply misunderstood who Jesus is.

161
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,300
 We may think, well, I know God is able.

162
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,060
 I just don't know that I see a way

163
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,100
 that he can fix this situation at the moment.

164
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,700
 And so we're overcome with burden and anxiety.

165
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,260
 I can't count the number of times

166
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,220
 where I was very stressed out about something.

167
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,780
 I thought it was the end of the world,

168
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,780
 and then God fixed it, and I was like,

169
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,300
 whew, I should've knew Lord, and then I move on.

170
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,420
 Only for that thing to pop up again,

171
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,780
 something very similar, it's like I have no idea

172
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,140
 my life is about to end,

173
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,940
 and sure enough, the Lord spooks in once again,

174
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,220
 over and over again.

175
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,380
 Today, I want us to lean into that truth

176
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,180
 that Jesus is not limited.

177
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,140
 And with that in mind, here's the main thing

178
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,500
 I want you to walk away with,

179
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,740
 that the size of your problem

180
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,740
 does not change the source of your help.

181
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:55,780
 The size of your problem does not change

182
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,940
 the source of your help.

183
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,540
 And here's why that matters.

184
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,800
 Here's why I want us to grab ahold of that.

185
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,860
 Because I do not want us to think

186
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,880
 that Jesus is really helpful,

187
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,260
 but there are some things where we need

188
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,140
 to call on somebody else,

189
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,980
 or there's some areas where we just need

190
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,640
 to give in to despair.

191
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,100
 Brothers and sisters, there are some areas in your life

192
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,300
 that you have given over to despair,

193
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,220
 when in reality, the size of your problem

194
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,140
 does not change the source of your help.

195
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,460
 So I want to look at a part of the Gospels.

196
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,540
 If you have your Bible with you,

197
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,780
 you probably don't, you're probably letting

198
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,820
 the computer have your Bible, your phone.

199
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,620
 Either way, don't post this part of my sermon on the internet

200
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,020
 I don't need to seem un-kissed to anybody.

201
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,700
 Now open your Bibles, John chapter six.

202
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,920
 John chapter six.

203
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,420
 And we are going to look at a part of the Gospel of John

204
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,260
 that I think illustrates this for us.

205
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,060
 And we're gonna see three reasons why the size

206
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,580
 of your problem doesn't change the source of your help.

207
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,180
 Just go ahead and turn to John chapter six

208
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,900
 and we'll read it in a moment.

209
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,580
 All right, here's the first reason.

210
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,580
 Number one, is that he already has a plan.

211
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,260
 All right?

212
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,300
 No matter what size your problem is,

213
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,960
 number one, Jesus already has a plan.

214
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,280
 It is great when you have a big problem

215
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,560
 that you bring to somebody and you trust them

216
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,580
 to try to figure out how to fix it.

217
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,060
 Recently there was an issue with my wife's car.

218
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,780
 Now let me tell you, there are a lot of things

219
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,820
 that I'm great at.

220
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,480
 Fixing cars is not one of them.

221
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,940
 All right, there's some things I know how to fix.

222
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,360
 Usually relationships, not cars.

223
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,820
 So I can take it in and I can say,

224
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,760
 I don't know a lot about cars,

225
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
 but I know that ain't a sound that this is supposed to make.

226
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,680
 And so you know what they did?

227
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,320
 They sent me back a link after they looked at it

228
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,280
 that identified the problems

229
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,780
 and their recommendations for fixing it.

230
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,480
 Now of course, no matter what's wrong with your car,

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,980
 they're like, it's gonna cost you $49,000.

232
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,320
 I'm like, I didn't think windshield wiper fluid

233
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,280
 was that expensive.

234
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,080
 But it's nice when you bring a problem,

235
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
 it takes some of the stress away.

236
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,480
 You're no longer in it alone, right?

237
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,680
 When someone's willing to figure out what to do.

238
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,520
 But there's something even greater than that.

239
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,920
 The greatest response to bringing someone a complaint

240
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,600
 and a request is when they already know what to do

241
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,620
 before you even bring it.

242
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,880
 They don't have to figure it out.

243
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,160
 Y'all don't have to brainstorm together,

244
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,360
 but they already know what to do.

245
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,060
 You know, recently I got something from Uber Eats

246
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,500
 and Uber Eats is great when you're lazy, which is often.

247
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,180
 And also, I've never gotten an order that's right,

248
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,160
 not one time.

249
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,400
 And I keep going back like a sad little child.

250
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,260
 But they get it wrong every time

251
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,500
 and then they don't know how to help you.

252
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,620
 There's really nothing that they can do.

253
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,460
 Here's the opposite.

254
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,940
 There's this company that I buy music gear from.

255
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,660
 It's called Sweetwater, it's a free ad.

256
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,500
 Sweetwater.

257
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,300
 [audience laughing]

258
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,860
 Sweetwater.

259
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,380
 I bought, you know, when I buy something,

260
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,100
 I don't like to buy stuff I don't know I'm gonna keep

261
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,020
 'cause I am not good at sending stuff back.

262
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,140
 If it made it to my house, it's just here now.

263
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,600
 It's just part of my life.

264
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
 You know what they did?

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,220
 I said, hey, this actually wasn't the right one.

266
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,120
 They said, you know what?

267
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,740
 We've already emailed you return labels.

268
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,360
 Just bring it back, we'll take it back for free.

269
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,180
 I said, you have a customer for life.

270
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
 Because before I even brought the problem to them,

271
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,160
 they already had a solution.

272
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,820
 All I'm trying to say is this.

273
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,700
 When you bring a problem to somebody

274
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,500
 and they've already done something about it,

275
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,860
 that's even better than somebody

276
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,180
 who's willing to figure it out.

277
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,280
 And that is exactly what happens here with Jesus.

278
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,720
 We're gonna be familiar with this story

279
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,060
 in the Gospel of John, when Jesus feeds the 5,000.

280
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,020
 So John chapter six, starting at verse one,

281
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,220
 this is what God's word says.

282
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,180
 It says, after this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee,

283
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,340
 or Tiberias, a huge crowd was following him

284
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,560
 because they saw the signs that he was performing

285
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,180
 by healing the sick.

286
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,340
 Jesus went up a mountain and sat down there

287
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,940
 with his disciples.

288
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,340
 Now the Passover, a Jewish festival, was near.

289
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,880
 So when Jesus looked up and noticed a huge crowd

290
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,620
 coming toward him, he asked Philip,

291
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,640
 where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?

292
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,620
 He asked this to test him, for he himself knew

293
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,220
 what he was going to do.

294
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,940
 We'll stop right there.

295
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,440
 For a little bit of context,

296
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,900
 you know, it says, after this,

297
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,280
 Jesus had just been teaching after healing the sick.

298
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,640
 Jesus had been doing stuff that nobody had ever seen.

299
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,040
 They thought Jesus was just a regular dude from Galilee,

300
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,680
 and then he was at a wedding, and they was like,

301
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,140
 Jesus, where's the wine?

302
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,580
 He was like, hey, fill 'em up with water,

303
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,480
 and then all of a sudden, it was wine.

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,640
 They're like, I thought that was Jesus.

305
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,020
 How did he do that?

306
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,520
 Not only that, after that, there was somebody

307
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,000
 who was sick who he healed.

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,120
 He just told 'em, take up your mat and walk,

309
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,960
 and they were healed.

310
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,880
 And then right before this, you know what Jesus did?

311
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,480
 Somebody came and talked about their son who was sick.

312
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,840
 Jesus healed him remotely.

313
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,120
 Jesus was just like, he good.

314
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,680
 [audience laughs]

315
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,720
 And the dude was like, all right, I believe you.

316
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,840
 And he went back, and they were like, your son is good.

317
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,120
 He was like, when did he get good?

318
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,100
 It was like the exact time that Jesus remotely

319
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,780
 was like, he's good now.

320
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,780
 Jesus is doing things that nobody can imagine.

321
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,160
 So understandably, when Jesus crosses over the sea

322
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,400
 with his disciples, people are following him.

323
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,080
 When we see something incredible, something big,

324
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,060
 a spectacle, even if it's not good,

325
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,720
 we cannot take our eyes off it.

326
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,120
 Some of y'all be the people that I'm mad at in traffic

327
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,400
 that just wanna look at a wreck for no reason.

328
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,640
 Some of y'all hate follow people on social media.

329
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,960
 You hate everything they say, but you can't stop looking.

330
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,980
 We like a spectacle, whether good or bad.

331
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,560
 And with Jesus, he had been doing things

332
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,880
 nobody had ever seen before, and so there's a gigantic,

333
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,600
 mass of people that are following him around.

334
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,760
 To be clear, Jesus did not invite all of this crowd

335
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,920
 to follow him around.

336
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,720
 He did not announce a parade.

337
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,420
 They just wanted to be close to whatever

338
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,000
 this miraculous greatness was.

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,840
 And what we'll see in the Gospels is there's more

340
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
 than one way to follow Jesus.

341
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,160
 There are good and bad ways to follow Jesus.

342
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,520
 And we'll talk about that more, but I do wanna say

343
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,080
 that right now, even though Jesus is not a walking on Earth,

344
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,920
 there are still good and bad ways to follow Jesus

345
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,500
 that do not acknowledge who he is.

346
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,280
 There are ways of following Jesus only in name.

347
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,640
 There are ways of treating Jesus like a vending machine.

348
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,100
 There are ways of treating Jesus like a gumball dispenser,

349
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,200
 where you show up to church, you twist the knob,

350
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,680
 and you expect good blessings to fall out,

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
 and that is not the kind of follower that Jesus is after.

352
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,220
 And we'll even see in his text that some of these people

353
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,600
 who are following after Jesus are not the kind of follower

354
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,440
 that Jesus is after, so Jesus responds by going up

355
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,240
 to a mountain with his disciples,

356
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,140
 getting away from the crowd,

357
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,980
 to sit down and teach his disciples.

358
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,920
 One of the things this shows us is that Jesus

359
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,440
 is not like these influences we see,

360
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,440
 where his end goal is gathering people around himself

361
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,660
 for personal gain.

362
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,800
 Jesus' end goal is not crowds in and of themselves.

363
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,060
 Jesus wants to lead those crowds to a particular place.

364
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,960
 John also mentions that this is happening

365
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,640
 during the time of the Passover.

366
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,260
 I mention that because it's very interesting

367
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,720
 that during this time of the Passover,

368
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,840
 it's a time where they celebrate God sparing his people

369
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,400
 because of blood on the doorpost,

370
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,180
 and that the Passover is really pointing forward

371
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,500
 to this Jesus who would save his people

372
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,420
 by covering them in his blood.

373
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,880
 That this very special time in the calendar

374
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,800
 is even there to point to Jesus,

375
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,040
 and what it means is that the Jewish people

376
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,840
 are also filled with a kind of patriotic pride right now,

377
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,080
 and so when they see someone doing something amazing,

378
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,360
 they're thinking about it in a patriotic way.

379
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,080
 You'll see how that shows up.

380
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
 Look at verse five, it says,

381
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,560
 "So when Jesus looked up and noticed the huge crowd

382
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,280
 "coming toward him, he asked Philip,

383
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,320
 "where will we buy bread so that these people can eat?

384
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,820
 "He asked this to test him,

385
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,940
 "for he himself knew what he was going to do."

386
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,400
 Imagine just being with your friends

387
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,080
 and you look up and a gigantic mass of people are following.

388
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,400
 That is a scary sight.

389
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,120
 What we see from other accounts of this is,

390
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
 these people had been following Jesus

391
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,920
 not just for a few minutes but for hours.

392
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,480
 They had walked miles after Jesus,

393
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,880
 and Jesus sees them, and he cares about them.

394
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
 He doesn't just say, "Isn't that crazy,

395
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,200
 "these people are following me."

396
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,120
 No, no, no, he cares about them.

397
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,680
 He's not just worried about getting his likes up,

398
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
 he cares about the well-being of the people.

399
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,740
 Jesus loves people.

400
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,360
 And because Jesus loves people,

401
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,840
 that shapes how he interacts with them.

402
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,560
 You know, sometimes when we think

403
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,000
 about what Jesus asks of us,

404
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,560
 we think it's because Jesus wants us

405
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
 to just give, give, give to him.

406
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,280
 It's because we're not thinking about the way

407
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,240
 that Jesus is always acting towards us in love.

408
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,180
 This is just a random mob of people,

409
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,200
 Jesus is thinking of them in a loving way.

410
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,560
 We sometimes think that our main relationship to Jesus

411
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,200
 is he throws us instructions and we better follow him

412
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,440
 'cause he is Jesus after all.

413
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,320
 But in reality, everything that Jesus ever asks of us

414
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,640
 is in response to something that Jesus

415
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,220
 has already done for us.

416
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,960
 There is no circumstance where any human being

417
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,200
 would make the first move with God.

418
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,600
 Everything is a response to him.

419
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,160
 Me and my wife was talking to one of our single friends

420
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,840
 recently, and she was complaining how she wishes

421
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,640
 that she had a dude to be talking to,

422
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,040
 but the dudes just wanna be pursued.

423
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,720
 Then none of these dudes wanna make the first move,

424
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,560
 and that's another conversation for another sermon.

425
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
 If it's you, I see you.

426
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
 [audience laughing]

427
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,540
 But there are times in relationships where everybody's

428
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,800
 waiting for somebody else to make the first move

429
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,640
 and nobody wants to.

430
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,100
 This can even happen in marriage,

431
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,640
 when something happens and it's like,

432
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,360
 she better apologize first 'cause she was worse.

433
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,240
 I ain't gonna apologize first.

434
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,200
 Or you're in a conflict with somebody

435
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,860
 and you're waiting on them to text you back first.

436
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,600
 And that can happen in every relationship.

437
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,560
 I want you to know, God has never and will never

438
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,680
 wait for you to make the first move.

439
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,440
 God has always made the first move.

440
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,800
 And God knows your needs deeply,

441
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,680
 and he already has a plan to meet 'em.

442
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,080
 So not only is Jesus aware of the needs of the crowd

443
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,120
 that they need to eat, but he already knows

444
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,400
 what he's gonna do.

445
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,520
 So when he asks Philip, "Where will we buy bread?"

446
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,320
 I want you to imagine this, 'cause Jesus already knows

447
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,640
 he's about to do a miracle, and it's like he leans over

448
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,400
 to Philip like, "Hey, do you think Uber Eats

449
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,740
 "delivers this far out?"

450
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,760
 He already knows what he's doing.

451
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,560
 This is a teachable moment.

452
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,760
 This is a test.

453
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,100
 And what is the purpose of tests?

454
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,420
 The purpose of any test is to show you how far along

455
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,520
 the student is, right?

456
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
 To prove worth or skill level.

457
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
 To show what stage of development you're in.

458
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
 Right, and so Jesus is trying to see if Philip

459
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,000
 really understands his power.

460
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,040
 To see if Philip responds like he's talking

461
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,600
 to a regular human who's asking him to just do

462
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,960
 a bit of problem solving.

463
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,000
 And so Jesus is asking Philip, "Hey, what do you think

464
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,580
 "we can buy these people bread?"

465
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,600
 Not because Jesus wants to know where Philip is at,

466
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,320
 but because Jesus wants to show Philip where Philip is at.

467
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,520
 Usually when Jesus asks a question to his disciples,

468
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,080
 he's trying to show them where they are.

469
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,460
 Like when he says, "So who do men say that I am?"

470
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,600
 He wants to show them that they don't fully understand

471
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,520
 who he is yet.

472
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,320
 That's what tests are for.

473
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,240
 I remember one time when my first son was really young,

474
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,360
 I was like, when I was a little kid,

475
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,880
 my dad used to cut my hair.

476
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
 I'm gonna cut his hair.

477
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,160
 And do you know what that exercise showed me?

478
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,060
 That I should not be cutting his hair.

479
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,320
 He looked horrific.

480
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,680
 He looked so bad that I thought about just keeping it

481
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,360
 at home for several months so that nobody would ever

482
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,200
 know what I did.

483
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,360
 'Cause I was gonna have to take him to a barber

484
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,740
 and be like, take the hat off like, my bad.

485
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,000
 It showed me where I was at though.

486
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,320
 God still tests his people from time to time.

487
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,640
 There may be things that happen around us

488
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,680
 that show us where we are, right?

489
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,360
 And the goal is for us to grow.

490
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,740
 There may be something happening in your life right now

491
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,960
 where the problem in front of you seems insurmountable.

492
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,840
 You cannot imagine how you're gonna come out

493
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,880
 the other side of it.

494
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,800
 And God is using that to show you where you are.

495
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,120
 And when we fail a test, it's not so God can shame us

496
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
 or guilt us, it's not so you feel bad.

497
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,680
 It's God giving us an opportunity to grow.

498
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,160
 It is a blessing that God is so gracious

499
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,060
 that instead of just letting us stay at a place

500
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,540
 where we need to grow, God does things to show us

501
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,520
 where we are so that we see we need to grow.

502
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,000
 This is not God shaming us, this is God loving us

503
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,320
 so much that he's calling us forward.

504
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 Some of us, when we look at the things happening

505
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,280
 in our lives, we consider them a bunch

506
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,740
 of random circumstances.

507
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,760
 Sometimes Jesus is doing something on purpose

508
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,700
 to show you exactly where you are.

509
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,560
 And it's gracious of him to do it.

510
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,900
 It's out of his kindness.

511
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,800
 Verse six, it says, "He asked us to test him,

512
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,360
 "for he himself knew what he was going to do."

513
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,680
 Before the disciples even knew what the problem was,

514
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,400
 Jesus already knew what he was gonna do about the problem.

515
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,380
 There are so many times when we are caught off guard

516
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,200
 by situations, I want you to know,

517
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,220
 like Jesus in this text, God is never caught off guard.

518
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,200
 God has never been sucker punched by a circumstance.

519
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,040
 Right, 'cause this is how it works with people.

520
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,720
 By the time you get, by the time you get your problem

521
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 to somebody else's attention, they have to begin

522
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,240
 to brainstorm what to do.

523
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,160
 God already knows.

524
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,960
 When we bring things to God, he already knows.

525
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,360
 He already knows what to do about it.

526
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,280
 Isn't it a joy to know that you will never bring God

527
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,200
 a problem that he didn't already know about?

528
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,920
 I remember somebody saying, "Well, why do we pray?"

529
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,720
 It's not so that we can bring God up to speed.

530
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,960
 You will never be the first one to break news to God.

531
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
 He already knows.

532
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,120
 You know, sometimes when you're in a bad place

533
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,500
 and people wanna ask how they can help,

534
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,840
 but you don't even wanna go into it.

535
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
 You're not sure they'll understand.

536
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,660
 You never have to feel that way for God.

537
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,880
 He already knows.

538
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,720
 And he knows before you do.

539
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,440
 And it's because he loves you.

540
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,920
 You know that closeness you feel with a friend

541
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,320
 when you don't even have to always explain it all the way

542
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,920
 and they already understand you?

543
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,000
 I want you to do that times a million

544
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,520
 and that's how God understands you.

545
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,640
 He already knows your problem.

546
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,760
 And the disciples were beginning to learn

547
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,960
 the power that the son of God had.

548
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,280
 They were starting to follow.

549
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,800
 All right, so he already has a plan.

550
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
 That's number one.

551
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,560
 Right, the size of your problem doesn't change

552
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
 the source of your help.

553
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
 Here's the second reason.

554
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,200
 It's because he already has enough.

555
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,840
 He already has enough.

556
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,240
 Sometimes, some of us may dream about what we would do

557
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,220
 if suddenly we were just incredibly rich.

558
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,440
 Right, people be like, if I was a billionaire,

559
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,280
 you know what I would do?

560
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,320
 Well, first, I would buy this and this and this.

561
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,000
 And then, you know that one teacher who said

562
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,240
 she believed in me, buy a Maserati.

563
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,760
 [audience laughing]

564
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,080
 Right, we go through all this stuff.

565
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,240
 These things we'd like to do, these things we'd like to buy,

566
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,440
 these people we'd like to help.

567
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,920
 And we like to do this imaginary game

568
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,480
 because for most of us, we live in a reality

569
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,920
 where all of our desires can't be fulfilled.

570
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,320
 There are projects, there are dreams, there are desires

571
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,080
 that we do not have the resources to go after

572
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
 at the moment, right?

573
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,580
 I want you to know, this is an experience

574
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,760
 that is completely foreign to God.

575
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,560
 In order for God to wish he could do something,

576
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 if he had the resources, he would have to stop being God.

577
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
 Scripture says that the earth is the Lord's

578
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,240
 and all that's in it, everything belongs to God.

579
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,640
 He always has enough, always.

580
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,460
 And I bring this up because of how Philip replies

581
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,240
 when Jesus asks him about the bread.

582
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,000
 This is what Philip says when he says,

583
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,400
 where can we get bread, verse seven.

584
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,440
 Philip answered him, 200 denarii worth of bread

585
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,380
 wouldn't be enough for each of them to have a little.

586
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,600
 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother

587
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,000
 said to him, there's a boy here who has five barley loaves

588
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,240
 and two fish, but what are they for so many?

589
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,520
 And this might be a good time to make clear

590
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,240
 how big this crowd was.

591
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,640
 When we think of Jesus feeding the 5,000,

592
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,200
 we usually imagine that there were 5,000 people there total.

593
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,500
 When what the text says in verse 10 is that

594
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,020
 the men numbered about 5,000, right?

595
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,180
 At the time, crowds were counted by the heads

596
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,760
 of the household, but the crowd certainly

597
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
 would have included women and children.

598
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,640
 I mean, we know children were there 'cause he just says,

599
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,120
 there's a boy here, there are women and children.

600
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,760
 So that means this crowd was probably 20,000 or more.

601
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,200
 State Farm Arena, where the Atlanta Hawks play in Atlanta,

602
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,180
 holds 16,000 people, right?

603
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,040
 This means this is like a large arena concert-sized

604
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,000
 group of people walking after Jesus,

605
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
 which gives a little context for the way that Philip

606
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,700
 responds when he's like, hey, how can we buy them bread?

607
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,160
 Philip is looking at an arena of people like,

608
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,980
 I don't know if I can do that.

609
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,900
 He says 200 denarii wouldn't be enough.

610
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,680
 That's about half a year's wage, right?

611
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
 Philip is taking it at face value,

612
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,640
 the vastness of the crowd compared to how much

613
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,900
 it would cost, that's like half a year's wage.

614
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,180
 So he's saying, even if I took every dollar

615
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,300
 that I made for six and a half months,

616
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,940
 I still couldn't buy enough bread for everybody

617
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,620
 to get a few nibbles.

618
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,580
 Have you ever been to something where there wasn't

619
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,180
 enough food for everybody, like a party or something?

620
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,020
 And you're like, I know they said just get two wings

621
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,580
 a piece, but what are we doing?

622
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,020
 Super Bowl party, where you're like,

623
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,720
 I knew I shouldn't have trusted him to provide food.

624
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,600
 When has he ever shown himself to be responsible?

625
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,020
 Sometimes there's not enough for everybody.

626
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,900
 Philip responds as if the only way that everybody

627
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,740
 could be fed is if there's enough in front of us.

628
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,300
 And I'm sure after this happens,

629
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,820
 Philip's understanding of Jesus is changed.

630
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,060
 But you may say, but true, Philip responded

631
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
 very reasonably.

632
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,340
 What was he supposed to say when Jesus said,

633
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,420
 where are we gonna get bread?

634
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,180
 Was he supposed to just ignore what he sees

635
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,580
 in this sea of people?

636
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,820
 And here's what I'll say.

637
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,060
 God does not call his disciples to ignore

638
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,660
 the evidence of our eyes.

639
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,500
 He doesn't call us to pretend that there's not

640
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,740
 a big problem that needs to be solved.

641
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,380
 God calls us to see with more than just eyes.

642
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,660
 He doesn't call us not to see with our eyes,

643
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,300
 but with more to consider other factors

644
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,180
 such as who he is.

645
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,180
 So with whatever big thing is going on in your life,

646
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,580
 there is more to the story.

647
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,060
 Maybe your career plans are falling apart.

648
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,020
 I want you to know if Jesus is in the picture,

649
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,820
 there is more to the story.

650
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,180
 Maybe your mental health is falling apart.

651
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,520
 If Jesus is in the picture, there is more to the story.

652
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,900
 The problem is not that Philip could see with his eyes.

653
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,360
 The problem is Philip only saw with his eyes.

654
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,060
 We assume that God is bound by the natural world,

655
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,460
 by all the things we're bound by.

656
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,140
 God works in the supernatural.

657
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,500
 He is unlimited.

658
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,940
 Right, and then Andrew responds as well.

659
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,380
 Verse nine, there's a boy here who has five barley loaves

660
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,460
 and two fish, but what are they for so many?

661
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,300
 I mean, he's really like, I mean, I seen a kid

662
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,100
 with a sleeve of Ritz crackers,

663
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,700
 but what we gonna do with that?

664
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,740
 [audience laughs]

665
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,500
 That's basically what he said.

666
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,980
 'Cause that bread and the fish wouldn't have been

667
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,380
 enough to feed a family.

668
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,660
 Not an arena, and that's the problem.

669
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,540
 I was at a wedding recently, and there was only

670
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,980
 130 people there, but at the reception,

671
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,160
 it was taking too long for the food to be served,

672
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,980
 and I felt a mutiny boiling around me,

673
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
 where people were hungry.

674
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,100
 This is an impossible number of people to feed,

675
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,380
 but here's the thing, Jesus is not a millionaire

676
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,540
 who might run out of money.

677
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,180
 He's God with an indispensable amount of resources.

678
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,360
 If Jesus made everything, how could we think

679
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,060
 he couldn't gather enough food for people?

680
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,540
 Jesus has been feeding every living creature

681
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,940
 for all of human history.

682
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,100
 Of course he can feed a big crowd.

683
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:25,420
 When we limit what God can do with a big problem,

684
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,020
 we begin to seek power in other places.

685
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,660
 There's some believers who are caught up

686
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,700
 in political power at times, because they think

687
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,280
 that God's power, that God's ways are not enough

688
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,740
 to do things, and so they begin to seek power

689
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,200
 in other places, political power, maybe,

690
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,660
 authority in other ways.

691
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,860
 They think, well, let me do what I think God can.

692
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,140
 This is what it says in verse 10.

693
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,580
 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down."

694
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,900
 There's plenty of grass in that place,

695
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,540
 so they sat down, the men numbered about 5,000.

696
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,860
 Then Jesus took the loaves, after giving thanks,

697
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,380
 he distributed them to those who were seated,

698
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,620
 so also with the fish, as much as they wanted.

699
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,460
 When they were full, he told his disciples,

700
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,760
 "Collect the leftovers so that nothing is wasted."

701
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,440
 So they collected them and filled 12 baskets

702
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,660
 with the pieces from the five barley loaves

703
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,800
 that were left over by those who had eaten.

704
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,780
 He tells them to sit down in the grass,

705
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,660
 a bunch of 5,000 grown men trying to sit Indian style

706
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,220
 for the first time in 10 years.

707
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,300
 With kids running around, you know kids don't sit down

708
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,480
 when you tell them to, it takes several times.

709
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,060
 Jesus takes the loaves, thanks God for the food,

710
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,140
 he begins passing them out.

711
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,860
 I don't really know how the logistics works.

712
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,460
 I don't know if it's like when magicians keep

713
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,500
 just pulling more ribbon out of their mouth, I don't know.

714
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,140
 But somehow, as these very few fish and loaves

715
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,780
 is passed out, everybody gets them.

716
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,780
 They never run out, people go back for seconds,

717
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,380
 as much as they wanted, and the people were full.

718
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,500
 When you gotta feed a lot of people,

719
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,260
 everybody's usually not full, and there were leftovers.

720
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,980
 So it's not only that Jesus was able to provide enough,

721
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,460
 Jesus was able to provide more than enough

722
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,500
 to where they had even more than they started with.

723
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,040
 This is the power of Jesus, he already has enough.

724
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,700
 So with whatever big problem you have and you wonder,

725
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
 like no, no, Jesus has done ABC before,

726
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,300
 I'm not sure he can do this.

727
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,660
 Everything is in his hands.

728
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,380
 Everything belongs to God.

729
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,420
 Everything belongs to God.

730
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,580
 You think, I know, but this person,

731
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,700
 I can't change their mind, that person belongs to God.

732
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,380
 No, no, no, but I don't have no money in my bank,

733
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,220
 that money belongs to God.

734
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,180
 No, but you don't understand my discouragement,

735
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,880
 your heart, your soul, your mind belongs to God.

736
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,180
 Jesus already has enough.

737
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,540
 Ephesians 3:20, now to him who was able to do

738
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,060
 above and beyond all that we ask or think

739
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
 according to the power that works in us,

740
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,700
 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus

741
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,900
 to all generations forever and ever.

742
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,380
 Nothing limits Jesus, not even the needs we present to him,

743
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,060
 he can do far more.

744
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,160
 So when you pray to God, I want you to keep this in mind.

745
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,460
 When you think about your needs,

746
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,340
 I want you to keep this in mind.

747
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,060
 Because maybe this being about Jesus feeding people,

748
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,940
 maybe you're in a season where, you know,

749
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,260
 you're not struggling with having too little food

750
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,920
 or clothing or necessities.

751
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,100
 That's not what you don't have a lot of,

752
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,660
 but maybe, what about joy?

753
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,740
 What about strength?

754
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,660
 What about health?

755
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,340
 What about wisdom?

756
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
 What about opportunities?

757
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,420
 What about faith?

758
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,140
 I want you to know that Jesus

759
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,520
 has more than enough to pass out.

760
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,940
 You ever seen people who are the kids of like,

761
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,220
 super duper billionaires?

762
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,620
 Sometimes what'll happen is they'll go after their dreams

763
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,440
 and that would just be people in their comments

764
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,140
 all the time, it's like, why you doing that, you rich?

765
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,780
 Not allowing them to try anything,

766
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,800
 'cause they just know, no, no, no,

767
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,260
 you have a family member that has billions of dollars,

768
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,620
 you don't actually need to do all of this.

769
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,140
 They have unlimited money.

770
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,060
 Billionaires sometimes just be giving lots of money

771
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,980
 to different causes 'cause it doesn't hurt them.

772
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,700
 I want you to know, if there's a God who everything

773
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,180
 in all of the universe, everything that exists,

774
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,020
 belong to him, he can give as much as he wants

775
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,940
 and it doesn't hurt him.

776
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,380
 He's rich in grace, he's rich in mercy,

777
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,500
 he's rich in all resources.

778
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,340
 So the question is not, does he have enough?

779
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,860
 The question is, what's best for us?

780
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,380
 He already has a plan, he already has enough.

781
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,380
 Y'all still with me?

782
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,180
 The size of your problem doesn't change

783
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,420
 the source of your help.

784
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,120
 Last reason is this, he already has a kingdom.

785
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,460
 He already has a kingdom.

786
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,740
 Sometimes when crowds are quiet,

787
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,780
 I just look and see if I see pins moving.

788
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,940
 I see some pins moving.

789
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,300
 He already has a kingdom.

790
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,140
 Verse 14.

791
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,780
 Y'all was even quiet after I said that, verse 14.

792
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,460
 [audience laughing]

793
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,580
 When the people saw the sign he had done,

794
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,740
 they said, this truly is the prophet

795
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,740
 who was to come into the world.

796
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,420
 Therefore, when Jesus realized that they were about to come

797
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,420
 and take him by force to make him king,

798
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,100
 he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

799
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,340
 Remember earlier I said there are good and bad ways

800
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,100
 to follow Jesus and to respond to Jesus.

801
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,680
 I think the people responded interestingly.

802
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,220
 They were impressed by the sign that they had seen.

803
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,540
 And it was clear to them, this is not just a regular guy.

804
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,700
 Right?

805
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,620
 This is not just a spectacle, this is something incredible

806
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,180
 that must have come from God.

807
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,060
 When they say truly this is the prophet,

808
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,180
 they were probably thinking of Deuteronomy 18.

809
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,140
 Where it says the Lord your God will raise up for you

810
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,680
 a prophet like me from among your own brothers.

811
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,500
 You must listen to him.

812
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,820
 This is what you requested from the Lord your God

813
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,700
 at Horeb on the day of the assembly

814
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,160
 when you said let us not continue to hear the voice

815
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,800
 of the Lord our God or see this great fire any longer

816
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,020
 so that we will not die.

817
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,940
 Then the Lord said to me, they've spoken well,

818
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,060
 I will raise up for them a prophet like you

819
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,340
 from among their brothers.

820
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,860
 I'll put my words in his mouth and he will tell them

821
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,540
 everything I command.

822
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,020
 That's probably what they had in mind when they said

823
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,960
 this is the prophet from God.

824
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,420
 But what's interesting is it seemed like they started

825
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:24,700
 to merge the category of prophet with king.

826
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,500
 I told you it's Passover, they're feeling patriotic.

827
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,900
 They're feeling excited about their nation.

828
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,460
 And so they're expecting Jesus to be an earthly king

829
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,900
 and that's interesting 'cause that doesn't at all

830
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,460
 match up with what we see in Deuteronomy.

831
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,480
 They weren't demanding to hear more about the words of God,

832
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,600
 they were demanding the kind of things that you might want

833
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,580
 from an excellent politician.

834
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,420
 This shows where Israel like, you could be waiting

835
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,180
 for something, longing for something and still not even

836
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,380
 understand what you're waiting for when it's right

837
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,500
 in front of your face.

838
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,540
 They wanted to make Jesus king by force,

839
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,700
 which would only be possible.

840
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,060
 Now you think, how could they make Jesus king by force?

841
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,460
 Remember, this is a mob of 20,000 people.

842
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,740
 They're saying we're about to just snatch Jesus up

843
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,300
 and make him king and Jesus of course responds

844
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,300
 by withdrawing to the mountain because Jesus was not

845
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,820
 interested in earthly political power as his reign.

846
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,540
 He did not come for temporary national leadership,

847
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,100
 he came to redeem and to renew at a deeper level.

848
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,360
 Right, we are, you know, a little bit after there was

849
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,740
 a politician, election season isn't that far back,

850
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,060
 when politicians thirstily beg for us to love them

851
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,440
 and care for them so that they can get elected.

852
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,940
 But I want you to know what Jesus is doing

853
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,740
 is the opposite of political rallies.

854
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,420
 Jesus gathers us to serve us.

855
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,220
 Not that there are no politicians who have good motives

856
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,580
 but there is not an ounce of self-serving in the way

857
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,980
 that Jesus leads, there's no pandering,

858
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,340
 there's no compromising the truth for the sake of popularity

859
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,940
 there's no worrying about, if I should say true things

860
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,660
 because of how it will affect.

861
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,620
 There's no ruthless self-serving, this is Jesus.

862
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,220
 Not saying just what people want to hear

863
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,620
 but gathering us in order to serve us.

864
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,980
 What's really clear is they misunderstood the kind of reign

865
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,380
 that Jesus came to bring.

866
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,980
 They said let us give you this earthly kingdom.

867
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,900
 John 6, 26, Jesus said, truly I tell you,

868
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,500
 you're looking for me, not because you saw the signs

869
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,520
 but because you ate the loaves and were filled.

870
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,420
 Don't work for the food that perishes

871
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,580
 but for the food that lasts for eternal life

872
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,360
 which the Son of Man will give you

873
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,720
 because God the Father has set his seal of approval on.

874
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,000
 John 6, 35, Jesus says, I'm the bread of life.

875
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,020
 No one who comes to me will ever be hungry,

876
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,900
 no one who believes in me will ever be thirsty again.

877
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,660
 But as I told you, you've seen me

878
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,100
 and yet you do not believe.

879
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,580
 Y'all, they wanted Jesus to be king

880
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,280
 instead of king of kings.

881
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,380
 They didn't want Jesus to rule as the eternal king

882
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,120
 of the universe, they wanted him to be

883
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,360
 a lowercase king of Israel.

884
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,980
 This is like Jesus saying I've come to save your souls,

885
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,940
 to bring new heaven and the new earth,

886
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,980
 to do away with all sin and pain.

887
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,900
 And we're like, no, no, no, Jesus,

888
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,300
 we want you to be president.

889
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,020
 We want you to try to work out a deal with Congress.

890
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,620
 They're disappointed that Jesus wouldn't be

891
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,540
 a lowercase king because they do not understand

892
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,680
 the glory of being under the reign of the king of kings.

893
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,240
 When we are disappointed with Jesus,

894
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,220
 it's because our sights are set too low.

895
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,820
 When we are disappointed that Jesus hasn't given us

896
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,720
 all these little earthly things we want,

897
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,740
 it's because we're missing the fact that Jesus

898
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,980
 is after more than just those earthly things,

899
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,420
 not less, more.

900
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,720
 When Jesus says no to something we ask him for,

901
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,660
 it's not because he doesn't want to give us great things,

902
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,900
 it's because he's given us something better instead.

903
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,540
 And that he knows what's best for us.

904
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,340
 So Jesus is saying, look,

905
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,500
 I'm not here just to fill your stomachs.

906
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,440
 They wanted Jesus to be a bakery, right?

907
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,900
 Jesus says, I'm the bread of life.

908
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,700
 This isn't the bread that comes down from heaven

909
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,900
 so that anyone may eat it and not die.

910
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,500
 He says, I'm the living bread that came down from heaven.

911
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,180
 If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.

912
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,920
 The bread that I will give for the life of the world.

913
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,380
 Jesus is saying, your ancestors had manna from heaven

914
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,340
 and they died.

915
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,260
 He says, I have something even better for you.

916
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,380
 The bread of life that you will have eternal life.

917
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,600
 Jesus did not come to make us sandwiches.

918
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,140
 Jesus came to make us whole.

919
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,300
 Imagine being disappointed that instead of just feeding us

920
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,140
 for a moment, Jesus says, I will feed your soul

921
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,260
 for an eternity.

922
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,620
 Here's one of my favorite things about Jesus

923
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,820
 and the gospels is that Jesus doesn't just point us

924
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,920
 to good things.

925
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,840
 Jesus says, I am the good thing.

926
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,540
 Jesus doesn't just say, I can point you

927
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,380
 to the bread of life.

928
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,940
 Jesus says, I am the bread of life.

929
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,620
 Eat of me, you'll never hunger again.

930
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,780
 Jesus doesn't say, I can point you to living water.

931
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,820
 Jesus says, I am the living water.

932
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,140
 Drink of me, you'll never thirst again.

933
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,140
 Jesus doesn't say, I can point you to the way.

934
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,620
 Jesus says, I am the way.

935
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,260
 Jesus doesn't say, I can tell you the truth.

936
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,900
 He says, I am the truth.

937
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,820
 Jesus doesn't just say, I can point you to life.

938
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,740
 He says, I am the life.

939
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,620
 And the entire point of everything that Jesus does

940
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,900
 is not just to feed our bellies, but to feed our souls.

941
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,020
 If the way you follow and look to Jesus

942
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,420
 is one where you're disappointed when you don't get

943
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,380
 every little thing you want,

944
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,900
 it's because you're overlooking the way that Jesus

945
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,980
 has already met your greatest need.

946
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,460
 There's some times we're disappointed

947
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,900
 because of the temporary ways that Jesus

948
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,980
 hasn't done exactly what we've asked of him.

949
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,500
 And Jesus is saying, I'm actually interested

950
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,460
 in more than that.

951
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,940
 And it's out of love and kindness.

952
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,220
 So that someone may say, okay, I know that there was

953
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,700
 this man who was a great teacher who walked the earth

954
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,740
 and we have great things to learn from him

955
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,980
 and he can solve my problems with having bad perspectives.

956
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,500
 I want you to know, you're thinking

957
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,940
 too small of Jesus.

958
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,060
 And there's a much bigger problem that we have.

959
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,940
 Sin, death.

960
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,460
 Right, well people will say nothing is certain

961
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,380
 except death and taxes.

962
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,900
 You will die.

963
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,300
 Your life will end.

964
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,540
 There's no amount of medicine or food

965
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,180
 that can keep your life from ending

966
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,660
 except there's a savior who says, I've conquered death.

967
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,820
 And you know, sometimes when people make such big claims

968
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,140
 like they can hold death back,

969
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,380
 it's like, well what are you talking about?

970
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,020
 How can you show me?

971
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,300
 Look, one of the most beautiful things about Jesus

972
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,460
 is he never said anything that he didn't back up

973
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,240
 in a way even greater than we would have imagined.

974
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,660
 Jesus could have just said, well no,

975
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,420
 look at the way I raised Lazarus.

976
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,740
 Look at the way I raised Talitha.

977
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,100
 I'm just talking to people, they're getting out of the grave.

978
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,140
 Jesus said, I'm gonna go in the grave myself

979
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,740
 to pay for your sins.

980
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,180
 Scripture says that the wages of sin is death.

981
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,400
 Jesus said, I already paid those wages.

982
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,140
 [audience applauding]

983
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:37,100
 And the beautiful thing about these unimaginable miracles

984
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,500
 is if you're tempted for a moment to doubt,

985
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,700
 this man Jesus who says that he can save my soul,

986
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,300
 what proof do I have?

987
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,980
 Because that sounds impossible.

988
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,580
 That sounds too big.

989
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,020
 That he can wipe away my sins,

990
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,540
 give me a perfect record that I can live forever

991
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,560
 with a glorified body, eternal joy forever.

992
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,140
 Jesus does these incredible miracles throughout the Gospels

993
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,180
 to remind us there's much more than meets the eye.

994
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,020
 As soon as you think there's a problem too big,

995
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,580
 I've solved it over and over and over again.

996
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,460
 So for those problems in your soul,

997
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,700
 there is a Savior who says, I want you to come to me,

998
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,980
 not just to feed you for a moment, but for eternity.

999
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:31,620
 And he calls you, he welcomes you, he loves you,

1000
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,460
 he forgives you by faith.

1001
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,020
 Jesus says, trust me and I will feed your soul forever.

1002
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:45,540
 The size of your problem doesn't change

1003
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,820
 the source of your help because there is a Savior

1004
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,380
 who's not limited in his name, it's Jesus.

1005
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,520
 Amen, amen, let me pray.

1006
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,060
 Father, we come before you in the name of Jesus.

1007
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,620
 Aware of the fact that there's not enough time

1008
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,740
 or enough words or enough illustrations or enough stories

1009
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,780
 that could ever get close to pointing

1010
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,460
 to your majesty and power.

1011
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,460
 God, the sheer scale of your power that you showed

1012
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,900
 means that everything we do is a weak attempt.

1013
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,660
 But Father, what we know is that your word is true

1014
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,460
 and that your spirit uses your word.

1015
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,260
 Father, we pray you would impress on our hearts and souls

1016
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,540
 the glory of Jesus, not just as a great teacher

1017
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,460
 and a miracle worker, but as a Savior.

1018
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,820
 Thank you for Jesus.

1019
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,500
 Father, I pray our souls will feast on Jesus.

1020
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,600
 God, there was celebration at the passover.

1021
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,800
 There was a feast to celebrate what you had done.

1022
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,540
 God, thank you for a Savior who says,

1023
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,220
 feast on me for an eternity.

1024
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,460
 God, give us grace to be satisfied in him.

1025
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,220
 God, I pray for my brothers and sisters in this room

1026
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,260
 who see things in their life that seem bigger than Jesus.

1027
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,140
 I pray you would show them that giants are tiny

1028
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,340
 when they stand before the Savior, Jesus.

1029
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,620
 Father, and for my friends in this room

1030
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,780
 who do not know Jesus, God, I pray you would help them

1031
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,980
 to see how powerful, how gracious, how loving,

1032
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,280
 how kind the Savior is.

1033
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,380
 They would trust in his death and resurrection.

1034
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,620
 Father, and that they would have friends

1035
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,420
 to walk alongside them in it.

1036
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,660
 We ask this in the name of your son, Jesus.

1037
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,500
 Amen.

1038
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,260
 (water bubbling)
