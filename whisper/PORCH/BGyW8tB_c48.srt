1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,820
 - You have seven unheard messages.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,500
 - Hey, sorry I haven't texted.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,540
 I'm just not really sure what I'm feeling right now.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,020
 - Hey, yo Danny!

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,700
 Where you at, bro?

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,540
 I'll see you soon, all right?

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,660
 - Hey, so I have moved on,

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,020
 but I feel like the Lord keeps putting me back

10
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,260
 on my heart for a reason.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,940
 So please call me back.

12
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,300
 - Hey, bro, hey, I know you're going through it right now,

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,180
 but listen, I found another girl at the farmer's market.

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,100
 Now, she's not a farmer, but she is on the market, okay?

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,540
 So hit me back, love you, bro.

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,300
 - No, I'm sure this is the right number,

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,220
 but last night was a mistake.

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,140
 I was just hoping we could keep that between us.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,340
 - Hey, just wanted to say,

20
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,140
 I don't think I can make it tonight.

21
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,420
 Yeah, I've just been thinking about us a lot lately,

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,880
 and we need to talk.

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,500
 - All right, all right, Porch, how we doing tonight?

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,620
 Great to see you.

25
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,020
 If it's your first time, welcome in the room.

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,420
 We're really glad you're here.

27
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,820
 If you've been here before, welcome back.

28
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,140
 We never want to forget about you,

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,120
 and then we never want to forget about everybody

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,820
 that is tuning in online.

31
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,880
 Well, y'all do a great job of helping me say hello

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,780
 to everybody that is tuning in with us here tonight.

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,960
 Amazing.

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,700
 Special shout out to all of our Porch Live locations,

35
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,700
 particularly Porch Live Springfield,

36
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,180
 Porch Live Midland, and Porch Live Boise.

37
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,260
 Got some Midland homies in the front.

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,740
 Well, when I was in college,

39
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,100
 I was convinced that I wanted to be an accounting major,

40
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,740
 not because I loved a really good balance sheet,

41
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,580
 but because it's what everybody was doing.

42
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,500
 You see, in the school that I went to,

43
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,580
 we had a program where over the course of five years,

44
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,100
 you could pick up not only your bachelor's degree,

45
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,340
 but also your master's degree,

46
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,080
 which in my mind's eye seemed like a really great play

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,540
 to run because for me,

48
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,980
 it meant that I get to add a few more letters to my resume,

49
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,620
 and I also get to spend another year with the boys.

50
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,140
 And so I decided, you know what,

51
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,060
 this is what I'm going to do.

52
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,180
 I don't necessarily need to consider anything else.

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,780
 So I didn't think about what are my natural aptitudes?

54
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,560
 I didn't process, well, what are my career ambitions?

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,900
 Or what's the coursework actually look like?

56
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
 What are the degree tracks are there?

57
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,660
 I just blindly signed up and began to pursue the curriculum

58
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,480
 that was set for me.

59
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,340
 And so I went through my freshman year.

60
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,820
 I went through my sophomore year.

61
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,500
 I got through my junior year,

62
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,520
 and then the imperceivable happened.

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,320
 I didn't get into the program,

64
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,020
 which was devastating to me

65
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,200
 because I had been planning on this.

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
 Like I had been hoping with all of my future in mind

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,560
 that this is what I was going to get to do.

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
 And yet in a moment,

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,880
 all of my hopes and my dreams and my ambitions

70
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,320
 were dashed on the rocks of assets, equal liabilities,

71
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,720
 plus stockholders equity.

72
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,320
 You know, I'd been counting on this, no pun intended.

73
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,260
 And yet in a moment,

74
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,520
 it felt like all of my peers were racing forward.

75
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,720
 And yet instead for me, I was stuck behind.

76
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,760
 And so facing what felt like an existential crisis

77
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,040
 that was way too early in my young life,

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,720
 I went and I met with a school counselor.

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,000
 And as I sat with him,

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 he said something that has stuck with me ever since.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,300
 He said, "Kylin, don't worry.

82
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,600
 The conversation we're having, everybody's having.

83
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,140
 We're just having this conversation out loud.

84
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,460
 And then he proceeded to help me consider

85
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,460
 the things that I hadn't considered.

86
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,620
 He helped me to realize,

87
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,420
 "Hey man, you kind of suck at math.

88
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,680
 You know, you don't really love accounting

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,220
 and you have no business as a result

90
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,400
 ever balancing anybody's books.

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,100
 And why do I tell you that?

92
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,100
 Because tonight I want to have a conversation with you

93
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,480
 out loud that everybody, many young adults

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,020
 across the nation and many in this room as well

95
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,980
 are processing, but they're processing in silence.

96
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,940
 I want to talk to you about a question

97
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,420
 that many people ask themselves

98
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,660
 within their young adult years.

99
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,100
 I want to process with you, why am I still single?

100
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,420
 I want to help you, not me, some of you.

101
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,740
 And so I want to help you really consider

102
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,120
 what is it then that has put me in this situation?

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,060
 Like you're facing what I felt in a similar way,

104
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,500
 but probably so much greater.

105
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,540
 You're dealing with an existential crisis.

106
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,660
 You look at your life and you're like,

107
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,340
 "This isn't what I planned.

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,980
 I'm not supposed to still be here.

109
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,540
 Everyone else is racing forward

110
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,020
 and yet I am stuck someplace I never thought I would be.

111
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,380
 I don't understand why you're complicating my life.

112
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,300
 I'm a good person.

113
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,320
 That's a good thing to want.

114
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
 Why can't I have it?"

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,320
 So what I want to do is I want to help you understand

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,320
 a few practicals for why this may be a season

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,800
 in your life that you,

118
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,880
 why this may be a season you're stuck in

119
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,360
 that you don't want to be a part of.

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,160
 And yet before we talk about the practicals,

121
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,600
 what we need to do is we need to talk about

122
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 the fundamentals.

123
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
 You need to understand that namely,

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,320
 that singleness is not a second rate state of being.

125
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,680
 It's not a second rate state of being.

126
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,600
 Several weeks ago, we actually preached here at Watermark.

127
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,160
 I preached here at Watermark through this idea

128
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,280
 of why singleness is worth embracing.

129
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
 I'd encourage you to go listen to it

130
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,440
 'cause it's going to help unpack

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,620
 the fundamental goodness of singleness.

132
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,400
 But just to catch you up really briefly,

133
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,800
 what you need to know is that in our culture,

134
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,040
 both within our church and in our world,

135
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,480
 we have a tendency to look at singleness

136
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,200
 and think it is inferior in comparison to marriage.

137
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,360
 That it's JV in comparison to the marriage varsity.

138
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,940
 That it's a second class sort of state.

139
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,120
 That it's the sort of situation

140
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
 where all the marriages are flying first class

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,920
 while all the singles are sitting in coach.

142
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
 But that's not what we understand from the scripture.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,540
 What Paul actually unpacks for us

144
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,560
 in 1 Corinthians chapter seven,

145
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
 which is where we're going to be

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
 over the course of the evening,

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
 as well as a variety of different passages.

148
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,360
 So mostly, track with the screen.

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,000
 He says this, 1 Corinthians 7, six through nine.

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,320
 "Now as a concession and not a command, I say this.

151
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,520
 "I wish that all were as I myself am.

152
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,460
 "But each has his own gift from God,

153
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,460
 "one of one kind, one of another,

154
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,520
 "to the unmarried and the widows,

155
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,420
 "I say, hey, it's good for them to remain single as I am.

156
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,580
 "But if they cannot exercise self-control,

157
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,100
 "they should marry, for it is better to marry

158
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,840
 "than to burn with passion."

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,500
 Some of you only heard that last line

160
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,600
 because you squarely identify yourself

161
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,440
 within the burning for passion category.

162
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,520
 That's me, man, that's how I feel right now.

163
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,140
 I don't need anything else that you're going to say tonight.

164
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,680
 Well, before you write me off or you tune me out,

165
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,140
 just track with me because here's the reality.

166
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,900
 So many people were single at one time.

167
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,980
 So many people are single in this moment,

168
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,420
 but the truth is everybody will be single again

169
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,820
 at some point in the future.

170
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,980
 And so it's helpful for us to understand

171
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,940
 what are the reasons for it?

172
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,140
 What's the purpose behind it?

173
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,420
 And what we see is that Paul gives us two reasons

174
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,860
 for why God ordains the goodness of singleness.

175
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,060
 The first thing is he tells us,

176
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,100
 hey, singleness is desirable.

177
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,940
 He says, "I wish that all," meaning all,

178
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,860
 "were as I myself am."

179
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,540
 Well, Paul, how are you?

180
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,640
 He's talking about his singleness in this moment.

181
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,140
 Paul was a single, celibate, childless man.

182
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,100
 And he's saying, "I wish that all people were like me."

183
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,420
 You can go read back through more of 1 Corinthians 7,

184
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,540
 you can see why that is,

185
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,500
 but particularly it's because he could consume himself

186
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,900
 with the things of God.

187
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,980
 He could focus himself fully

188
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,220
 on that which mattered most in life,

189
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,820
 which is important for us to know

190
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,140
 because as Paul says this,

191
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,820
 hey, this is worthy of desiring,

192
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,940
 it is in stark contrast to so much of what our world,

193
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,300
 culture, and even the church would say.

194
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
 Because if you look out there,

195
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,420
 what you realize is often people are saying,

196
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,100
 hey, in order to live a fulfilling human experience,

197
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,060
 you need to be married, have sex,

198
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,140
 and probably should have a couple of kiddos.

199
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,740
 But Paul's saying you don't need those things.

200
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,060
 And to actually emphasize the point further,

201
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,060
 Paul, yes, was single, but so was Jesus.

202
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,140
 If you're in the room and you say,

203
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,740
 I'm a Christian, I follow that man named Christ,

204
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,780
 then what you need to understand

205
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,860
 is you follow a single man,

206
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,860
 a man that was fully single, and yet he was fully human,

207
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,460
 meaning he didn't need to be married,

208
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,340
 he didn't need to have sex,

209
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,500
 he didn't need to have biological children

210
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,700
 to have the fulfilling experience

211
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,460
 that the rest of the world is saying you must have.

212
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,900
 Singleness is desirable.

213
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,980
 He also goes on and he says, secondly, it's purposeful.

214
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
 Singleness is purposeful.

215
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,180
 That's what he means when he says it's a gift,

216
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,180
 which I know for many of you

217
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,020
 didn't necessarily make your wishlist.

218
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,100
 You kind of opened this thing up

219
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,500
 and you were like, thank you, God?

220
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 You know, like it's not necessarily

221
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,980
 the gift you were hoping to get,

222
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,220
 but before you look for the receipt,

223
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,260
 let me just help you understand why it's a good thing.

224
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,940
 He tells us later on in verse 35,

225
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,580
 I say this, talking about singleness,

226
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,020
 for your own benefit, for your good,

227
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,140
 not to lay a restraint upon you,

228
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,740
 but to promote good order,

229
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,900
 meaning, hey, I want you to learn how to live

230
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,660
 and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.

231
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,380
 I want you to love God before you love anybody else.

232
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,820
 You see, Paul says this thing is good.

233
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,580
 It's a gift.

234
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,260
 So why do we need to know all this?

235
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,140
 Because fundamentally,

236
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,700
 before we even step into the rest of the talk,

237
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,320
 at the outset, we have to grasp a new perspective.

238
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,980
 We have to reframe our attitude around this subject,

239
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,020
 which so many of us are ready to punt on and push aside.

240
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,020
 We have to understand singleness is not a season to endure.

241
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,740
 It is a season to embrace.

242
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,600
 That's what Paul is describing.

243
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,180
 That's what the word of God is telling us here.

244
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,300
 He's saying it's good.

245
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,680
 And the reason we have to know this at the outset,

246
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,700
 before we talk about anything else, don't worry,

247
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,580
 I'm going to help you see some reasons

248
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,660
 for why you may still be single

249
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,580
 if you don't want to be.

250
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,060
 But what you have to understand

251
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,060
 is that this takes all of the anxiety out of the assessment.

252
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,260
 And as we look at a variety of reasons,

253
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,900
 it helps you to realize,

254
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,920
 I'm not stuck in some inferior state of being.

255
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,420
 No, I'm in a state that God would say is good.

256
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,040
 It's kind of like if you walked into a performance review,

257
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,280
 but you'd already received the company MVP award.

258
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,660
 How would you feel?

259
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,440
 You would walk in and you'd be like, man, okay,

260
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,160
 like I'm excited to learn some things.

261
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,760
 Sure, I'm gonna get some helpful feedback.

262
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,960
 I'm probably gonna grow a little bit,

263
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,720
 but I'm not stressed about this.

264
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
 I'm not worried.

265
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,380
 In fact, I'm wanting to learn

266
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,440
 because I already have something.

267
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,420
 I've received something that signifies favor.

268
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,720
 That's what Paul wants you to know.

269
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,520
 You have something that is good,

270
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,540
 but let me be very clear.

271
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,680
 As I say that,

272
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,320
 some of you think, man, this thing doesn't feel good.

273
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,800
 Like if someone tells me that singleness is a gift,

274
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,640
 one more time,

275
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,000
 I understand that that can feel like a trite Christian

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,380
 cliche.

277
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,760
 It's from the Bible.

278
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,600
 So let's not jettison it

279
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,380
 with the rest of our hard feelings towards this subject.

280
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,140
 Let's try to understand why is it good?

281
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,140
 You see, as we get into this,

282
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,360
 you need to know, yes, singleness is good,

283
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,120
 but that doesn't diminish the fact that it's also hard.

284
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,900
 It's hard.

285
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,420
 I don't want you to hear me say, as we go through this,

286
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,300
 that you should feel a diminishing of your longing

287
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,580
 for marriage, that this belittles the heartache you feel

288
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,860
 or the hurt you have,

289
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,780
 that in no way does this look at the sadness

290
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,420
 you face in your singleness and make it synonymous to sin.

291
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,100
 That's not what we're talking about here.

292
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,800
 But what we do have to understand

293
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,520
 is that God has no problem asking people to wait.

294
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,980
 All throughout the scripture,

295
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,420
 he never has an issue looking at his people and saying,

296
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,900
 hey, I know you have a longing,

297
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,300
 but I want you to wait for its fulfillment.

298
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,520
 You see, admittedly,

299
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,100
 the Bible doesn't particularly say a lot

300
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,400
 with respect to the question, why am I still single?

301
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,900
 But it does have a lot to say

302
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,740
 about why we wait for what we want.

303
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,420
 You see, in the beginning of the scripture,

304
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,220
 a man by the name of Abraham,

305
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,900
 who waited 25 years for that which he wanted,

306
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,860
 the son of promise, his son, Isaac.

307
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,620
 You move over from that and you get to Joseph,

308
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,540
 and Joseph, he waited 13 years to be freed from prison.

309
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
 You move from there,

310
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,980
 Moses waited 40 years in the wilderness

311
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,380
 before going to the promised land.

312
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,740
 David, right after then,

313
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,780
 he waited about 15 years from being anointed to become king

314
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,080
 before he finally actually took the throne.

315
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,720
 And Jesus, he waited 30 years

316
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,220
 before he began his public ministry.

317
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,060
 To top that off,

318
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,660
 the guy who is even writing to us understands this well

319
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,300
 because Paul waited 14 years

320
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,920
 before he began his first missionary journey,

321
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,120
 despite being commissioned so early on.

322
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,960
 You see, God has no problem asking us

323
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,020
 to wait for what we want.

324
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:24,880
 But it begs the question, why does he make us wait?

325
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,080
 What reasons does he have to give?

326
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,740
 For those of you that are wanting for more than singleness,

327
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,780
 what possible explanation does he have?

328
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,160
 Well, the first thing that he would say,

329
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,800
 the first reason he might give is you're not ready.

330
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,580
 You're not ready.

331
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,000
 Which some of you hear that and you think,

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,480
 "No, man, I'm pretty ready.

333
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,600
 "Have you seen my Pinterest board?

334
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,760
 "That thing was done years ago.

335
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,080
 "Colors for my wedding, they're picked out.

336
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,780
 "Me and the boys, we've already planned the bachelor party

337
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,800
 "and none of us are even in a relationship.

338
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,040
 "I'm pretty sure we're ready for this."

339
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,680
 I'm not belittling that that's true.

340
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,200
 And yet what you have to understand

341
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,800
 is that you're not alone in the sentiment.

342
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,640
 When you read through the scripture,

343
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,320
 you find the people of God felt the exact same way.

344
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,880
 You see, the nation of Israel,

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,640
 after they're delivered out of Egypt from slavery,

346
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,480
 they have their eyes set on that which was promised to them

347
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,120
 from their ancestral heritage.

348
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,160
 They're looking towards the promised land.

349
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,240
 And so as they stepped out of Egypt,

350
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,200
 they're waiting to go to that place

351
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,960
 which they have longed to be.

352
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,760
 And yet what we read in Exodus 13

353
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
 is God doesn't just take them immediately there.

354
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,320
 He says in Exodus 13, verse 17,

355
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,120
 "When Pharaoh let the people go,

356
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,000
 "God did not lead them on the road

357
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,280
 "to the Philistine country, though that was shorter.

358
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,200
 "For God said, if they face war,

359
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,080
 "they might change their minds and return to Egypt.

360
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,400
 "So God led the people around by the desert

361
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,520
 "toward the Red Sea."

362
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,280
 You see, rather than lead the Israelites to that place

363
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,300
 which they longed to be in the direction of north,

364
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,480
 which would have been fastest,

365
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 God leads them south in the direction that was furthest.

366
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,520
 What?

367
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,920
 Why would God do that?

368
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,080
 That feels crazy.

369
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,920
 And some of you agree.

370
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,040
 You're like, that's exactly how I feel.

371
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,440
 I feel like I've been trying to get this direction

372
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,760
 and God just keeps moving me on a different path.

373
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,480
 What you have to understand is God is looking at the road

374
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,520
 they would have to take.

375
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,280
 And he's saying, you guys are not ready for this thing.

376
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,960
 Like the road that leads north,

377
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,520
 the quickest route to your happiness,

378
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,280
 where it takes you is through Philistine country.

379
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,640
 The Philistines, they were a militarized group of people.

380
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
 And the road itself was called the Viamaris.

381
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,640
 It was a fortified roadway that was set up for ambush.

382
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,000
 And so God is saying, hey, if you take this road,

383
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
 you're walking into a buzzsaw.

384
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,360
 Like you are not ready for this.

385
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,600
 You have been abused and beaten and enslaved for 400 years.

386
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,240
 You're doing well just to keep your sandals on your feet.

387
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,400
 You're not ready to face these guys.

388
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,080
 And so what he does is he takes them south.

389
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,960
 It's in his kindness, he takes them a different direction.

390
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,740
 Do you think they grumbled along the way?

391
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,000
 We know they did.

392
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
 They grumbled against him the entire time.

393
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,440
 And yet in God's kindness,

394
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,520
 he led them a different direction for their good.

395
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,240
 You see, the fastest route to your happiness

396
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,000
 is not always the wisest route.

397
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,840
 The fastest route to your happiness

398
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,560
 isn't always the wisest route.

399
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,280
 And yet so many people, they rush into marriage

400
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,480
 because they wanna feel loved and they wanna have sex

401
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,720
 and they wanna have a bunch of babies,

402
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,560
 which are all really good things.

403
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,960
 And yet, because they rush into it,

404
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,960
 they bring with them unresolved problems

405
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,540
 and unnecessary pain.

406
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
 It's interesting.

407
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,380
 When you look at the primary causes of divorce

408
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,540
 in the United States,

409
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,840
 reasons like lack of commitment, infidelity, and arguing,

410
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,800
 AKA selfishness, lust, and pride

411
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,840
 are the primary perpetrators.

412
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,000
 Let me ask, do you think those things

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,040
 just magically materialized in the altar?

414
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,000
 Like the minute they said, "I do,"

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,440
 and those wedding bells rang, it was like,

416
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,640
 "Oh my gosh, I hate your guts."

417
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,400
 Like, no, that's not where it happened.

418
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,960
 It happened as two people,

419
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,660
 one bride and one groom walked down that aisle.

420
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,600
 As they walked towards that altar,

421
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,360
 those preexisting issues came with them.

422
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
 Now, let me be abundantly clear.

423
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,480
 I am not telling you that you need to be perfect

424
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,680
 before you enter into marriage,

425
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,200
 but I am saying you need to be prepared.

426
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,680
 You see, contrary to what people often think,

427
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,860
 marriage does not minimize your problems,

428
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,700
 it magnifies your problems.

429
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,320
 Like having sex in marriage

430
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,420
 is not going to solve your lust issue.

431
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,200
 If you won't while you're dating,

432
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,460
 what makes you think you will when you're married?

433
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,000
 It's hard to honor the commitment I do

434
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,600
 when you never did.

435
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,360
 And so it's worth working that out now.

436
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,960
 Ladies, gentlemen, listen to me.

437
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,680
 You need to evaluate, how does your partner speak to you?

438
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,840
 Like guys, if she is always making a little thing

439
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,000
 out of a big, or making a big thing out of a little thing,

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,860
 or if she's constantly comparing your shortcomings

441
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,920
 to her best friend's husband's strengths,

442
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,640
 you don't wanna saddle up 'til death do you part with that.

443
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,160
 That's a hard way of life.

444
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,160
 Ladies, listen, if he's wrestling with pornography now,

445
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,880
 you're not going to solve that.

446
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,480
 You're not going to fix it.

447
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,200
 The day that you go on your honeymoon,

448
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,640
 it won't resolve the issue.

449
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,320
 It might slow the problem,

450
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,280
 it might not progress as quick at first,

451
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
 but it will eventually return.

452
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,040
 Marriage does not, it does not minimize your problems,

453
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,600
 it magnifies them.

454
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,480
 So it's really worth asking yourself,

455
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,880
 given the fact that if you don't deal with it today,

456
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,980
 others will have to deal with it tomorrow.

457
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,880
 Where are you struggling with sexual sin right now?

458
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,120
 Knowing that infidelity

459
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
 is one of the primary causes of divorce,

460
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,680
 it begs the question,

461
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,880
 where are you sexually struggling today?

462
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,360
 Like where are you making an allowance for it?

463
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
 Like is it in the shows you watch?

464
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,680
 Oh, but Colin, I skipped the nude scenes.

465
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,920
 Is it in the books you read?

466
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,680
 I didn't know that that was in there.

467
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,400
 Is it the thirst trap you follow?

468
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,720
 No comment.

469
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,360
 Is it the reels you watch?

470
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,340
 But listen, man, I can't help

471
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,880
 that the algorithm puts that in front of me.

472
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
 You might be making an allowance for it

473
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,800
 if you're coming up with excuses like that.

474
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,360
 Where's selfishness in your life?

475
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,120
 Like when things get really hard,

476
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,160
 like when things get really tough, what do you do?

477
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,740
 Like, do you stay committed?

478
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,880
 Do you lean in or do you opt out?

479
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,660
 Do you choose to cope in some other kind of way?

480
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,960
 Do you find yourself getting sketchy

481
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,160
 as opposed to sticking to your word?

482
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,880
 Are you reliable or are you unreliable?

483
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,160
 Selfish people, they think of themselves.

484
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,960
 That's why it's called selfishness.

485
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
 How about pride?

486
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,600
 Where's pride in your life?

487
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,440
 Like what does it look like

488
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
 for people to have conversation with you?

489
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
 Are you always the first one to speak up

490
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,680
 and the last one to listen?

491
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,840
 Are you the strongest voice in the room?

492
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
 Are you the kind of person that whenever conflict arises,

493
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,600
 your instinctual response is defensiveness?

494
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,960
 Do people fold like a lawn chair whenever conflict gets up

495
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,980
 because they're just like, man, it is not worth it with you.

496
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,840
 That could lead to anger.

497
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,940
 It's good for you to evaluate.

498
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,400
 Where, God, do I need to grow?

499
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
 Because I want to deal with this now

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,640
 so that they don't have to deal with it then.

501
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,580
 You see, perhaps your season of singleness

502
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,600
 isn't as miserable as it is merciful of God

503
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
 to give you a chance to work it out.

504
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,840
 You ever thought about that?

505
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,840
 Like it is his mercy that leaves you where you are

506
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,880
 so you can work out the kinks,

507
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,820
 you can figure out the difference.

508
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,660
 One of my favorite scriptures is Psalm 51, eight.

509
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,360
 David, on the heels of his very worst moment,

510
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
 he says, God, let the bones that you have broken rejoice.

511
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,000
 It's good, God, that you break me

512
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,600
 so that way I can become more like you.

513
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,280
 This is what God may be trying to do in your life.

514
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,960
 Now, let me just be really fair.

515
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,600
 Everything we've processed here,

516
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,160
 those are moral issues,

517
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,000
 but not every reason you may not be ready

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,120
 is necessarily moral.

519
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,640
 Sometimes it's situational.

520
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,040
 Sometimes the situation may simply say,

521
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,160
 you're not ready for it right now.

522
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,280
 It's not a good idea.

523
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,500
 If you don't have a job, you're not ready to date.

524
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,380
 You're certainly not ready for marriage.

525
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,160
 And that's not a shame-filled comment.

526
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,080
 I'm not criticizing anybody's situation.

527
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,160
 But what you have to understand is

528
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
 if dating leads to marriage,

529
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,920
 then ultimately you're gonna have to provide

530
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,860
 for someone else.

531
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,360
 So you probably should figure out what a check looks like

532
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,660
 before you jump into a relationship.

533
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,280
 Or maybe you're moving cities.

534
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
 You picked up a new job

535
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,520
 and you're actually gonna be leaving town.

536
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,320
 It's not a good idea to jump into a relationship now

537
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,700
 knowing that that relationship is not going to inevitably,

538
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,000
 but very quickly end.

539
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,940
 If your station is urgently expiring,

540
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,760
 then don't get into a relationship with someone.

541
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,480
 Don't emotionally entangle when it is unnecessary.

542
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,720
 And sometimes it's not moral or situational, it's personal.

543
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,580
 Like some of you, you're coming off of a breakup.

544
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,940
 And so what's good is for you to actually close the book

545
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,700
 on that chapter before you open up the book on the next

546
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
 and you start writing a new story.

547
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,600
 Others, you're processing some pain

548
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,560
 from someone that hurt you in the past.

549
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,440
 And so you should focus on that and find healing

550
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,860
 rather than divide your attention

551
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
 and make yourself vulnerable too soon.

552
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,100
 I don't know what it may be for you,

553
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,940
 but listen, it's worth investigating.

554
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,420
 Now to close this point, let me just let you know.

555
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,920
 Does this mean you're never going to be ready?

556
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,620
 Well, Kyla, that standard feels ridiculous.

557
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,100
 I don't know that I'm ever gonna actually amount

558
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,940
 to what I need to become

559
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,140
 so that when God will give me what I want.

560
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,580
 No, you will be ready.

561
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,780
 In God's timing, it will happen.

562
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,040
 What we know is that the nation of Israel,

563
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,720
 they eventually do go to the promised land.

564
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,240
 They finally journey north.

565
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,920
 And what they do is they not only kick the Philistines,

566
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,080
 but they conquer the entire territory.

567
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
 You see, God, He led them to a place

568
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,760
 where they could become prepared.

569
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,280
 Their frailty yesterday was replaced

570
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,620
 by formidability tomorrow,

571
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,800
 because they walked in the wilderness with God.

572
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,300
 Your season of singleness, it might be a wilderness.

573
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,080
 It might be the desert to your soul.

574
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,480
 And yet God's gonna use it to strengthen you,

575
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,380
 to build you up so He can lead you forth

576
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,360
 in His timing, according to His will.

577
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,320
 He doesn't owe it to you, but He's gracious to His people.

578
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,280
 That's the first reason.

579
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,360
 Second reason we gotta know is you may be single

580
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,580
 because you're waiting for the one.

581
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
 Ooh.

582
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,520
 You want love like Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.

583
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,140
 Yeah, like Jim and Pam.

584
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,300
 Like Han Solo and Princess Leia.

585
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,740
 Like Troy and Gabriella.

586
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,900
 Like Neo and Trinity.

587
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,540
 Like Shrek and Fiona.

588
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,340
 You want to find your soulmate.

589
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,500
 I wasn't sure how relevant this actually was

590
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,480
 for our current society.

591
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,620
 It felt like a thing of the past,

592
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,820
 and so I just did a little bit of research.

593
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:01,020
 And what I found is that YouGov actually found

594
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,020
 of American adults, 60% agreed to believing

595
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,580
 that soulmates still exist,

596
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,420
 that there's someone who will complete me.

597
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,300
 Which is a really nice idea.

598
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,900
 I could get behind that,

599
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,620
 if not for the fact that it's wrong.

600
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,140
 And the reason we know that it's wrong

601
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,160
 is because God speaks about the purpose of marriage

602
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,540
 all throughout His scripture.

603
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,020
 And as He does, He tells us,

604
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,780
 hey, the purpose of marriage isn't to satisfy

605
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,740
 your every longing through another person.

606
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,140
 That's not what it exists for.

607
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,340
 He actually, in the book of Ephesians,

608
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,300
 through the author Paul,

609
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,980
 He tells us the most exalted view of marriage,

610
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,980
 and He gives us a two-fold functionality

611
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,660
 for why it exists.

612
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,800
 I would encourage you, go read all of Ephesians 5.

613
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,580
 But just to catch us up with a couple of verses,

614
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,380
 it says this, "Therefore, a man shall leave his father

615
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,120
 "and his mother and hold fast to his wife,

616
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,520
 "and the two shall become one flesh."

617
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,860
 Meaning there's an inward orientation.

618
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,680
 This mystery is profound.

619
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,420
 That mystery echoed, or that mystery spoken of

620
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,740
 in Genesis 2, it echoes here into the present,

621
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,860
 and yet Paul tells us the explanation

622
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,260
 that it refers to Christ and the church,

623
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,020
 which is an outward orientation.

624
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,460
 What's Paul saying?

625
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,020
 What's that two-fold functionality?

626
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,300
 First, marriage is a model.

627
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,860
 Marriage is a model.

628
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,380
 It is an example, a representation to the watching world

629
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,980
 and to you and your spouse.

630
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,380
 What it looks like to love one another

631
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,980
 is Christ loves the church.

632
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,960
 But then also, marriage is a mission,

633
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,420
 in that the mission of your marriage

634
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,760
 isn't just to stare longingly into each other's eyes,

635
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,760
 but to link arms and to run forward into the cause of Christ

636
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,140
 for he left his father and he came in search of us

637
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,580
 to redeem us, to bring us back to himself

638
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,840
 by way of living the perfect life,

639
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,480
 dying the perfect death, and rising forth from the grave,

640
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,840
 that we might have faith in him,

641
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,700
 should we place our trust and live with him forevermore.

642
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,740
 This is an incredibly profound perspective

643
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,040
 that the Bible gives on the topic of marriage.

644
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,880
 And it is wildly different

645
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,720
 than what the rest of the world is trying to tell you,

646
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,400
 because according to the soulmate myth,

647
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,360
 marriage does not exist

648
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,800
 so that way you can serve someone else

649
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,440
 or so that way you can serve the rest of the world.

650
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,280
 That's strange.

651
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,000
 No, the soulmate myth would say,

652
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,880
 marriage exists for someone to serve me.

653
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,640
 I want someone to step into my life

654
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,320
 and fill the emotional vacancies deep within

655
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,480
 to assuage all of my romantic restlessness.

656
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,280
 And while some of you hear that and you think to yourself,

657
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
 that is ridiculous, Kylan.

658
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,400
 I'm not a part of that 60%.

659
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,640
 I don't believe that this is actually true.

660
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,280
 You are nonetheless trained to hunt for the perfect person.

661
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,160
 And it's not your fault.

662
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,200
 Like we live in a culture today

663
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,040
 where we know relation shopping is at an all-time high.

664
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,480
 You can swipe through an endless pool of potential suitors.

665
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,920
 You can refine specific romantic search criteria,

666
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,280
 and you can filter your way

667
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,720
 to a preferred combination of specific attributes.

668
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,760
 Whatever your romantic shopping list,

669
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,960
 you can build it out and you can search the world

670
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,640
 for those perfect ingredients.

671
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:11,760
 That's why ladies, you wanted to be 6'2",

672
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,940
 hyper-masculine, but also hypersensitive.

673
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,860
 You wanted to be emotionally intelligent,

674
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,080
 but also the life of the party,

675
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,800
 capable of raising wonderful kids,

676
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,240
 but also capable of reading your mind

677
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
 because you're just tired of having to draw pence

678
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,520
 so that way he might know what you actually want.

679
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,160
 Let me just help you understand.

680
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,080
 That doesn't exist.

681
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,560
 That man is nowhere to be found.

682
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,400
 He is not in this room.

683
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,220
 He is not in that room.

684
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,960
 He is not in any room ever.

685
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,800
 You see, he didn't go to the coffee shop

686
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,120
 because he knew you'd be there.

687
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,000
 He didn't post that thing on Instagram

688
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
 because he knew you'd be looking.

689
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,100
 He doesn't have a girl brain.

690
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,400
 He has man brain.

691
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,520
 Man brain, simple.

692
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,560
 Woman brain, sophisticated.

693
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,460
 Just know that that's what you're crossing paths with.

694
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,360
 Gentlemen, so many of you,

695
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,040
 you're looking for a girl that likes her steak medium rare,

696
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,880
 not medium well.

697
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,560
 Can I get an amen?

698
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,760
 Is always down to hit balls at the range

699
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,880
 and never gives you grief if you want to go

700
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,680
 play a little twilight round at the end of the day.

701
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,440
 She loves hanging with the boys,

702
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
 would rather watch the game tonight

703
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,520
 than talk about that fight

704
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,960
 that she's having with her friends.

705
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,600
 You see, what you want to find

706
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,720
 is basically your friend, Rick.

707
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,400
 You know, like that's what you're trying to look for.

708
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,880
 The guy that's sitting right to your left

709
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,720
 or right to your right.

710
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
 That's the guy that you kind of want to put a band on

711
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,640
 and say, "Hey man, let's journey

712
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,560
 through the rest of life together."

713
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,520
 But praise God, that's not God's design

714
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,280
 because what you need, brother, is help.

715
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,520
 That's what we all need.

716
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
 God says so at the beginning.

717
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,760
 And so we know we've got to find someone different

718
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,600
 than ourselves.

719
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
 You see, we live in a culture

720
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,440
 that is wracked with unrealistic expectations

721
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,120
 and over emphasis on physical appearance,

722
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,880
 a deep sense of decision fatigue

723
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,680
 and this fear of missing out

724
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,840
 all because you're searching for the one

725
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,280
 or you're trying to be the one

726
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,800
 that someone is searching for.

727
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,440
 But hear me, what if instead of entrusting yourself

728
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,800
 to some romantic shopping list or algorithm online,

729
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 you entrusted yourself to God instead?

730
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,560
 Because while there is no perfect match

731
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,280
 in a world filled with imperfect people,

732
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,920
 there is a perfect God who can satisfy you instead.

733
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,640
 Scriptures are loaded with this.

734
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,920
 Book of Psalms tells us in Psalm 90, 14,

735
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:31,080
 satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love,

736
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,200
 your love, oh God, I don't want the love of anyone else.

737
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,320
 Your love will satisfy me that we may rejoice

738
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,680
 and be glad in all our days.

739
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,620
 Psalm 60, 35, my soul, you want a soulmate,

740
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,460
 will be satisfied in the Lord as with fat and rich food.

741
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,720
 Psalm 107, nine, for he,

742
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,740
 talking about God satisfies the longing soul.

743
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,240
 You longing for love, he's the one that satisfies it.

744
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,360
 In the hungry soul, he fills with good things.

745
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,060
 Psalm 65, four, blessed is the one that you choose

746
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,280
 and you bring near to dwell in your courts,

747
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,160
 to be in your house, to make your life alongside.

748
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,940
 We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house

749
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,100
 and the holiness of your temple.

750
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,780
 You do not have to wait to find someone

751
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,340
 to satisfy the every longing of your soul

752
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,500
 because the only one who can has already found you.

753
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,420
 Jesus, the satisfier of your soul has sought you out.

754
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,180
 Therefore, you need not seek anyone else out.

755
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,980
 I'm not saying you shouldn't.

756
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,660
 I'm not saying marriage is bad,

757
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,420
 but I am saying if you load the pressure

758
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,460
 and expectation of someone solving all the deep complexities

759
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,580
 and intricacies of who you are, that will never happen.

760
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,520
 Christ in Christ alone can do that.

761
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,940
 Let me be clear.

762
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,020
 I am not telling you to stop looking.

763
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,940
 As I say this, I'm not saying,

764
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,300
 well, just fold your arms and cross your legs

765
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,140
 and tap your toe.

766
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,020
 Like that's not what I'm processing with you here.

767
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,860
 What you have to understand is that

768
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,280
 while you shouldn't look for the one,

769
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,420
 you also need to look for someone

770
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,860
 because the goal of your singleness

771
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,700
 is not to find the one who can satisfy you.

772
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,120
 It is to find someone who can glorify him.

773
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,440
 That's what you're looking for.

774
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,180
 Now, some of you, you're deeply content in your singleness.

775
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,620
 You might be called to it for a lifetime

776
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,180
 and that's a really good thing.

777
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,300
 But for others of you that are wanting for this,

778
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,860
 that's what you're looking for,

779
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,620
 which begs the question, what do they look like?

780
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,380
 Well, let me tell you, in the weeks to come,

781
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,800
 you'll have to come back 'cause I'm gonna make sure

782
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,260
 that you learn all of the details

783
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,340
 of what you need be looking for.

784
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,620
 But I'll give you a teaser.

785
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,260
 That person should love Christ more than they love you.

786
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,460
 That person should not be so concerned

787
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,900
 with grabbing hold of some guy or grabbing hold of some girl

788
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,420
 but instead grabbing hold of him

789
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,820
 because in their mind's eye,

790
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,820
 he is theirs before anyone else's.

791
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,060
 You want someone like that, that sees the things of God

792
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,500
 and says, I'm going for it, I'm racing for it.

793
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,540
 If you wanna come with me, then let's do it

794
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,940
 because this is a journey worthy going on.

795
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,140
 This is a cause worth giving our lives for.

796
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,380
 This is a purpose that transcends

797
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,700
 any other purpose in this world.

798
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,180
 But I'm going after him.

799
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,780
 I'm not coming after you.

800
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,180
 That's what you're looking for,

801
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,220
 someone whose allegiance is to Jesus.

802
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,820
 Now, the third reason why you may still be single

803
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,540
 if you don't wanna be is fear of commitment,

804
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,220
 fear of commitment.

805
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,940
 It's interesting, when I was researching for the series,

806
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,040
 I was just trying to catch up on the landscape of love,

807
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,540
 which kind of, it evolves.

808
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,260
 Every couple of years, you see that

809
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,220
 the romantic realm of our world,

810
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,220
 it just, it grows, it adapts, it adds to itself.

811
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,740
 And so what I knew was that in our culture,

812
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:20,860
 there's a large word bank of alternate relationship

813
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,100
 structures to help us define what's actually going on here.

814
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,180
 And yet, as I did the research, I realized

815
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,540
 I did not know nearly as much as I thought I would

816
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,500
 because what I found were a variety of terms

817
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,860
 that you and I may already know,

818
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,460
 things like situationships and open relationships

819
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,620
 and friends with benefits, all of that kind of stuff.

820
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,540
 But I also learned terms like polycules

821
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,420
 and hierarchical polyamory,

822
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:49,580
 and I learned about sex interviews and serial monogamy.

823
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,260
 I don't expect you to be familiar

824
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,840
 with all the varying fluid forms of relationship status,

825
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,820
 but what I do want us to know is they all exist

826
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,660
 for the same singular reason.

827
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,740
 People fear commitment.

828
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,180
 That's what they are.

829
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,740
 That's why they exist.

830
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,020
 They exist because they're trying to help you

831
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,500
 enjoy the benefits of a relationship

832
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,620
 without bearing any of the responsibilities

833
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,100
 of caring for another person.

834
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,900
 Paul knows we fear this so much so

835
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,180
 that in 1 Corinthians 7, he actually addresses the topic.

836
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,540
 He says, right after verse 35,

837
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,380
 where he defines the purpose for it,

838
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,820
 this in 36 and 37, that if anyone thinks

839
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,980
 that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed,

840
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,920
 if his passions are strong, and it has to be,

841
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,860
 let him do as he wishes, let them marry.

842
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,040
 It's no sin.

843
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,740
 But whoever is firmly established in his heart

844
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,020
 being under no necessity,

845
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,740
 but having his desire under control,

846
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,380
 and he's determined this in his heart

847
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,940
 to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.

848
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
 What's Paul saying?

849
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:55,420
 If you wanna be together, you can't stop talking.

850
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,740
 You can't stop texting.

851
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,880
 You can't stop thinking.

852
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,860
 You can't stop touching.

853
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,800
 Then be together, get married.

854
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,020
 Like that's what he's saying.

855
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,060
 He's like, hey, you don't necessarily need to do this

856
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,160
 in a sinful way where we're gonna make an accommodation

857
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,180
 for all of our unbridled passion.

858
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,180
 But what you need to do is you need to process

859
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,820
 that stuff out, you need to bring community into it.

860
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,700
 And then once it feels like it's been redeemed,

861
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,500
 you need to take a step, make a decision, and get married.

862
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,460
 And if you wanna be single,

863
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,500
 man, you just love this stage of life.

864
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,900
 God's really teaching you something right now.

865
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,380
 There's some things that you're trying to work out.

866
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,540
 Then be single.

867
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,380
 Like that's okay.

868
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,380
 His point is make a decision, commit one way or the other.

869
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,000
 That's what he means when he says be firmly established.

870
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,700
 That word in Greek, it is the derivative of a word

871
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,740
 that means to sit.

872
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,980
 So Paul is saying be firmly established.

873
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,700
 Hey, why don't you settle down, get sedentary?

874
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,700
 He wants you to adopt this picture

875
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,880
 of sitting and staying a while

876
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,520
 with whatever decision you decide.

877
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,580
 Like don't keep moving about with like this anxious energy

878
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,420
 of like, well, I think I wanna be single,

879
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,240
 but I think I wanna be dating.

880
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,340
 I kinda wanna live in both worlds.

881
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,320
 Don't do that.

882
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,540
 But so many singles in our world, they do this.

883
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,840
 I did this.

884
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,460
 This is a common practice.

885
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,000
 Like instead of making a decision

886
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,280
 and sitting where we say,

887
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,480
 what we instead do is we flirt.

888
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,400
 Like you text her late at night,

889
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,420
 the hour when really it's not appropriate for you to,

890
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,040
 but it's gonna get her mind going.

891
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,680
 You stop by his desk just to say hi and chat.

892
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,480
 And you know, you look good today

893
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,880
 and he needs to know it too.

894
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,920
 You make an effort in a public place

895
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,940
 where both of you are present to seek her out.

896
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,120
 Even though it's inconvenient,

897
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,720
 someplace maybe like the porch.

898
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,720
 You like his Insta story.

899
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,000
 You share something on direct message.

900
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 You go out of your way to express interest.

901
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
 But I would never ever enter into a relationship

902
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,440
 with that person.

903
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,120
 That would ruin the friendship.

904
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,240
 I don't necessarily want anything serious.

905
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,640
 I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun right now.

906
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,160
 So many of us are not firmly established because we flirt.

907
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
 Others of us are not firmly established

908
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
 because we date casually.

909
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,800
 I'm not trying to load a bunch of pressure on dating.

910
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,160
 But what I do wanna say is if you're dating

911
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
 for the simple sake of fun, you might need to slow down

912
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,000
 because often what happens when we're in that pursuit

913
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,120
 is we build emotional bonds with people.

914
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,540
 We bend some physical boundaries.

915
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,860
 It feels good to be wanted.

916
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,560
 We break spiritual rules.

917
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,160
 Like, listen, man, I know I'm not supposed

918
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,500
 to date a non-believer, but it's nothing serious.

919
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,440
 We're just having fun.

920
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,680
 They're a nice guy, super moral.

921
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,240
 They might believe one day.

922
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,560
 And what happens is you express

923
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,880
 that you're not firmly established.

924
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,140
 Others are delaying their proposal.

925
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,840
 You've been dating more than two years.

926
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,440
 And so she starts to wonder, like, I wonder,

927
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
 what is this, you know?

928
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,400
 Like, this thing's gonna go the distance.

929
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,240
 We made it two years.

930
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,400
 Like, this thing looks really awesome.

931
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,000
 But then that slips into three years.

932
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,240
 And so she's kind of confused.

933
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,600
 Her family's peppering her with questions.

934
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,680
 And yet she's committed, you know, it's awesome.

935
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,220
 It's been three years, a little longer than I thought,

936
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,080
 but we're gonna make it.

937
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,280
 But then it slips into four years.

938
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,640
 And now she's frustrated,

939
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,880
 but she's deeply invested in this thing.

940
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,280
 Like, I'm aging.

941
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,400
 It's been four years.

942
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,680
 I think you are who I think you are,

943
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,520
 but this doesn't seem to make sense.

944
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,320
 And then it bleeds into five years.

945
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,220
 And what you find is that she's emotionally exhausted,

946
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,760
 waiting around for you to pop the question,

947
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,600
 to bend the knee.

948
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,960
 She is seeing that the market is currently flooded

949
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
 with new dating prospects.

950
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,240
 And she just doesn't have the stamina to get back out there.

951
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
 So she waits around for your sorry, bud.

952
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,580
 I wanna be really clear.

953
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:51,360
 This is a very cruel thing to do to someone.

954
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:58,280
 To string them along with the promise of forever,

955
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,620
 but never the intent of actually delivering.

956
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,920
 Don't do that.

957
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,800
 That's a cruel thing to do.

958
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,380
 It's not family established.

959
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,660
 And the last is the eternal engagement.

960
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,640
 Where you did put a ring on it,

961
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,340
 but we've moved in together and we're splitting the bills

962
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,600
 and we share the same groceries and we love to cook dinner

963
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,680
 and we're already having sex.

964
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,500
 And you know what?

965
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,400
 The formality of a big wedding, that crazy event,

966
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,880
 I don't know that I necessarily wanna invest in that.

967
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,100
 And so you push and you push and you push.

968
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,080
 You're not firmly established.

969
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,160
 Now, let me be really clear.

970
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,900
 I am not saying in any way that commitment is easy.

971
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,960
 Take it from somebody that loved his single years

972
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,260
 and all the option value that it brought.

973
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,040
 Commitment is hard.

974
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,340
 And some of you have very legitimate reasons

975
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,580
 for why commitment is hard.

976
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,980
 Like you never grew up in a home

977
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,340
 where you saw a healthy, loving, committed relationship.

978
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,500
 You were involved with someone

979
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,100
 and they took advantage of you.

980
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,060
 They took something from you that was not theirs to have,

981
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,740
 or you've put yourself out there.

982
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,540
 You've heard sermons like this

983
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
 about walking across the room.

984
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,560
 And so you've done the effort, you've made the move,

985
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,780
 and yet you've been rejected, you've been ghosted,

986
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,740
 you've been belittled.

987
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,100
 And so you just don't have what it takes any longer

988
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,880
 to keep putting yourself out there.

989
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,700
 I don't know what it is for you,

990
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,040
 but here's what you need to know.

991
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,720
 You will never heal from it if you only hide from it.

992
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,480
 You'll never heal from it if you only hide from it.

993
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,940
 You have to be willing to pull that out

994
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,260
 if you want to actually re-engage commitment.

995
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,620
 And the good news is, despite whatever hurt you have,

996
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,640
 or whatever it is you're ashamed of,

997
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,740
 or you're embarrassed about,

998
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,040
 Jesus was committed to you anyways.

999
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,540
 He looked at the worst of you,

1000
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,300
 that which you did, that which you will do,

1001
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,560
 that which was done, that which will be done.

1002
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,980
 And he said, "I'm in for this.

1003
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,120
 "I'm committed to you,

1004
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,620
 "so much so that I will walk the road you cannot walk.

1005
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,420
 "I will live the life you cannot live.

1006
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,960
 "I will die the death that you deserve.

1007
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,520
 "I will take my life back up in my own hand,

1008
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,980
 "and I will rise forth from the grave

1009
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,460
 "that if anyone wants to place their faith in me,

1010
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,840
 "they can be with me forever.

1011
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,360
 "That's how committed I am to you.

1012
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,100
 "You want to know the depth of my commitment?

1013
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,300
 "Look to Calvary,

1014
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,860
 "because it declares in my mind's eye,

1015
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,460
 "I am committed to this.

1016
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,760
 "Not just today, not just tomorrow,

1017
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,820
 "not just for this life.

1018
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,100
 "I am committed to you, to us forever."

1019
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,600
 That's what Jesus has done.

1020
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,160
 And if you learn a commitment like his,

1021
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,300
 then you can overcome whatever hardship you have.

1022
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,040
 Now, let me be quick to finish here.

1023
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,040
 Some of you are sitting in this room and you're thinking,

1024
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,500
 "Kyle and I agree, but none of this is true for me."

1025
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,500
 And that's not a prideful comment.

1026
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,780
 I am ready.

1027
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,180
 I know God's still teaching me things,

1028
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,580
 but God's teaching everybody something.

1029
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,780
 I walk with him daily.

1030
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,600
 I read his word regularly.

1031
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,880
 I make sure to pray,

1032
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,140
 not because I've got to get my prayers in,

1033
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,900
 but because I love to talk and process with the Lord.

1034
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,820
 I'm ready.

1035
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,500
 Or you're sitting here and you're thinking to yourself,

1036
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,340
 "I'm not in search of the one.

1037
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,460
 "I've already found him.

1038
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,300
 "I found the one.

1039
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,220
 "I know there's only one worthy of seeking,

1040
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,820
 "and his name is Jesus."

1041
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,140
 And you're thinking to yourself,

1042
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,560
 like, "I'm not afraid of commitment.

1043
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,720
 "I just have no one to commit to.

1044
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,240
 "What other possible reason does God have for me?

1045
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,180
 "Why would he leave me in this spot?

1046
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,840
 "If he's so good, if this is desirable,

1047
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,120
 "if it is purposeful, then why?"

1048
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,580
 Because it's just not time.

1049
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,920
 That's the fourth reason.

1050
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,920
 And it is probably the hardest one to receive.

1051
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:08,980
 In the book of Lamentations, which is a book of mourning,

1052
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,900
 it's actually, it's five funeral poems right at the center

1053
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,860
 of what I think is a scripture for you.

1054
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,680
 It says this, Lamentations 3, starting in verse 24.

1055
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,680
 "The Lord is my portion, says my soul.

1056
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,560
 "Therefore I will hope in him.

1057
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,940
 "The Lord is good to those who wait for him,

1058
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,420
 "to the soul who seeks him.

1059
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,100
 "It's good that one should wait quietly

1060
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,940
 "for the salvation of the Lord.

1061
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,780
 "It is good for a man that he bears the yoke of his youth."

1062
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,080
 Twice in that passage, it says that it is good

1063
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,940
 to wait for the Lord, which is surprising

1064
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,520
 because it feels pretty bad, doesn't it?

1065
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,260
 Like, our world is obsessed with convenience.

1066
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,220
 No one's still riding horseback from one place to the next

1067
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,480
 because it's not nearly as efficient as a motor vehicle.

1068
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,540
 No one likes to wait five to seven business days

1069
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,820
 to get anything on their doorstep

1070
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,120
 because you can just prime it and have it here

1071
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,100
 in less than two days instead.

1072
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,860
 Like, we know that convenience is not something we opt for,

1073
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,220
 and yet, why then is waiting good?

1074
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:12,300
 Listen, because nothing worth having comes without waiting.

1075
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:18,100
 Nothing, nothing worth having comes without waiting.

1076
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,940
 If you think about it, you don't develop photos

1077
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,380
 in the sunlight, you take them into a dark room,

1078
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,020
 and yet, if you pull them out of that dark room

1079
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,300
 and you expose them to light too soon,

1080
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,380
 what happens to the photos?

1081
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,220
 They're ruined.

1082
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,820
 And yet, if you're patient, wait, give time,

1083
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,300
 and let those photos develop in the dark,

1084
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,140
 when they're ready, you pull them forth,

1085
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,620
 and what you find is something beautiful in the end.

1086
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:49,740
 God has left some of you for this reason alone

1087
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,220
 in a season of singleness,

1088
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,180
 which equates to a dark room experience

1089
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,900
 because he is trying to make something beautiful of you

1090
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,280
 that he may not make in any other way.

1091
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,660
 He's developing you.

1092
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:07,500
 He's preparing you, not just for marriage, but for himself.

1093
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,640
 He's making of you, not just a wife, not just a husband,

1094
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,620
 but one that looks like Christ.

1095
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,460
 You see, we do not get the promise that we will be married,

1096
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,820
 but what we do get is the promise

1097
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,180
 of a wedding that is to come,

1098
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,740
 one where we're united to not some random groom,

1099
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,500
 but to the perfect groom whose name is Jesus.

1100
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,500
 We see in him a groom that was always ready,

1101
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,260
 never needed to get himself right,

1102
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,540
 but was ready and willing to pursue us

1103
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,180
 when we were unwilling of being pursued.

1104
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,820
 We see in him the only perfect one

1105
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,740
 that has always been waiting for us.

1106
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,780
 And we see in Christ,

1107
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,060
 someone that never second guessed his commitment,

1108
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,820
 but said, "No, I am willing to express my commitment

1109
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,200
 "in the grandest of ways.

1110
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,940
 "I will live my life perfectly

1111
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,900
 "because you cannot in your sin.

1112
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,100
 "I'm gonna die, but not because I'm worthy.

1113
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,400
 "You are instead.

1114
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,120
 "And yet, because I lay down my life

1115
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,980
 "and I take it up by my own accord,

1116
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,020
 "I will rise forth from the grave

1117
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,800
 "that any who believe in me,

1118
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,860
 "they will have everlasting life.

1119
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:24,100
 "Not just heaven to come, but heaven right now

1120
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,220
 "because you get me."

1121
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,820
 And what we see in Jesus

1122
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,960
 is that he had to wait.

1123
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,460
 He waited for at the right time,

1124
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,380
 he died for the ungodly.

1125
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,220
 He died for you and me.

1126
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,740
 If you're ready to find love,

1127
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,580
 and listen, you need wait no longer, friend,

1128
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,020
 for love has found you.

1129
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,980
 Let me pray for you.

1130
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,580
 God, thank you for tonight.

1131
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,800
 Every moment over the course of a Tuesday is yours.

1132
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,220
 But God, this next moment, I pray you'd use.

1133
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,460
 I pray you'd work within the hearts of the people here

1134
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,460
 that you would stir within their souls to believe.

1135
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,140
 I ask God that people who may have come here

1136
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,980
 because they wanna learn some tips and tricks on dating

1137
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:23,220
 would actually learn something so much better,

1138
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,000
 so much richer, so much fuller instead,

1139
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,920
 that you love them.

1140
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,780
 And in you, they not only find all they need,

1141
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,060
 they find all they want.

1142
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,660
 God, we worship you now.

1143
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,420
 And it is in your name we pray, amen.

1144
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,540
 Hey, porch, let's stand together.

1145
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,100
 Right now, I know we've gone a little long.

1146
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,660
 Thanks for your patience.

1147
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,580
 Some of you wanna respond in this moment.

1148
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,180
 We've got a team down here to the right and to the left.

1149
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,520
 They would love to do that.

1150
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,980
 But this moment is a moment to process.

1151
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:59,180
 It is a moment to respond to the God who loves you.

1152
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,340
 Let's do that together.
