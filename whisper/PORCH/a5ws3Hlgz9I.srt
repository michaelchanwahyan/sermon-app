1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,720
 - Gather here.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,600
 Ah, this is fun, Cupid, we're back in it.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,800
 And so, as I thought about tonight,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,620
 you know, the thing, there's a part of this,

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,680
 which I love to do, and then there's a part of this

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,920
 that I'm just burdened to do,

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,040
 'cause it causes me to do a lot of reflecting,

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,840
 a lot of wrestling with the scripture.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,320
 I feel like this week, particularly,

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,680
 just a lot of wrestling in the past 48 hours, even,

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,360
 with a scripture.

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,760
 But as I thought back on my own dating life,

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,080
 like, I wish that I had this, okay?

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,400
 And so there's a part of me that's like,

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,000
 man, this is, you guys are here,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,440
 and I wish that someone would have told me

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,540
 that, you know, all the things that I was doing,

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,960
 that they would have said, hey, those are wrong,

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,140
 and here's the way, and I could, you know,

21
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,800
 sort the truth from the lies,

22
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,720
 and that's, I think, one of the most difficult things,

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,960
 is the world is constantly trying to get your attention,

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,280
 and so there's just a part of me that says,

25
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,800
 no, no, the world is doing it so wrong.

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,040
 And so, as I thought about how to start this tonight,

27
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,880
 I just, I want you guys to watch this clip.

28
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,600
 So here's my question for you.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,160
 Do you know where you're going?

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,760
 Do you know where you wanna be?

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
 Okay, we're talking about dating,

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,240
 and so as you consider dating,

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,180
 do you have a destination in mind?

34
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,080
 Because we all agree, like, there's something different

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
 when, there's something different from, like,

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
 putting in a destination into the GPS

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,120
 and driving intentionally to that destination.

38
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,560
 Remember when you would do it in high school?

39
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,200
 You kinda cruise the strip,

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,680
 or whatever you guys would call it, right?

41
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,640
 You just kinda drive aimlessly, okay?

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,800
 I did this, maybe I'm the only one in the room,

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,820
 but we would just kinda, you know,

44
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,920
 hey, mom and dad, I'm gonna go driving,

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
 and like, driving where?

46
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
 I don't know, just around.

47
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,360
 So that's, some of you, that's how you date.

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,040
 Like, you just go dating.

49
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,880
 Where's that going?

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,540
 I don't know, just kind of around, right?

51
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,880
 And then some of us, right,

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,560
 we understand that we have to go somewhere,

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
 and so strategy is this simple.

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,040
 I have a friend who graduated from Harvard Business School,

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,600
 and he was the lead strategic consultant

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,760
 of a leading hedge fund, and he says,

57
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,740
 "Strategy is this simple.

58
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,120
 "It's knowing where you are, knowing where you wanna be,

59
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,220
 "and then taking a step in that direction."

60
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,160
 Or he would say, "Formulating a plan to get there."

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,040
 And so for me, as I ask you guys,

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,400
 do you know where you want to go?

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,080
 Like, if I wanna go towards the back of this room,

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
 if I wanna head that direction,

65
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,680
 then I need to be facing that direction.

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,640
 And I know that seems like common sense,

67
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,960
 but some of us, we're saying, "Hey, we wanna be there,

68
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,800
 "but we're facing here when it comes to dating."

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,120
 We're going the wrong way,

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,960
 and we need to hear that at a head level and a heart level.

71
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,280
 And so tonight, I wanna talk about what it looks like

72
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,040
 to go the right way.

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,960
 What it, 'cause if we're not doing it the right way,

74
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,540
 right, we're doing it the wrong way,

75
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
 and the wrong way's gonna get us to the wrong location,

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,280
 the wrong destination.

77
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
 We're gonna continue to beat our head against the wall,

78
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,780
 and here's the crazy part about this.

79
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,600
 This is just pure logic.

80
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 Most people, by most I mean the majority, over 50%,

81
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,840
 do this the wrong way.

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
 How crazy is that?

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,760
 Right, they don't end up in the right destination.

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,120
 Literally, statistically, most people do not end up

85
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,160
 where they wanna be, and so how are you going to change that?

86
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,520
 Right, and the world has all of this,

87
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,280
 these rules and regulations for you.

88
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
 In fact, the myth this week,

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
 'cause we're busting these myths,

90
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,360
 the myth this week is that there's all of these rules

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
 to dating, there's not a bunch of rules.

92
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
 There's really just a few rules.

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,880
 So what the world tells you is that there's all of these

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,120
 rules to dating, and kind of above and beyond all of them

95
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,320
 is to follow your heart.

96
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,100
 Okay, in fact, I did a Google search, rules to dating,

97
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,680
 and it showed me 9,300,000 results.

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
 I'm talking dozens and dozens of books

99
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
 titled rules to dating.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
 I think, yeah, there you go.

101
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
 Just 9,300,000 results on a search,

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,380
 rules to dating, in quotes.

103
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,480
 How crazy is that?

104
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,500
 And then above all of them, it says, and follow your heart.

105
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,480
 And so what I want you to know tonight

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,520
 is that there's not that many rules to dating.

107
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,440
 I wanna make this simple, and really,

108
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,960
 I wanna make it worry-free for you.

109
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,000
 I wanna bring it down, and I wanna tell you,

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,480
 don't follow your heart, inform your heart.

111
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,960
 That's what the scripture says.

112
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,840
 Inform your heart.

113
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,680
 Tell your heart where it should go.

114
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,840
 Show it what is right so that it knows

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,800
 to pursue that thing, right?

116
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
 Because if you show it the wrong things,

117
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,920
 it's gonna chase the wrong things,

118
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,920
 and I think so many of us, we're going the wrong way.

119
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,040
 And so I know you're like, simple, worry-free,

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
 that's not dating.

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,960
 Well, the reason it's not dating

122
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,800
 is 'cause it involves our heart.

123
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,680
 Frankly, it's our heart that makes this difficult.

124
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,440
 It's us giving our heart to someone,

125
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,480
 or not knowing who to give our heart to,

126
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,960
 and then when they take it,

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,160
 and they do the wrong things with it,

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
 and then it's broken, and we're left hurt,

129
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,160
 and there's all of these things that are fallout

130
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,600
 from this word called dating that we're here to talk about.

131
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,440
 And so Jeremiah 17, nine says,

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,200
 "The heart is deceitful above all things,

133
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,560
 "and beyond cure, who can understand it?"

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,340
 Tonight, I just wanna give you a biblical dating strategy

135
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,360
 that goes beyond follow your heart.

136
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,480
 Here's really what I wanna do.

137
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,400
 You're gonna leave here,

138
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,840
 and most of you in the room tonight,

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
 most of you that wanna be married,

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,040
 you will be married, most of you.

141
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
 Okay, if that's your heart's desire,

142
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,800
 most of you, you will be.

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
 It's just a reality, okay?

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,580
 And then about half of you will be divorced.

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,440
 Just another reality, it's just a statistic.

146
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,480
 And the statistic, we know,

147
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,160
 is the same in the church and out of the church.

148
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
 And so what I wanna do for you,

149
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,360
 as the Spirit makes alive to us the word of God,

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,800
 is I wanna curve that statistic.

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
 Okay, I just wanna give you a better chance

152
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,680
 when you leave here than a 50/50 ending rate, okay?

153
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,720
 A 50/50 disaster rate, it's really higher than that

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,680
 because so many marriages that stay together

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,320
 aren't really marriages at all.

156
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,200
 So the disaster rate is so much higher than 50%.

157
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,360
 And I just wanna leave you here with a better chance

158
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,280
 of having a good, healthy, God-honoring relationship

159
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
 because God has some things to say to this.

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,360
 And so people, when they follow their heart,

161
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,200
 they come up with these really stupid ideologies.

162
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,780
 And I don't know how else to say it other than that,

163
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,640
 just really stupid ideas when they follow their heart.

164
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,180
 And so I heard this on the radio the other day.

165
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,800
 They're like, this girl's on the radio

166
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,040
 and she's talking about these people dating

167
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
 or thinking about getting married.

168
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,080
 And she's like, well, of course they're gonna live together

169
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 before they get married.

170
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
 Like, of course they're going to.

171
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,480
 And like, who would ever wanna marry someone

172
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,640
 without living together?

173
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,780
 And I just thought about that.

174
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,520
 And so I said, I wanna look at the data.

175
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,680
 And so we built a graph to show you today.

176
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,960
 And so here's the data.

177
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,440
 This is pure logic, okay?

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,920
 This is secular information, all right?

179
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,600
 So before you get angry, before you leave,

180
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,960
 I'm just presenting the facts to you.

181
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
 Think about this with a clear mind.

182
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,840
 You see that black line?

183
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,920
 Okay, that black line is the cohabitation rate.

184
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,800
 Simple as that.

185
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,140
 You see, before 1970, it was virtually nonexistent.

186
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,320
 In fact, it was illegal.

187
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,720
 Did you know that cohabitation today is still illegal

188
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,920
 in four states, in the United States of America?

189
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,080
 Fact, okay?

190
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,360
 And so before 1970, virtually nonexistent.

191
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
 You see how drastically it declines, or it inclines.

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
 Okay, that red line?

193
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,680
 That red line is the divorce rate.

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,120
 And you see how rapidly that increased, right?

195
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,880
 Right with, along with, as cohabitation increases,

196
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,440
 the divorce rate increases.

197
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,040
 Okay, but you say, well, wait a minute.

198
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,720
 You say, wait a minute, JP, right there about 1985,

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,240
 it seems like the divorce rate is going down a little bit.

200
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,760
 Okay, that's in numbers, not percentages, okay?

201
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,800
 So let me show you this.

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,480
 That blue line right there?

203
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,560
 That blue line, that is the marriage rate.

204
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
 You see what's happening?

205
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,880
 You see how that starts to go down?

206
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,220
 So people aren't getting divorced less.

207
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,840
 The divorce statistic has remained the same.

208
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,600
 The numbers are less because people are married less.

209
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,040
 That is just information.

210
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,920
 That's just data.

211
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
 You see how logic can debunk these things in the world

212
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,760
 that God says, no, no, no, no, I don't want you to do that

213
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,080
 because I love you and I want you to be

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,600
 in a healthy, God-honoring marriage.

215
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,060
 Where do you want to be, let me ask you.

216
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,200
 If you're dating, I hope one of the places

217
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,840
 where you want to be is in a marriage,

218
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
 but not just in a marriage.

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,420
 Like if you said that, when I say, hey,

220
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,260
 where do you want to be?

221
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,080
 You say, I want to be in a marriage.

222
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,920
 No, you don't.

223
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,000
 You want to be in a God-honoring marriage.

224
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,100
 You want to be in a healthy marriage

225
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,720
 to a wife or a husband who loves you

226
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,600
 as God has called them to, who cares for you.

227
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,000
 You want to be in an uncommon marriage,

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,300
 in a marriage that rarely exists today.

229
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,160
 Between two people who are fully committed to God first

230
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,080
 and then love each other out of the overflow

231
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,440
 of that commitment, that is what you want

232
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,360
 if you are looking to get married and want to get married.

233
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,920
 And so tonight, I just want to talk about

234
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,800
 how to get pointed in the right direction.

235
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,000
 How to stay within the lines.

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Like what are the principles

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
 that the Scriptures tell us to?

238
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
 I'm telling you, it's not a bunch of rules.

239
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,800
 It's just some kind of big principles to think through

240
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,960
 that are pretty self-evident, self-explanatory.

241
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,040
 And then before you leave here,

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,520
 just understanding the destination,

243
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,800
 where we're actually going.

244
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,960
 And so yesterday was February the 4th.

245
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
 Here's what that means for me.

246
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,840
 If I'm doing a Proverb a Day, on the 4th day,

247
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,880
 I read Proverbs 4.

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,640
 On the 27th day, I read Proverbs 27.

249
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,000
 And so kind of go along with that.

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
 And so yesterday was the 4th.

251
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,520
 I read Proverbs 4, and I just felt like the Lord

252
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,600
 gave me this verse to put before you.

253
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 And so this is Solomon, the wisest man in all the world,

254
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,640
 writing this thing.

255
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,960
 And so what's interesting is he's going to say,

256
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,160
 so he has all of this wisdom.

257
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,800
 Solomon, he writes this book

258
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,920
 called the Book of Wisdom, or Proverbs, right?

259
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,280
 He's the wisest man ever to live

260
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,720
 in the history of humanity.

261
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,120
 And he scribes these things down,

262
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
 and he gets down to this Proverbs 4.23,

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,760
 and it's a verse you've heard again.

264
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
 Again, much like Proverbs 31,

265
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,520
 it's one of those that either wants to make you throw up

266
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,500
 or like, yeah, that's truth.

267
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,000
 And so it's that one that says, guard your heart.

268
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,480
 Right, you ever heard that, guard your heart?

269
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,720
 Yeah, we don't know what that means, man.

270
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
 That's one of those things pastors say

271
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
 that sounds like, yeah, guard your heart.

272
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,200
 You're like, yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

273
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,120
 I have no idea what that means, you know?

274
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,840
 And so today I wanna talk about what does that mean?

275
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,040
 What does it mean to guard your heart?

276
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,000
 'Cause the scripture's gonna say, it's gonna tell us.

277
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,680
 And so this is what the wisest man

278
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,960
 in the history of the world says.

279
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
 He says, above all else,

280
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,800
 and all this other stuff I've written down,

281
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,480
 I've given you some real truths,

282
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,320
 I've given you some things to think about,

283
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
 I'm the wisest man ever to live,

284
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,800
 above everything else, guard your heart.

285
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,640
 For it is the wellspring of life.

286
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,520
 What does that mean, the wellspring of life?

287
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
 Here's what that means.

288
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,160
 It means that everything else in your life

289
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,040
 comes out of your heart's desires.

290
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,320
 Do you get that?

291
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,160
 That which your heart seeks, your body follows,

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,760
 your life follows.

293
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,800
 And so when your heart wants something, right,

294
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,280
 if you're not careful, then all of a sudden

295
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,400
 your whole entire life is over there.

296
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,560
 You feel that?

297
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,720
 You want something, and then your whole life,

298
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,400
 the trajectory of your life is following your heart.

299
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,440
 Guard your heart, above all else,

300
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,280
 for it is the wellspring of life.

301
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
 Life springs from it.

302
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,080
 Put away perversity from your mouth,

303
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,960
 keep corrupt talk from your lips,

304
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,600
 let your eyes look straight ahead,

305
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,880
 fix your gaze directly before you,

306
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
 make level paths for your feet,

307
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,680
 and take only ways that are firm.

308
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,160
 Do not swerve to the right or to the left,

309
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,280
 but keep your foot from evil.

310
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,600
 (congregation laughing)

311
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,120
 So it directs the rest of our life.

312
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
 And so what do we need to do?

313
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,920
 The first thing that we need to do

314
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,760
 is to give our heart instruction.

315
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,480
 Okay, I want you to give your heart instruction.

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
 I want you to think about it like this.

317
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,280
 Your heart is like a GPS.

318
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,840
 It is going to lead you.

319
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
 It is.

320
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,520
 It's going to tell you where to go.

321
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,120
 But what is the first thing you have to do with the GPS?

322
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,080
 You have to input your destination.

323
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,360
 So you tell your heart, this inner working device,

324
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,320
 this GPS inside of you,

325
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,480
 you ultimately, you tell it where to go,

326
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
 you inform it.

327
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
 And so what are the Proverbs before 23?

328
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
 You can mark this in your Bible.

329
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
 The Proverbs before 23, it says,

330
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,880
 hey, this is the truth.

331
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,040
 Write it on your heart.

332
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
 Bound it around your heart.

333
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,320
 Do not forget these things I've told you.

334
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,040
 This is the scripture, the holy word of God.

335
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,280
 And so you inform your heart with the truth

336
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,120
 of the creator of the heavens and the earth.

337
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
 You set the destination in your heart.

338
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,680
 You let your heart know, hey, this is where we're going.

339
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
 And then it will direct you.

340
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,520
 If you do not let it know where you are going,

341
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,800
 it will lead you off a cliff, man.

342
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,520
 It will lead you off a cliff.

343
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,420
 It's going to lead you, but you gotta tell it where to go.

344
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,000
 Woody Allen said,

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 when he had an affair with his wife's daughter,

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,360
 the famous line, the heart wants what it wants.

347
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,360
 Woody Allen was right.

348
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,760
 The heart does want what it's want.

349
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,400
 When his relationship with Soon-Yi did not last long,

350
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,520
 we know now that it's no longer existing.

351
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,240
 Evidently, the heart didn't want it very long.

352
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,840
 But that's how some of us think.

353
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,440
 We think with our heart.

354
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,220
 Listen to your heart.

355
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,000
 Got more of that.

356
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,240
 And so I want to exhort you tonight

357
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,260
 to not let an uninformed heart direct you.

358
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,640
 If you're not doing this God's way,

359
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
 I mean, this is cheesy, but it's true.

360
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
 If you're not doing it God's way,

361
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,400
 you're doing it the wrong way.

362
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 If you're doing it the world's way,

363
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,120
 you're doing it the wrong way.

364
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,720
 And so we've gotta recalibrate our heart, our GPS,

365
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,300
 and say, okay, what is God's way?

366
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,120
 That's the way I'm committed to doing it.

367
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
 He created everything.

368
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
 He loves me.

369
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,740
 He's real.

370
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,880
 I'm gonna be with him forever.

371
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,680
 He's purchased me by the blood of his son, Jesus Christ.

372
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,240
 And so I might as well do this thing the way that he wants.

373
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,200
 He's like a loving dad.

374
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,020
 So God, what do you want?

375
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,480
 How do you want me to do it?

376
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,080
 And so you're telling your heart what to pursue.

377
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,680
 If not, your heart's gonna tell you what to pursue.

378
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,200
 You're either telling your heart what to pursue

379
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,400
 or your heart is telling you what to pursue.

380
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,800
 And the reality of it is, is what you feed your heart,

381
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,360
 that's what it's going to lead you to.

382
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440
 Okay, this is truth now.

383
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,840
 I want you to hear this.

384
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,840
 What you put in your heart, what you feed your heart,

385
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
 that is what it's going to lead you to.

386
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,280
 So if you're feeding your heart junk from the tabloids

387
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,920
 and gossip from the TV and junk from music,

388
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,120
 I'm not trying to be legalistic now,

389
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,160
 I'm just being honest with you.

390
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
 If that's what you're feeding your heart,

391
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
 that's what it's going to lead you to.

392
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,240
 It's gonna start saying, hey, that's familiar,

393
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,200
 that's familiar, that's what you want, that's what you want.

394
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
 You want him.

395
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,920
 You want it that way.

396
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,280
 That's what he's going, right?

397
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,360
 That's what he's saying.

398
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,640
 And your heart's screaming that, right?

399
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,480
 It works like Netflix.

400
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,000
 You guys got Netflix, anybody?

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,680
 Love me some Netflix.

402
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,120
 We don't have cable, we just have Netflix.

403
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,280
 And so here's what Netflix does, is it's smart, this Netflix.

404
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,560
 It knows what shows I like, okay?

405
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,280
 It sees what shows I watch, and then it says,

406
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,680
 hey, here's some suggestions for you, Jonathan.

407
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,320
 And so what it does, if you go on my Netflix,

408
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,840
 what it suggests to you is Dora the Explorer

409
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,280
 and My Little Pony, because that's what my little girls

410
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
 watch all day long, right?

411
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
 Dora the Explorer, My Little Pony.

412
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,880
 And so you go on it, it starts to suggest it.

413
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,080
 So what happens, right, when I watch that documentary

414
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,320
 that was intriguing to me about pornography,

415
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,240
 which I didn't watch, but I was really tempted to,

416
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
 it starts saying, oh, pornography, here's what you want,

417
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,960
 here's what you want, this is what you want.

418
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,480
 Your heart works the same way.

419
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,280
 When you feed it crap from the TV,

420
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,320
 it's like, this is what you want.

421
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,640
 Go after that, that's what you want.

422
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,040
 When you go on Pinterest and you start, oh,

423
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,320
 lusting after a wedding dress, you know,

424
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,140
 that's what you want, that's ultimate.

425
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,680
 Nervous laughter.

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,080
 (congregation laughing)

427
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,440
 Please, no elbows tonight, no pointing, okay?

428
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,400
 And so don't let an uninformed heart guide you,

429
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,600
 but don't let a misinformed heart guide you either.

430
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,840
 Let me ask you this, guys,

431
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 don't let a misinformed heart guide you.

432
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,360
 Can a Christian be madly in love,

433
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
 head over heels in love,

434
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,360
 with someone who is no good for them?

435
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
 Let me ask you like this, can a Christian,

436
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,460
 can a follower of Jesus be head over heels,

437
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,640
 madly in love with a non-believer?

438
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,240
 Absolutely they can.

439
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
 Oh, I've sat with them, they have wept in my office.

440
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,720
 You're telling me what, I can't what?

441
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,880
 I'm not telling you anything, dude.

442
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,360
 2 Corinthians 6, 14, it's in the scripture.

443
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,320
 That's not me, that's God,

444
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,600
 that's the creator of the heavens and the earth.

445
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,480
 He loves you, by the way.

446
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,040
 See that pain that you feel right now?

447
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,680
 It's gonna pale in comparison to the pain that you feel.

448
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,040
 When a loving God says, hey, don't do that.

449
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,960
 He's not mad at you, he's not angry at you.

450
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,560
 He looks at you and he loves you.

451
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,400
 And he says, I want life for you.

452
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,560
 I teach that, every single time I've taught that,

453
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,200
 it's gotten me an angry email.

454
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,880
 And so one of you guys will email me angrily.

455
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,920
 And I'm just like, what are you,

456
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,780
 I'm the messenger, man.

457
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,200
 It's black and white in the word of God.

458
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,360
 God loves you, he's not trying to rip you off.

459
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,040
 He's trying to save your heart.

460
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,440
 Okay?

461
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,680
 He's trying to help you.

462
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,560
 He's trying to help you not be a statistic.

463
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,020
 Give you greater than 50/50 chance.

464
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,000
 You ever felt like, so can the heart,

465
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,960
 the heart wants what it wants.

466
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,040
 Sometimes the heart, you ever feel like

467
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,920
 you're going the right way,

468
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,440
 and all of a sudden you're not?

469
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,960
 You feel like you're on track, you know,

470
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,560
 you're not listening to GPS,

471
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,280
 you're just kind of driving by your senses,

472
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,320
 by your emotions, like I'm certain I'm going the right way.

473
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,680
 And you look up and you've been going

474
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,660
 like the 180 degrees in the wrong direction.

475
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,840
 Only me, you know?

476
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,960
 This is what it's like.

477
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,640
 We've gotta follow something other than

478
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,760
 an uninformed or a misinformed heart.

479
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,160
 Proverbs 24 says, put away perversity from your mouth.

480
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,060
 Keep corrupt talk far from your lips.

481
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,480
 Let your eyes look straight ahead.

482
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
 Fix your gaze directly before you.

483
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
 Make level paths for your feet.

484
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
 And take only ways that are firm.

485
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,560
 Okay, and so it's telling us the way that we should go,

486
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
 the way that we should go.

487
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,760
 But this idea of dating,

488
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,720
 you're really trying to find someone.

489
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,640
 You're trying to identify a person

490
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,640
 who you're willing to spend the rest of your life with.

491
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
 And so what are those things that you're supposed

492
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,080
 to be identifying in them?

493
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,200
 What are you looking for?

494
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,160
 And so I'm supposed to guard my heart,

495
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
 I'm supposed to protect it,

496
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,280
 I'm supposed to feed it healthy truth

497
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,760
 so it knows what's to look for.

498
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,840
 And so what should it look for?

499
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,880
 Well, the scripture says,

500
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,160
 and so my second point is protect your heart

501
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,040
 from people going the wrong way.

502
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,320
 There's people all around you,

503
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,920
 even this evening here, who are going,

504
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
 who are headed the wrong direction,

505
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,920
 and you don't want your heart to latch onto one of them.

506
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,720
 Because if you do, then they're gonna pull you

507
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
 in the wrong direction.

508
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,080
 They're gonna be driving down the wrong direction.

509
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,280
 Okay, and so what are those things that we can look at?

510
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,240
 I think there's three things, directly from the scripture.

511
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,680
 Number one, the speech.

512
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,400
 Number two, their focus.

513
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
 And number three, where they actually physically go.

514
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,480
 And so let's just talk about their speech for a second.

515
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,440
 This is something that you would observe in them.

516
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,300
 This is key, guys.

517
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,800
 This is key, ladies.

518
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,420
 Okay, their words are going to show you

519
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,040
 the contents of their heart.

520
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,520
 It's going to show you the way that their GPS works.

521
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,800
 This is straight from Jesus Christ himself,

522
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,360
 Matthew 12, verse 34, it says,

523
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,520
 "For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks."

524
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
 The words that come out of the mouth show,

525
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,040
 display the content of their heart.

526
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,680
 And so if they're angry, right,

527
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,120
 if they're constantly angry, they got an angry heart.

528
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,880
 Right, and so some of you, some of you are here tonight,

529
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,120
 and you're angry, and the reason you're angry

530
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,620
 is because you're not married.

531
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,720
 And it can be seen on you.

532
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,020
 Now you thought, man, I will never be 37.

533
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,000
 Or 42, or whatever, and single,

534
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,280
 that's just not what I thought.

535
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,640
 I didn't think this in the way it was going.

536
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,840
 And so now you're angry.

537
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,760
 Maybe you're angry at God, maybe you're angry at men,

538
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
 maybe you're angry at women.

539
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,420
 I don't know what you're angry at.

540
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:20,360
 But I strongly suggest that you go to the Spirit of God

541
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,380
 and say, what is it that you would have for me?

542
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,240
 Because I know James 1:19 says,

543
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,800
 "Our anger does not bring about

544
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,000
 "the righteous life that God desires."

545
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,080
 And so it's the great irony there

546
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,680
 is the reason you're not married

547
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,080
 is because you're angry that you're not married.

548
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,600
 You know, that's the thing that's keeping you single.

549
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,080
 How do they talk, do they gossip,

550
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,400
 are they talking about others?

551
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,800
 The person who's talking about others

552
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,520
 has nothing else to talk about,

553
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,640
 and is not someone you wanna spend

554
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,560
 the rest of your life with.

555
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,960
 That they're showing you the contents of their heart.

556
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,000
 Are they honest?

557
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,920
 Are they truthful?

558
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,040
 Girls, be honest, okay?

559
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,000
 Like, I'm gonna ask you a question,

560
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,740
 I want you all to shout no, okay, ready?

561
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,920
 Would you like to go have coffee with me?

562
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,840
 Okay, let's do it real loud, like heartfelt, ready?

563
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,280
 One more time.

564
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,120
 Excuse me, beautiful.

565
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,960
 Say, girl.

566
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,240
 ♪ The very first time ♪

567
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,880
 Hey, come here, baby, come here.

568
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 Hey, would you like to have coffee with me?

569
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,880
 That's right, you see how that works?

570
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,800
 It's okay, why?

571
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's a good reason.

572
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,480
 (congregation laughing)

573
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,040
 Yeah, that's a good reason.

574
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,760
 Here's the deal, no, why?

575
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,520
 I'm not feeling that, I'm not attracted to you,

576
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,680
 your breath stinks, I don't like that shirt,

577
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
 you need to comb your hair, you need to grow up,

578
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,160
 you're not very godly, I don't know why,

579
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
 whatever the reason is, but it's not

580
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,680
 because you gotta change your sock drawer, okay?

581
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
 So help him along.

582
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,640
 If there's a reason that he doesn't want,

583
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,800
 like you don't wanna be on a date with him, right?

584
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
 Let him know so that he, you know, somebody else,

585
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,320
 maybe he has something he can change,

586
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
 something within his power,

587
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
 or you're just not feeling that,

588
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,960
 but I feel like, ladies, like you feel like

589
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,680
 all of your authority and power has been taken away,

590
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,320
 and you've taken this word to submit,

591
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,480
 which is in the Bible, and I get it,

592
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,180
 but you think that now that means you can't be honest.

593
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,760
 And I want you to know you can be honest.

594
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,480
 You don't have to be hurtful, so don't hear me say that,

595
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,480
 okay, you don't have to be hurtful.

596
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,440
 Guys are like, yes, you don't have to be hurtful.

597
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,840
 (congregation laughing)

598
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,720
 But you can be honest, you know, and you can be confident,

599
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,600
 and you can look 'em in the eyes with dignity

600
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,320
 and just say, hey, that's not where I'm at right now.

601
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,600
 You know, or, you know, don't say I'm not open

602
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,000
 to dating if you are, 'cause I'm not,

603
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,120
 I don't wanna do that.

604
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,940
 Just whatever honesty is, that's what you can say, okay?

605
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,560
 There's nowhere in the scripture, I searched for it,

606
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,920
 there's no allotment in here to be anything

607
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,800
 less than honest, okay?

608
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,640
 I know that's crazy, it's like, what does he say

609
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,960
 to be honest, I don't, that's crazy.

610
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,600
 No, it's not, it's just biblical.

611
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
 It's just from the scripture.

612
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,760
 Guys, be intentional, amen?

613
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,480
 It was a weak amen.

614
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,360
 Well, here's what that means, okay?

615
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 It means, it may be obvious to you where you're at.

616
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,200
 Like, you may be there on a date, you know,

617
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,800
 at Chewy's or whatever, but she may not know that.

618
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,240
 And so, all you gotta do is just kinda talk

619
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
 about where you're at, hey, it's good to be here

620
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,060
 with you on a date, you know?

621
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,280
 (congregation laughing)

622
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,520
 You feel that?

623
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
 'Cause she's like, wait, is he, am I a friend,

624
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,760
 am I in the friend zone, or what's going on?

625
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
 Is this like, you're on a date, like,

626
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,440
 with your sister on a date, or?

627
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,360
 You know, and so, it's good to be here with you

628
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,280
 on a date at Chewy's, you know, and here we are,

629
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,200
 you order the enchiladas, I got the quesadillas.

630
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,440
 Great to be here with you on a date, you know?

631
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,480
 (congregation laughing)

632
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,880
 And see, 'cause some of us, we're doing this thing

633
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,580
 we like to call affectionately here, friendationships.

634
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,620
 You know, and here's what that is.

635
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,200
 That's where you get all of the affirmation

636
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
 from the opposite sex that you need through a friendship.

637
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,200
 And that's foolish.

638
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 And it's not God-honoring.

639
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,140
 And it's hurtful.

640
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,360
 Because what you're doing, you're thinking,

641
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,880
 hey, well, she's just a friend,

642
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,400
 she knows she's just a friend.

643
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,640
 He knows he's just a friend,

644
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,960
 I don't mean just to pick on the guys.

645
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,680
 He knows he's just a friend, and he doesn't.

646
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,920
 His heart's done drifted.

647
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,000
 So you just, hey, this is where we're at,

648
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,760
 this is what I'm doing, this is where I'm headed,

649
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,720
 I'm just being intentional, not intense, but intentional.

650
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,080
 This is what's going on, I want you to know.

651
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,400
 Hey, this is where I see this going,

652
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,960
 this is the destination I have in mind.

653
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,800
 This is where this isn't going, I gotta tell you,

654
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,120
 this is where it stops.

655
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,160
 Whatever that is, you guys can be honest with one another.

656
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,040
 As you love each other, you're brothers and sisters

657
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,000
 in Christ, you can be honest with each other.

658
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,680
 What that means is no games, okay?

659
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,520
 We drop games in the sixth grade, Romans 12, nine says,

660
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
 love must be sincere.

661
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,500
 What do I mean by games?

662
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,360
 Games are where you say or do something,

663
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,260
 hoping to get something in particular in response.

664
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,800
 If someone's playing games with you,

665
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,400
 that's because they haven't outgrown that,

666
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
 and they're probably not gonna make a good wife

667
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,200
 or a husband, okay?

668
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,040
 What is a game?

669
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,480
 A game is like when you hung up on somebody

670
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,000
 in the fifth grade, hoping they'd call you back,

671
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 that's a game, we don't play games.

672
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,720
 Love must be sincere, we're honest,

673
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,640
 we're just, everything that comes out of here

674
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,520
 is evidence of here, and that's just absolute truth.

675
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,600
 That's what I teach my little girls,

676
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
 just speak with absolute truth.

677
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,120
 Whatever the truth is, the truth is always good enough.

678
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,680
 The only reason to lie is because you think

679
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
 the truth isn't good enough,

680
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,560
 and the truth is always good enough.

681
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
 And so you can ask this question,

682
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,960
 how do they talk to you, do they build you up?

683
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,000
 Ephesians 4, 29 says, do not let any unwholesome talk

684
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
 come out of your mouth, but only what is helpful

685
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,000
 for building others up according to their needs,

686
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,720
 that it may benefit those who listen.

687
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,600
 Do they benefit you?

688
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,960
 This is, whenever we, as our porch volunteers,

689
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,840
 go somewhere, and so every now and then we'll do a retreat

690
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,080
 at a lake house or something, or we'll go somewhere,

691
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,760
 and what we always start with is, as I just said,

692
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,040
 hey, we wanna leave this place better than we found it.

693
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,960
 And so what that means is, we wanna leave it cleaner

694
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,680
 than we found it, everything in its place,

695
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,760
 and we want to leave it better than we found it.

696
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,240
 That's how you date, when you date someone,

697
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,840
 you want to leave them better than you found them, okay?

698
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,160
 Like if they go off to marry someone else,

699
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,320
 then that person who they marry is gonna be glad

700
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,720
 that they dated you, how novel of an idea is that?

701
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,840
 That's revolutionary, okay?

702
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,240
 Let me say it again, in case you missed it,

703
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,720
 you might have fell asleep, okay?

704
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
 If you date someone, leave them better than you found them.

705
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,480
 Don't give them a bunch of baggage,

706
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,360
 because they were around you, like here, hold my baggage,

707
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,600
 you know, and okay, peace out.

708
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,040
 No, leave them better than you found them.

709
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,960
 Leave them more like Jesus than when you met them, okay?

710
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,780
 My friend said this this week, she just,

711
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,960
 she wrote this to me in an email,

712
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,200
 this is a girl I'm in community with,

713
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,560
 she's married to my friend Marshall,

714
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
 and she just says this, "I always told myself

715
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,600
 "that if Marshall weren't to be my husband,

716
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,240
 "then I pray that I wanted to help him

717
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,360
 "become more like Christ, more ready for his bride

718
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,680
 "than before meeting me.

719
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,980
 "I didn't want to be on the list of the baggage

720
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,000
 "he would take with him into another relationship."

721
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,960
 I just read that, I'm like, how true is that?

722
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,340
 That you would date someone in the way

723
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,800
 that you would treat them, and build them up,

724
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,400
 and point them to Jesus, would leave them better

725
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
 than you found them, I know that's really counterintuitive

726
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
 in Dallas, but I promise.

727
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,320
 That's right.

728
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,680
 Check out their focus, so number one,

729
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,820
 check out their speech, two, what are they focused on?

730
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,360
 What is their life looking at, okay?

731
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,960
 What are they feeding their hearts with?

732
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,160
 This is important, oh, that's a nice effect.

733
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,120
 I thought, it's the rapture for a minute.

734
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,680
 (congregation laughing)

735
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,360
 What are they feeding their hearts?

736
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,920
 Okay, this goes back to the whole tabloid

737
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,800
 kind of gossip thing, all of that stuff,

738
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,840
 like I'll just tell you this, I told you I like Netflix.

739
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,040
 I was watching this show, somebody recommended it,

740
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,140
 and I started watching Breaking Bad, and,

741
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,760
 hold the applause. (congregation laughing)

742
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,200
 I knew that was gonna happen.

743
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,920
 So I started watching Breaking Bad,

744
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,600
 and I realized, after a couple episodes,

745
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,960
 I realized it wasn't good for me.

746
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,760
 Oh. (congregation laughing)

747
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,400
 It just did something, it did something to me,

748
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,600
 and maybe not you, maybe you're more spiritually mature

749
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,320
 than I am, or something, but where I was at,

750
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,680
 it just wasn't good for me.

751
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,600
 I kinda started walking around, like, feeling prideful,

752
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,840
 and I started thinking about words

753
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,160
 I don't usually think about in my vocabulary,

754
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,240
 you know, and I just kinda started feeling

755
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,920
 just a little puffed out, and at the same time,

756
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,800
 a little dark, like, there's just kind of a dark cloud,

757
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
 it's a dark show, there's kind of a dark cloud

758
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,880
 over my heart, and I just realized it wasn't good for me.

759
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,160
 I was taking in some stuff that was making my heart dirty.

760
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,040
 And so you need to look at, hey, what are they focusing on?

761
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,200
 What are they looking at, you know?

762
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,520
 This is gonna cover things like pornography, certainly.

763
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Like, if they're ingesting pornography,

764
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,320
 like, if that's you, like, I know that's a lot of you, man,

765
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,600
 you guys know, like, a lot of you are here

766
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,120
 for the first time, like, that's a huge part of my story.

767
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,200
 I was a major porn addict.

768
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,400
 I mean, it took years, frankly, of recovery,

769
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,200
 which every day I hoped it would be,

770
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,680
 today would be the day I'd never look at it again, you know?

771
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,000
 And like a dog to his vomit.

772
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,680
 And so here's what I want you to know, man,

773
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,840
 if you're here, and you looked at porn this month,

774
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,240
 like, that's a part of your life,

775
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,200
 and I know, ladies, it's one in three of you,

776
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,160
 I know that.

777
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,280
 If that's a part of your life, get help.

778
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,000
 Like, raise your hand, not now, but later, raise your hand,

779
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,440
 and say, hey, I need help, and we're here to help you.

780
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,840
 We want to, okay?

781
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,720
 We got this incredible thing called regeneration,

782
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,440
 incredible things called community groups,

783
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,920
 great pastors who would love to help you

784
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,440
 through that struggle, but you need to get help.

785
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,080
 Okay, but before you pull someone into that struggle,

786
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,800
 you need to heal from that struggle.

787
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,920
 What are they looking at, right?

788
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,920
 What are they looking at?

789
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,280
 Pinterest, I said earlier, you know?

790
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,760
 It's funny, the scripture says,

791
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,840
 gaze directly before you.

792
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,360
 See, I think some of us, like, our problem is,

793
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,760
 we're idolizing 10 years ahead,

794
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,280
 the white picket fence, and the husband

795
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,680
 who just got home from his firm,

796
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,440
 and you know, the cars, and the dog,

797
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,120
 and some of you are just like, man,

798
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,320
 I just want him breathing, that's all.

799
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,400
 If he'd just be breathing, that'd be fine, you know?

800
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,000
 And I'm just telling you, like, stop.

801
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,600
 Look right ahead of you, where am I at?

802
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,440
 Where do I want to be?

803
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,360
 What's the next step?

804
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,960
 That's the question, what's the next step I can take?

805
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,880
 I know ladies, I know some of you feel really helpless.

806
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,160
 I want to help you.

807
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,560
 We, our staff, our team, our volunteers,

808
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,880
 we want to help you.

809
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,480
 Hopefully you're gonna leave with something tonight.

810
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,760
 Meaning wisdom, not necessarily a person.

811
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,160
 (congregation laughing)

812
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,800
 You know, what's their focus on, intimacy?

813
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,680
 I know that's, like, some of us, that's the destination.

814
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,040
 Like, the desired destination.

815
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,760
 I mean, some of us here tonight.

816
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,480
 The desired destination is not

817
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,880
 a healthy, God-honoring marriage.

818
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,240
 Like, the desired destination is intimacy tonight.

819
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
 And you're really gonna hurt somebody.

820
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,720
 Like, one day, you're gonna look in that rearview mirror,

821
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,000
 and you're just gonna see cars piled up on the road,

822
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,840
 and you're gonna realize that it's been your bad driving

823
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,240
 that's responsible for all that damage.

824
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,120
 And before you do that, like, as someone who,

825
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
 that's a part of my story, I just want to say,

826
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,080
 hey, get help now.

827
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,400
 Just say, hey, man, I really, like, I don't know,

828
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,360
 I think I love God, but at the same time,

829
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,120
 I really love doing this stuff over here, and I need help.

830
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,360
 Okay, I need help.

831
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,680
 And so, come up and talk to me.

832
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,920
 You don't have to email, just come up tonight,

833
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,920
 or tomorrow, or next Tuesday, or whatever.

834
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,800
 Just come up and talk to us.

835
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,200
 And say, hey, we need help in that way, okay?

836
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,720
 And so, some of you, you're here tonight,

837
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,320
 and you feel like there's no hope for you

838
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,000
 because you know that that's a part of your story.

839
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,920
 You're like, man, pornography, check.

840
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,760
 Sex and intimacy, check.

841
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,680
 What's my hope?

842
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
 You know when you go on your GPS,

843
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
 and you start inputting an address,

844
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,360
 and it tells you everywhere you've been,

845
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,600
 like, it has the whole history there?

846
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,920
 You know, your heart's kind of the same way.

847
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,440
 Like, it shows you all these, like, you know,

848
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,600
 it reminds you, you reflect back.

849
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,720
 Maybe you're trying to, a quiet time,

850
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,400
 or be with God, or something, and you just start

851
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,040
 thinking about all of this stupid stuff you've done.

852
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,880
 But let me tell you something.

853
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,080
 You know how GPS, how it works?

854
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,720
 When you start entering new addresses,

855
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,360
 you know, you start saying, hey, this is where I'm going,

856
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 this is where I'm going, and all of a sudden,

857
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,440
 those old addresses, they go out of the system.

858
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,280
 Your heart works similarly.

859
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,360
 When you start going to new, healthy places,

860
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,400
 you start putting new truth in.

861
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,360
 Some of that old junk, right, goes away.

862
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,840
 I'm not saying you never did those things.

863
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,400
 You don't have to act like you didn't.

864
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,520
 Okay, but you say, hey, I'm a new creation.

865
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,600
 Jesus gave me a new heart.

866
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,440
 God gave me a new heart.

867
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,800
 That's not who I am.

868
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,640
 That's who I was.

869
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,160
 That's not who I am.

870
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,200
 Hey, guys, look, it's not who I am.

871
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,440
 It's who I was.

872
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
 It's not who I am.

873
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,840
 Okay, you can say that.

874
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,080
 You start going to those new destinations,

875
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,960
 and so that's the third thing you watch, okay?

876
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,940
 Number one, their speech.

877
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,660
 Number two, their focus.

878
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,860
 And number three, where they go,

879
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,260
 straight from the scripture.

880
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,920
 Where do they go?

881
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,440
 Literally, like, where do they hang out with?

882
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,160
 Who do they hang out with?

883
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,640
 Okay, where do they spend money?

884
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
 That's gonna show you what they're interested in.

885
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,280
 Let me just say it, like, plain as day,

886
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,620
 like, just pure logic.

887
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,680
 If they party like the world,

888
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,040
 it's 'cause they're worldly, you know?

889
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,940
 If they go to worldly places,

890
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,700
 it's probably 'cause they're worldly, not godly.

891
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,200
 So just be aware, like, hey,

892
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,880
 where are the places that they go?

893
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,240
 You know, who are they hanging out with?

894
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,040
 If they're hanging out with a bunch of sinners,

895
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,480
 and they're not Jesus, right?

896
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,500
 You know, maybe, right?

897
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,480
 Maybe that's their ministry,

898
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,960
 and so don't email me on that.

899
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,520
 If that's their ministry, great, I trust you.

900
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,740
 But be wise.

901
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,240
 Who are they hanging out with?

902
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,000
 I realize we're all hanging out with sinners,

903
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,720
 'cause we're all sinners.

904
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,560
 I know that.

905
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,620
 And so, here's the deal, we're all headed the same way.

906
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,000
 If you're here, let me say it like this,

907
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,820
 if you're here, and you've trusted in Christ

908
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,500
 for the forgiveness of sins,

909
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,700
 you're going the same direction.

910
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,300
 We're all headed to be with God forever and ever and ever.

911
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,020
 And I know these, like, few years you're not married,

912
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,360
 or these few years you want something,

913
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,200
 or these few years you're really struggling through purity,

914
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,800
 and it's a battle every night, it's a battle.

915
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,740
 Like, one day you're gonna be with God

916
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,900
 forever and ever and ever.

917
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,080
 Like, forever and ever and ever, man.

918
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,100
 Forever and ever, to the power of infinity,

919
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,180
 it's gonna be incredible.

920
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,980
 Like, God's gonna be there, and Father, Son, and Spirit's

921
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,100
 gonna be there, and your great-grandma's gonna be there,

922
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,520
 and that neighbor who loved Jesus is gonna be there,

923
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,740
 and some of your community group,

924
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,660
 and you're all gonna be there forever and ever and ever,

925
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,840
 and these light and momentary afflictions, they're right.

926
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,780
 Right, it's gonna fade away, so focus on that,

927
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,140
 knowing the destination where you're going.

928
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,480
 So let me just say, the last point tonight is just

929
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,140
 stay moving towards your destination.

930
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,380
 Stay moving towards your destination, continue.

931
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,220
 Right, it's where am I, where do I wanna be,

932
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,760
 what's the next step, okay?

933
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,520
 What's the next step, what's the sure footing

934
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,680
 the scripture says?

935
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,840
 And so here's what I want you to know,

936
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,240
 a lot of rules to dating, there's not a lot of rules

937
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,800
 to dating, love God with all your heart, soul,

938
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,380
 mind, and strength, and then date however you want.

939
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380
 You hear me?

940
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,760
 If God is ultimate in your life, like if he is

941
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,480
 the ultimate destination, and you know if he's not,

942
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,200
 I don't know, but you know if he's not.

943
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
 If you woke up this morning, you're like,

944
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,120
 Jesus, I just wanna be with you, I can't wait

945
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,560
 to open your word and just walk with you,

946
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,960
 and I want intimacy with you, and you are ultimate.

947
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,720
 Hey, keep me away from the temptations of this world,

948
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,520
 but I wanna walk with you, and it's not,

949
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,360
 it was like today and yesterday, and I'm not talking

950
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,280
 about like these momentary slumps we feel in,

951
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,160
 you know, I'm talking about I love God with my whole life.

952
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,280
 I don't wanna do that, I wanna love God.

953
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,080
 That's where you're at.

954
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,840
 Then stay there and date however you want.

955
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,720
 People ask questions like, well what about

956
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,280
 online dating, or can a girl pursue a guy,

957
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,120
 and this, I don't know, man.

958
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,440
 Doesn't say a lot about that.

959
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,720
 Like honestly, in here, there's just not a lot

960
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,800
 about dating.

961
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,440
 Like there's a little bit about marriage,

962
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,080
 but it's not about dating, it's about another relationship

963
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,080
 that's ultimate, you're gonna be with him forever

964
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,920
 and ever and ever.

965
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,160
 That's what's ultimate, and so if you make that ultimate,

966
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,560
 then date however you please.

967
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,680
 I got no fear.

968
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,400
 But if it's not ultimate,

969
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,920
 then maybe even before you date,

970
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,640
 before you consider dating, you think about,

971
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,800
 hey, how do I make that ultimate?

972
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,440
 Like I wanna change my life, JP.

973
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,840
 God, I wanna change my life.

974
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,560
 I'm tired of this reckless driving,

975
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,960
 I'm tired of beating my head against guardrails.

976
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,560
 I'm tired of getting these dents in my ride.

977
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,960
 I wanna drive straight, I want to go to him.

978
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,600
 I'm tired of dating these fools, these guys that hurt me.

979
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,260
 I hate that that girl who's no good for me has my heart.

980
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:54,860
 God, I wanna be right with you, okay?

981
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,740
 It's not a bunch of rules.

982
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,940
 You don't follow your heart, you inform your heart,

983
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,860
 and you tell it where it needs to go.

984
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:11,020
 Is there some principles that you should listen to?

985
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,940
 Yeah, but to be really honest with you,

986
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,180
 it's like when you're going to driver's ed,

987
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,780
 and you're there with the teacher,

988
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,180
 and they got that steering wheel on their side too

989
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,540
 'cause they don't trust you in those brakes,

990
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,500
 'cause they don't trust you,

991
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,620
 and you're sitting there and you're thinking through,

992
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,420
 and there's some rules, like there's some,

993
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,780
 go 35, like some laws, right, go 35 miles an hour here.

994
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,980
 Why, because there's some idiots

995
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,340
 that would drive 100 miles an hour

996
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,660
 through a school zone with kids, right?

997
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,360
 And so there has to be laws to protect some folks, right?

998
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,060
 But the reality of it, she's never sitting there,

999
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,220
 and as she's going through the things

1000
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,740
 that you need to attend into, you know,

1001
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,100
 and look ahead of you, she's never saying,

1002
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,700
 hey, and by the way, there's some trees

1003
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,620
 on the side of the road, don't hit those, okay?

1004
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,380
 Right, because everybody's like, yeah, of course,

1005
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,620
 she's like, whenever you're driving straight,

1006
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,380
 whatever you do, don't jerk the wheel into an oak tree.

1007
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,660
 You're like, yeah, why would I do that?

1008
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,260
 That's kind of the same things to dating.

1009
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,860
 Like there's like these big principles

1010
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,280
 that are a little obvious.

1011
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,140
 Hey, don't do that.

1012
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,080
 If you don't do that, you're gonna be fine.

1013
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,100
 I'll give 'em to you real quick, I know we're over,

1014
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,020
 I'll give 'em to you real fast, okay?

1015
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,900
 And so one, be honest and intentional, I said that.

1016
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,380
 Be honest with yourself, like where are you at, right?

1017
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,100
 Like what's going on?

1018
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,620
 You know, if you want a 23-year-old supermodel

1019
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,780
 who reads Greek and serves the poor and loves football,

1020
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,820
 you know, make sure that you're looking in the mirror

1021
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,220
 and you know where you're at.

1022
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,900
 (congregation laughing)

1023
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,820
 Be honest, be honest with yourself.

1024
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,740
 Don't look at anyone not actively pursuing Christ, okay?

1025
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,140
 That's the wrong way!

1026
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,940
 Don't look at anyone not actively running hard after Jesus.

1027
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,980
 It's 2 Corinthians 6, 14.

1028
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,860
 Do not be unequally yoked with nonbelievers.

1029
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,080
 What do light and darkness have in common?

1030
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,300
 That's a loving God trying to save you some grief, man.

1031
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,300
 He is trying to help you.

1032
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
 For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common,

1033
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,620
 or what fellowship can light have with darkness?

1034
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,020
 Pursue absolute purity.

1035
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,200
 Don't hit that tree!

1036
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,800
 Of course, pursue, I'm not married, of course.

1037
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,420
 Pursue purity, of course.

1038
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,540
 You know, what can I, no!

1039
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,260
 Get married!

1040
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,100
 Okay, what about this?

1041
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,340
 Is this, how far is too far?

1042
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,020
 Don't, put a ring on the finger, that's not too far, okay?

1043
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,540
 Do that!

1044
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,340
 Find someone who loves Jesus and marry them.

1045
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,220
 That's what's frustrating about this talk,

1046
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,180
 is there's people that are like,

1047
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,700
 hey, what are the tips and tricks, you know?

1048
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,500
 I wanna know how to date, and really,

1049
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,340
 what you need to hear is like,

1050
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,140
 man, you're just not in a place where you should.

1051
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,420
 And then there's folks that are like,

1052
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,300
 man, I've heard the tips and tricks and the talks,

1053
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,420
 and I've listened to so many dating talks,

1054
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,540
 and what you need to hear is get married!

1055
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,980
 It's time, if that's what you want, go!

1056
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,500
 Find someone who loves Jesus, and you're like,

1057
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,380
 JP, but I'm a girl and I'm waiting for some guy,

1058
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,100
 you know, and I get that.

1059
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,900
 Guys, stop being idiots.

1060
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,420
 I love you, but man, it's game time.

1061
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,420
 Okay, I mean that in the most affectionate way, okay?

1062
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,460
 I mean that, 'cause I love you.

1063
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,900
 But I'm serious.

1064
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,180
 If you're a guy here and you love God

1065
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,860
 with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,

1066
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,820
 and you're running after Him,

1067
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,540
 look and find someone in this room

1068
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,360
 who loves God of the opposite sex

1069
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,740
 with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength,

1070
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,140
 and put a ring on it.

1071
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,180
 That's good advice, I promise.

1072
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,340
 You're like, no, that's bad advice.

1073
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,780
 It's not bad advice, okay?

1074
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:32,660
 It just says in 27, do not swerve to the right or the left,

1075
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,940
 but keep your foot from evil.

1076
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,860
 I mean, here's the deal, like I wrote that blog,

1077
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,580
 you know, 10 Things to Look For in a Guy,

1078
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,420
 10 Things to Look For in a Woman.

1079
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,500
 You can check that out on our website.

1080
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,020
 But I just said it, you know, number 10,

1081
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,060
 it's like, hey, if you get this,

1082
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,500
 then one through nine's taken care of.

1083
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,980
 And that's how I feel about dating.

1084
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,140
 Like, if they have that, if they have number 10,

1085
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,900
 like if they're pursuing Christ with their whole hearts

1086
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,080
 and their whole lives, like all that other stuff,

1087
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,920
 it's gonna be okay.

1088
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,660
 There is no compatibility among sinners.

1089
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,180
 That's us, you and me.

1090
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,980
 There's no such thing as compatibility among us.

1091
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,860
 There just isn't.

1092
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,500
 We're not compatible.

1093
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,540
 We're two selfish people coming together,

1094
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,740
 determined to be unselfish towards each other.

1095
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,780
 That's the reality, okay?

1096
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,180
 And so inform your heart with truth.

1097
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,540
 Consider who you are interested in

1098
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,540
 and keep moving towards your destination, right?

1099
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,580
 GPS, consider your GPS, right?

1100
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,540
 Tell it where to go.

1101
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
 The other day I was,

1102
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:33,260
 I was driving back from being at my parents over Christmas.

1103
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,520
 My parents live like six hours south of here.

1104
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,460
 And so six, like compute this for me.

1105
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,580
 Six hours in the car, three kids and my wife.

1106
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,100
 My wife, that's the good part, but three kids, you know.

1107
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,980
 One of those kids is a brand new one, a baby, infant.

1108
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,780
 He's there, and so six hours in the car with him.

1109
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,620
 And he's getting restless.

1110
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,300
 And really, at about this time,

1111
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,780
 so I'm pulling into Dallas,

1112
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,880
 and it was like the best thing ever

1113
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,900
 because everyone had fallen asleep.

1114
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,620
 And I got, for Christmas, I got these Beats, earphones.

1115
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,660
 And so I'm listening to Shane and Shane, actually,

1116
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,180
 and to an album I just downloaded,

1117
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,580
 and I'm just in there and I'm just worshiping.

1118
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,500
 Like, everybody's sleeping, and I'm just,

1119
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,820
 yeah, you know, I wanna yearn for you.

1120
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,140
 And I'm just worshiping.

1121
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,240
 And I'm pulling into Dallas after six hours.

1122
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,420
 Like, it's this beautiful glow of the Dallas skyline.

1123
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,300
 I see the ball, the Reunion Tower,

1124
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,540
 and I see the Bank of America building and the green neons.

1125
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,260
 I'm driving by that giant giraffe at the Dallas Zoo,

1126
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,100
 and I'm heading over.

1127
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,060
 And this is a drive, I've made this drive

1128
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,160
 hundreds of times, literally.

1129
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,460
 When I moved to Dallas, I dated Monica in Waco,

1130
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,020
 and so I made this drive so many times, hundreds of times.

1131
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,940
 And so here I am, I'm almost home, and I'm worshiping.

1132
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,860
 I got my earphones in, everybody's sleeping.

1133
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,940
 Like, it's the greatest thing ever.

1134
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,720
 And we haven't been home for a week now.

1135
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,940
 We had been gone.

1136
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,140
 And so I'm just like, yes.

1137
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,380
 And so I'm driving, and I'm worshiping,

1138
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,260
 and I'm driving, and I'm worshiping.

1139
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,180
 And I'm driving, and I'm driving, and I'm driving.

1140
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,980
 And I look up.

1141
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,980
 I'm like, Cabela's?

1142
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,380
 [LAUGHTER]

1143
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,980
 What?

1144
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,780
 I've never even seen that Cabela's before.

1145
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,020
 [LAUGHTER]

1146
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,220
 You know?

1147
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,420
 And I'm like, what just happened?

1148
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,060
 And I leave.

1149
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,580
 It says, you are now leaving Keller.

1150
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,300
 I'm like, Keller?

1151
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,060
 Where is Keller?

1152
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,340
 [LAUGHTER]

1153
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,420
 Is that in Texas?

1154
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,740
 You know?

1155
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,260
 And Monica wakes up, and she's like, what are you doing?

1156
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,660
 I'm like, go back to sleep, babe.

1157
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,740
 [LAUGHTER]

1158
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,740
 I'm like, did you know they put a Cabela's over here?

1159
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,300
 I just wanted to see if it was open.

1160
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,180
 It's closed.

1161
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,900
 But yeah.

1162
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,180
 And she's like, where are we?

1163
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,220
 I'm like, I don't know.

1164
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,100
 [LAUGHTER]

1165
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,940
 And I said, OK, I'm going to need your help.

1166
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,380
 She gets out her iPhone, put in her address, 7619.

1167
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,340
 And it's like, OK, an hour and 23 minutes from my house.

1168
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,700
 [LAUGHTER]

1169
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,420
 I know, I didn't tell the story up front.

1170
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,300
 I would have lost all credibility.

1171
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,060
 An hour and 23 minutes out of the way, I took us.

1172
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,660
 An hour and 23 minutes.

1173
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,260
 And I'm like, OK, but here's the deal.

1174
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,100
 OK, I'm done.

1175
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,740
 I'm done trying to feel this thing out.

1176
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,780
 Like, take me home.

1177
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,180
 I'm like, babe, you got it?

1178
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:22,900
 You got it?

1179
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,740
 We're ready?

1180
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,580
 Let's go.

1181
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,860
 And we're in that car together.

1182
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,540
 She's navigating.

1183
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,780
 She's listening to the GPS.

1184
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,980
 She's telling us where to go.

1185
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,580
 We're going to the same direction, the same destination.

1186
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,380
 We're driving the same pace, her and I. And we're going.

1187
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,420
 And we're both running towards home.

1188
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,100
 And that's you, right?

1189
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,020
 That's what you're doing, right?

1190
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,540
 You've got these stops along the way.

1191
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,940
 But if you're here, you've trusted in Christ.

1192
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,460
 You're running home.

1193
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,220
 You're going home.

1194
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,300
 Find someone going home with you.

1195
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,100
 Not tonight.

1196
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,540
 [LAUGHTER]

1197
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,380
 Find someone headed to that same destination,

1198
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,140
 like with all of them.

1199
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,420
 Not some of their life, not half their heart, but all of them.

1200
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,780
 Say, hey, man, let's navigate these waters together.

1201
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,220
 Let's go.

1202
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,660
 Let's rock.

1203
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,180
 Let me pray.

1204
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:33,460
 Father, the things I said that were not of you, erase them.

1205
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,980
 Please, God.

1206
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,180
 And Father, the things that I said that were consistent with

1207
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,500
 your spirit and your character and who you are, the exegesis

1208
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,140
 of your word and the truth from your scriptures made alive to

1209
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,540
 us by the power of your spirit.

1210
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,220
 Lord, I pray they would stir in our hearts and our minds,

1211
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,140
 Father, that we would know what they are, that we would

1212
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,780
 yield to them.

1213
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,860
 I know there's folks frustrated right now.

1214
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,740
 But he didn't address.

1215
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,820
 I know.

1216
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:04,260
 God, would you remind them of the truth they need to hear?

1217
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,180
 Would you, in your sovereignty, move in and fill

1218
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,620
 the voids that my teaching leaves?

1219
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,660
 Father, would you stir our hearts and our minds around the

1220
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,900
 truths we need to hear?

1221
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,020
 And God, would you make us new?

1222
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,580
 There's some folks tonight that just need to be made new.

1223
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,420
 Lord, thank you for the way you made me new and others in my

1224
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:27,940
 life new.

1225
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,740
 And I just pray you'd make them new, that your spirit would

1226
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,980
 make them new.

1227
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,460
 You remind them how much you love them through Christ.

1228
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,700
 We sing to you now.

1229
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,860
 Hope that I have for you is like, I don't care how far off

1230
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,700
 the path you are.

1231
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,660
 You can return to it right now.

1232
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:56,460
 Just go and say, God, conform this wretched device in me to

1233
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,340
 that of your son.

1234
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,620
 Give me a new one to pursue the things that you desire for me.

1235
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,940
 Because God, you're a holy and a good and amazing God.

1236
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,420
 And you desire good things for your children.

1237
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,340
 And so I pray that this thing in all of us would pursue the

1238
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,460
 things of you.

1239
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:22,580
 Help us, God, to reprogram our broken GPS devices.

1240
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,900
 Father, give us new ones that work.

1241
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,580
 Lord, help us to set the destination on you.

1242
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,300
 Amen.

1243
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,820
 I do.

1244
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,100
 I want you to leave it with that hope.

1245
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,860
 Wherever you're at, whatever you look behind you, there's

1246
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,620
 broken cars, and maybe you're just the person here that

1247
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,580
 knows that you want something that's not

1248
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,140
 available to you so bad.

1249
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,380
 Just go to that heart.

1250
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,340
 Say, God, would you reprogram it?

1251
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,860
 Father, would you give me a new one?

1252
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:54,780
 Would you set it on you and return to the path and walk one

1253
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,580
 foot in front of the other towards him?

1254
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,260
 OK.

1255
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,940
 If we can help you do that, we want to.

1256
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,420
 We have this deal tonight called Open Community Group.

1257
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,140
 And so if you're here and you're just like, man, I just

1258
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,740
 need some friends who are believers, OK?

1259
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,020
 And particularly--

1260
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,580
 yeah, I'll start there.

1261
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,180
 If you are looking for some friends who are believers,

1262
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,100
 it's a community, you're committed to that idea, or you

1263
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,420
 want to hear a vision on it, you want to hear what it is,

1264
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,740
 then guys, you can go to this room right here, right through

1265
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,060
 this door.

1266
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,340
 You can walk forward and then go through that room as soon

1267
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:31,180
 as we're done here.

1268
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,220
 And girls, you can go through that door right there, and

1269
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,580
 there's a glass room right there.

1270
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,420
 And this will be full of other girls who are saying, hey, I'm

1271
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,100
 looking for some friends, looking for community.

1272
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,580
 Some full of some guys over here, they're saying, hey, I'm

1273
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,740
 looking for some friends who are looking for community.

1274
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,540
 And our community team's going to be in there to talk with

1275
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,900
 you through that.

1276
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,060
 Also, if you have these questions, you're like, man,

1277
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,380
 he didn't cover my question.

1278
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,460
 One, we've got two weeks left.

1279
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,020
 Two, we have the Google+ Hangout tomorrow.

1280
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,180
 We're going to broadcast that on the internet.

1281
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,540
 And so I think it's at 9--

1282
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,700
 what time is it?

1283
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,740
 1130.

1284
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,380
 But then also, we're going to record it.

1285
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,540
 And so it will be online.

1286
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,980
 And so you can tweet your questions into us or put them

1287
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,140
 on Facebook, and we will do our best to cover those

1288
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,180
 questions in that interview tomorrow.

1289
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,140
 I love you guys.

1290
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,580
 I hope you know and understand that.

1291
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,060
 I hope more than that.

1292
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,860
 If you don't know that I love you, know that God does.

1293
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,900
 He's crazy about you, and he desires good things for you.

1294
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,660
 So go in peace to love and serve the Lord.

1295
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:34,060
