[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.240]   Hey, because the majority of those of you in the room
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.760]   are from outside, not just of Dallas, but Texas.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.600]   Welcome to Awaken and welcome to Texas.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.120]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.680]   It is gonna be an amazing next few days
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.320]   and we are so excited and been praying so much
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.800]   and we're gonna dive in and talk for the next few days
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.320]   about what it looks like to walk in the way of truth,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.960]   to be united and have hearts that are united together,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.280]   undivided hearts.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.280]   I'm gonna read the passage that we're gonna be in tonight
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.640]   as we open up the first topic.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.560]   And that's in 2 Timothy 3.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.360]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.160]   to 2 Timothy 3.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.960]   Some of the last words the apostle Paul would ever write.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.960]   If you don't have a Bible, it'll be up on the screens.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.440]   And I'm gonna start in verse 14.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.840]   Paul says, "But as for you,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.200]   continue in what you have learned
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.560]   and have firmly believed,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.840]   knowing from whom you learned it
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.480]   and how from childhood you have been acquainted
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.520]   with the sacred writings,
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.760]   which are able to make you wise for salvation
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.080]   through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080]   All scripture is breathed out by God
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.200]   and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.040]   for correction and for training in righteousness,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.640]   that the man of God may be complete,
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.560]   equipped for every good work.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.640]   I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280]   who is to judge the living and the dead
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.840]   by his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.160]   preach the word, be ready in season and out of season,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.160]   reprove, rebuke and exhort
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.120]   with complete patience and teaching.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.240]   For the time is coming when people
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.680]   will not endure sound teaching,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.760]   but having itching ears,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.320]   they will accumulate for themselves teachers
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.720]   to suit their own passions or desires
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.840]   and will turn away from listening to the truth
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.200]   and wander off into myths.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.120]   As for you, always be sober minded,
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.360]   endure suffering and do the work of an evangelist.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.560]   Fulfill your ministry."
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.400]   Let me pray one more time.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.880]   Father, thank you for your word.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.840]   Thank you that it is living and active and alive.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.200]   Thank you for every person that you've gathered here.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.680]   As we unpack the incredible truths that you preserved,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.360]   would you illuminate our minds
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.960]   to see the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.200]   and in beholding Jesus to be changed?
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.400]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.000]   Like I said, the theme for this weekend is undivided hearts.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.440]   And that comes from the verse that we just read.
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   I'm gonna read it one more time,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.360]   specifically verse 11 of Psalm 86.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.320]   "Teach me your way, O Lord,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.800]   that I would walk in your truth,
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.080]   unite my heart to fear your name."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.960]   And as we were praying and looking at this year,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.800]   it's been an unbelievably divisive year
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.080]   that we're all coming out of called 2020.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.600]   And the church is commanded over and over in scripture
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.480]   to be united together, to be united together as one.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.520]   So we're gonna walk through different topics
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.880]   that we are to have undivided hearts around,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.360]   that we are to be united together in.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.960]   And because we're talking about that,
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.040]   I thought I'd launch into tonight's conversation
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.200]   by bringing up one of the most divisive words
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.840]   in the past five years.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.680]   Ready for it?
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.600]   You missed it.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.720]   If you didn't hear it, you missed,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.120]   no, that's totally not true.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.280]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.120]   Did we have it?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.840]   And?
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.680]   Laurel.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.840]   Run it back.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.120]   I'll just do it, laurel.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.440]   That word was like five years old and it's distant,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.000]   but this week my family came across that word again
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.960]   somehow and I played it for my kids
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.160]   and I'm gonna show you the reaction
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.080]   that they've never heard it.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.240]   For you, it's old news, it happened five years ago,
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.400]   lit the internet on fire and everybody heard different things
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.240]   but here's the reaction that they had
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.040]   when they saw it this week and played.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.840]   And candidly, as their father, I was shocked.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   What kind of kids am I raising?
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.880]   Here's what happened.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.400]   All right, what does it sound like?
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.720]   - Laurel. - Yell.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.440]   - Yell? - Laurel.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.680]   - Yell.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.480]   - Laurel.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.160]   - What's that sound like?
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.480]   - Yell.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.440]   - One more?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   - Yeah, yell.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.800]   - Yell?
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.640]   - Laurel.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.800]   - What's it sound like?
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.640]   - Yell.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.520]   - So that was their first reaction.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.880]   And in this room, I think we can all agree,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.680]   let's say what the actual word is on three.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.080]   Ready, one, two, three.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.560]   - Laurel.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.960]   - Yeah, it's divided.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.200]   We are looking at the same thing
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.280]   and what we believe about what is true is divided.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   That's one of those situations
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.480]   where people can be looking at the same thing
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.160]   and when it comes to, hey, what's true, we're divided.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.960]   There is a way to find out what is actually true.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.800]   And it's not based on what you hear, what you think,
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.240]   what your opinion is.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.120]   There's a way to actually know, is it Yanny or is it Laurel?
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.960]   What is that way?
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.480]   You go to the creator of it to discover what is true.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.720]   And the creator actually came out and said,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.960]   "Hey, it was Laurel."
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.920]   And for whatever reason, just the Jedi mind trick
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.360]   that different people hear different things.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.720]   But in a similar way of how do I know what's true?
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.520]   It doesn't go based on what I think, what I feel,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.760]   my opinion.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.560]   I can go to the creator to discover what is true.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   Not of some tune or sound clip, but of our world, of life,
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.040]   of where life is found, of purpose,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.880]   of what is truth in general.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.320]   And as Christians, you and I are commanded,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.160]   tonight's topic is talking about being united in truth.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.760]   And truth being God's word.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.440]   And specifically, we're gonna cover three things
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.400]   from God's word we've got to be united in, unanimous about.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.280]   In other words, there's things in God's word
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.560]   where there could be different interpretations,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.400]   where people could disagree and still be united.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.140]   But the things we're gonna talk about tonight
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.560]   are three key imperatives for anyone following Jesus.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.040]   We have got, the church has to be united around
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.480]   and united in truth.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.240]   Tonight's topic is a topic that sadly,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.360]   because Christians have not been united
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.520]   in believing these things,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.160]   or people who claim to be Christians
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.740]   have not been united around these beliefs,
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.400]   have seen the church be ineffective, unloving,
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.480]   and not what Christ calls them to be.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.440]   There are three things that,
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.120]   depending on whether you embrace them or not,
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.620]   are gonna play a huge, pivotal role
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.600]   in whatever the future of your life holds.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.500]   So I'm gonna walk through and we're gonna unpack
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.560]   what is kind of the main point,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.520]   what does the Bible point us to,
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.760]   what it tells us or how it instructs us,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.640]   and how we are to represent it.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.560]   I'm gonna start in verse 14.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.040]   And before I do, let me set up a little bit,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.180]   as I said, this was written by Paul.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.240]   So the Apostle Paul was the apostle formerly known as Saul,
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.100]   spent half his life trying to kill Christianity,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.520]   trying to stop out Christianity,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.880]   gets saved and becomes the greatest missionary
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.200]   arguably the world has ever seen.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.480]   God uses him to write more of the New Testament
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.880]   than anybody else.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.320]   And he wrote incredible letters and he sits down
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.080]   and this would be the final letter he would ever write.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   In other words, the most influential missionary
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.800]   or Christian evangelist of all time
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.720]   wrote all these different letters
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.960]   and we're about to read not just the last letter,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.140]   but part of the last chapter he would ever write.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.920]   At the time, he's sitting in a cold dungeon cell
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.000]   awaiting his death.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.520]   Many scholars believe he's months, if not weeks,
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.960]   away from being let out into a courtyard
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.240]   and being beheaded, which is how history tells us Paul died.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.640]   And he sits down and he writes these words
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.200]   and they're to a very particular person.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.320]   He writes to Timothy.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.680]   If you know anything about Timothy,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.800]   the relationship Paul had with Timothy
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.400]   was an incredibly deep one.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.200]   All throughout the New Testament, Paul will reference him
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.040]   and at one point he says,
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.200]   "There's no one like Timothy in my life.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.480]   I have no one else like him."
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.120]   He was Batman and Timothy would have been his Robin.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   Timothy would travel with him,
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.640]   would have helped write letters with him,
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.720]   go Batman and Robin.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.600]   Timothy was the protege of Paul.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.760]   And Paul sitting in this prison writes to Timothy
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.840]   who is leading a church in Ephesus.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.000]   He's leading a ministry.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.680]   And Paul begins to talk about the importance of this book
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.040]   to Timothy, to the future of the church, to you and I.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.120]   And he brings up some really key things
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.960]   that a lot of Christians don't either understand
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.860]   or have never even been taught about what this contains
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.340]   and why it's so significant to the church.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.620]   So in verse 14, he says this,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.840]   "But as for you, continue in what you have learned
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.040]   and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it."
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.760]   We're told in chapter one, it was his mom,
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.520]   he had a godly mom and a godly grandmother
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.880]   that taught him the scriptures.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.200]   "And how from childhood you have been acquainted
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.760]   with the sacred writings."
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.600]   I'm gonna come back to that in a second,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.660]   'cause it's a really important word.
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.480]   "Which are able to make you wise for salvation
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.680]   through faith in Christ Jesus."
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.760]   For salvation, the sacred writings,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.920]   for salvation through faith in Jesus.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.060]   For salvation through Jesus.
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.600]   Now, why do I say sacred writings
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.460]   is a really important word to understand.
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.440]   What I think is one of Paul's
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.460]   most significant verses he writes.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.840]   He says, "The sacred writings that are able to make you wise
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.280]   for salvation through Jesus."
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.080]   Well, when Paul wrote the word sacred writings,
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.520]   he would eventually be talking about the New Testament,
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.600]   but at this time, if you know your history,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.440]   the New Testament wasn't around,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.480]   or wasn't completely compiled.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.500]   The term sacred writings was even a Hebrew term
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.780]   for the Old Testament.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.520]   That Paul brings up the Old Testament, and he says,
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.120]   "Hey, you know what the Old Testament makes sure
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.540]   that you hold onto those truths
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.120]   that are for salvation through Jesus."
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.280]   When he brings up the sacred writings,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.560]   the Old Testament is for salvation through Jesus.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.320]   That Paul, translation would say,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.440]   "The Old Testament, all of the Bible,
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.360]   and especially at this time, the Old Testament,
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.960]   all of it is about Jesus."
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.880]   The focal point and the main character
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.600]   of the Bible is Jesus, and that's really important.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.780]   I'm about to unpack why.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.880]   Understanding that when you and I approach the Bible
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.800]   is key to how we take, because what we believe about it
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.560]   will determine what we receive from it.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.480]   And Paul's gonna say, "Hey, the whole thing
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.200]   has been about Jesus."
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.800]   The main character, or the main idea,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.640]   is not a bunch of principles or self-help rules.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.120]   It is about a person whose name is Jesus.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.040]   All throughout the Old Testament,
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.020]   we discover it's all been pointing to him.
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.120]   Jesus, in John chapter five, would even say this
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.660]   to a group of Pharisees who were a religious group
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.400]   of leaders who were so studied in the Old Testament.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.160]   They had the first five books of the Torah memorized.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.620]   And Jesus says this to them.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.840]   "You search the scriptures because you think
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.680]   they give you eternal life, but the scriptures point to me.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.460]   Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life."
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.460]   Jesus would say, "The Bible is not about principles.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.360]   The Bible is not even about the Bible.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.540]   The Bible is about Jesus."
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.100]   And any understanding that you and I have,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.700]   first and foremost, has to be that all throughout
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.460]   the Bible, it is pointing me to Jesus,
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.780]   not to a bunch of rules, not to a bunch of principles,
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.780]   primarily to the person of Jesus.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.940]   And another occasion, Jesus is walking along the road
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.980]   in Luke chapter 24, and he brings up this exact idea again,
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.700]   where he says, "Was it not necessary that the Christ
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.220]   would suffer these things and enter into glory?"
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.380]   And beginning, talking about Jesus,
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.340]   "With Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted them
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.580]   in all the scriptures, the things concerning himself."
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.300]   That you and I are to come to God's word
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.020]   with the understanding it is, first and foremost,
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.420]   it's not about you, it's not about rules,
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.800]   it is about Jesus.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.120]   And pointing humanity to their savior,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.080]   the one who would come to die for their sins.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.840]   Even the foreshadowing of the stories,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.960]   these incredible stories are not just about good men,
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.600]   and let's have some takeaways from them.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.320]   These men's stories are types of pointing,
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.440]   are types of Christ that point to Jesus.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.280]   What do I mean by that?
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.320]   Moses, the guy who would go and lead God's people
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.680]   out of Egypt, leading them out of slavery and bondage
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.040]   into a promised land of rest.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.920]   Just like Jesus, who would lead God's people
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.880]   out of slavery to sin, into eternal life,
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.840]   or God's promised destination.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.040]   Noah, God told Noah, "Go build a boat, it's gonna rain,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   it's gonna be really, really rainy for the next 40 days.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.880]   Build a boat."
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.080]   Noah goes, builds a boat.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.680]   Every person who trusted in that piece of wood,
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.500]   called an ark, that was lifted up as the waters poured in,
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.420]   was saved.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.560]   Just like Jesus, and every person who trusts
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.720]   in that piece of wood that our Savior was crucified onto,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.040]   that was lifted up, will be saved.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.120]   Abraham, Abraham was called by God,
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.640]   "Hey, I want you to go and sacrifice your son."
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.580]   It says, "Your one and only son."
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.700]   Moments before he's about to kill his son Isaac,
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.120]   God shows up and says, "Don't kill your son,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.560]   because I'm gonna kill mine."
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.160]   And Jesus, in John chapter eight, would say,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.280]   "Abraham," and if you know the story,
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.200]   there's this moment, he's looking,
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.720]   he's about to kill his son, and all of a sudden,
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.080]   a voice says, "Don't kill your son."
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.240]   And he looks up and there's a ram.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.160]   God provided another sacrifice.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.000]   And Jesus, in John chapter eight, said,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   "Abraham looked and saw my day coming, and rejoiced."
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.720]   Over and over, the story of David and Goliath.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.480]   The David goes, kills the giant of Goliath,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.880]   just like Jesus would come, and he would kill the giant,
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.480]   not of Goliath, but of sin and death.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.600]   And what did he do it with?
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.840]   Five smooth stones.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.680]   Think about this.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.920]   He only uses one.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.700]   Why are we told there's five?
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.880]   Well, in Hebrew, the Hebrew number five
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   is the number for grace.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.720]   Every page points to Jesus.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.400]   Jonah spent three days in the belly of a well,
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.720]   just like Jesus, spent three days in the belly of the earth,
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.160]   and Jesus walks through all of it.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.240]   It's all about me.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.480]   If Abraham was here, he would say, "It's all about him."
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.520]   If Moses was here, he'd say, "It's all about him."
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.640]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.980]   And understanding this is key, because here's what happens.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.240]   People come to the Bible and they make it a self-help book.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   You know what the focus of a self-help book is?
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.440]   Self.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.400]   The focus of the Bible is not you, it's Jesus.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.040]   And when you and I approach it and we go to read it,
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.560]   we read it, because if it's about Jesus,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.760]   here's what it is, it is a love letter.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.360]   Jesus is the full expression of God's love on the cross,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.520]   and we come and read it, and now we read every page,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.580]   not basking in condemnation, 'cause that's about you.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.360]   We read it going, man, this is who my God is.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.720]   This is who my God is.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.240]   This is what my God has done.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.920]   This is where life is found through Jesus.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.860]   And Paul, remarkably and so incredibly,
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.360]   before there was any New Testament completed,
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.760]   said, "Hey, Timothy,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.600]   all of those Old Testament verses, they're all about Jesus.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.640]   Don't lose sight, don't lose hope, don't let go of that."
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.480]   The main character of the Bible
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.280]   is Jesus from beginning to end.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.440]   It's amazing how many Christians
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.840]   that will make the focal point something else.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.560]   They're familiar with the scripture,
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.000]   and maybe you were raised in church,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   you've been around it and you've seen it,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.920]   and you've never, but you missed the point.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.520]   It's right in front of your face all this time.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.440]   It's all about Him.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.120]   It's not dissimilar to this.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.280]   There was a logo I was looking at today
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:28.720]   that I'd never connected the dots before.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.040]   It's a logo I've seen every day,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.280]   last five years probably.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.900]   It's a logo that all of you have seen
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.080]   over and over and over again.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.000]   It's this logo right here.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.840]   It's Amazon.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:43.320]   Do you know that the arrow is there to communicate?
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.240]   We sell everything from A to Z.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.840]   Man, the emotional attachment to Amazon in this room
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.360]   is quite remarkable, honestly.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.480]   You look at that every single day,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.180]   you've never connected those dots.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.600]   And in a similar way, people will spend time in the Bible,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.520]   or they were raised in Sunday school, raised in the church,
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   and they were around it all the time,
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.280]   and they never connected the dots.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.920]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   And Paul says, first and foremost,
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.440]   before we get anything else, let's be very clear.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.680]   The main character is Him.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.760]   And then he goes into how it plays its role
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.840]   inside of our life, and who the author is,
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.920]   which informs how it plays that role.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.920]   He says this, "All Scripture is breathed out by God."
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.080]   Let me read that again.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.320]   A lot of us have heard that verse before,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.560]   but I wanna slowly think about what he's saying.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.360]   "Every word is breathed out by God,
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:47.300]   "and profitable for teaching, for reproof or correction,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.780]   "and for training in righteousness
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.260]   "that you and I may be equipped or complete
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.780]   "and equipped for every good work."
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.460]   I wanna unpack what Paul just said.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.220]   The second idea is the author of the Bible is God.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.820]   The main character is Jesus, the author is God,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.780]   which has some real significant implications.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.740]   And it tells us how to think about what we're reading here.
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.860]   The author being God, every word is inspired.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.980]   It's a word, we have no other record
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.620]   of this word being used.
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.140]   It was breathed out by God himself.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.820]   It's alive, if you will.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.340]   It was breathed out by God,
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.820]   inspired the words of God himself.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.060]   When Old Testament writers
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.200]   or New Testament writers were writing, they wrote it,
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.820]   but God was inspiring the words that would be recorded
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.140]   and would be written down.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.740]   This generation, more than any other generation,
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.460]   says something that I both love
[00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.620]   and also think they're not taking advantage
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.460]   of where they could.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.900]   In other words, for whatever reason,
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.060]   the last five years, language like,
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.620]   "Hey, I want a word, I wanna hear a word."
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.260]   Man, that's a word, that's a word right there.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.860]   "I wanna hear a word from God, I want a word from,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.100]   "man, I'm just looking for a word from God,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.140]   "looking for a word."
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.460]   That everyone is obsessed with,
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.260]   "Man, I wanna hear a word from God."
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.260]   And yet they don't open the word of God and read it.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.140]   And know, hey, and I'm not saying God can't speak,
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.980]   I'm saying he has spoken.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.580]   And he can speak in other ways beyond that,
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.420]   but he has very clearly spoken.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.060]   In fact, let me just press a little bit harder here
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.060]   'cause this is really important
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.100]   and it's thrown out, especially in dating world
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:18.940]   and young adult world.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.540]   What people will say, these two words, "God told me."
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:28.660]   Those are three of the most powerful words
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:29.660]   you could ever say.
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.860]   "God told me."
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.580]   If you hear that or that comes out of your mouth
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.760]   and what follows next is not,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.940]   "God told me," in Romans chapter 12, verse one.
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.780]   You should better have heard from God
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.940]   and it better align with his word
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.220]   or seen some sort of writing on the wall,
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.220]   or you are representing something
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.340]   that may or may not be what God told you,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.740]   especially if it contradicts what God says in God's word.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.100]   In other words, perhaps a better way to say it,
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.420]   even if you're like, "Man, I really think
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.960]   "this is what I'm supposed to do is,
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.660]   "I think God told me."
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.620]   I think, I mean, that's honestly what's most accurate.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.940]   You don't know, you're just going, "Hey."
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.900]   And often it's like, "Man, I was driving down the road
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.820]   "and God told me."
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.540]   And what you mean is not, "I want you to move to Dallas."
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:24.080]   You mean, "And then my friend, she posted on Instagram
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.780]   "about like, I love Dallas so much."
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.300]   And I was like, "Man, maybe I would like Dallas too.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.660]   "Maybe this is God."
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.340]   Maybe it is, maybe it's not.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.780]   Maybe a better thing to say is,
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.300]   "I think maybe God wants me to move in Dallas."
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.460]   But representing something that you can't clearly articulate
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.220]   or especially if it doesn't align with God's word,
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.700]   you are stepping in dangerous territory.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.860]   Especially you should take that off the table
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.220]   in a dating world.
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.600]   And if somebody breaks up with you and they say,
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.660]   "Hey, I feel like God told me,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.940]   "or God wants me to be single."
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.700]   You should thank God that this person
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.560]   is not a big enough responsible person to say,
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.840]   "You know what, I just need to break up with you
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.900]   "'cause I don't wanna date right now."
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.780]   And they're blaming it on God and God's up there like,
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.020]   "No, I didn't say that.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.660]   "God didn't blame it on me, man."
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.740]   But we know everything that God says,
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.660]   we can have confidence.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:13.620]   It is inspired, God told me.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.300]   And then he says, "Hey, this is how God and his word
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.040]   "is useful inside of our life or profitable for teaching."
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.700]   This is huge, man, this is so huge.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.180]   God's word, here's how to understand what God's word is.
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.180]   It is teaching you about the person of Christ
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   and the perspective of God.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.940]   It teaches us the person of Jesus and God's perspective,
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.940]   which is the right perspective or the true perspective
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.740]   'cause he's the creator.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.340]   And when we read the Bible, we see
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.020]   and are able to more clearly see
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.980]   how God says we're to think about our time,
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.620]   how God says we're to think about marriage,
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.820]   how God says we're to use our relationships,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.780]   how God says we're to use our tongue, our mouth,
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.620]   what is true, what matters, how this life is a vapor.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.660]   We're introduced to God's perspective in the Bible.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.980]   In other words, the Bible is not a magic eight ball
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.020]   that you go to and just go,
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.100]   "What am I supposed to do with my life?
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.300]   "Am I supposed to marry her?"
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.780]   And flip it open and just hope that it's there,
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.380]   which is honestly, this is a magic eight ball.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.340]   This is how a lot of people read their Bible,
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.520]   where they go to it and they're like,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.700]   "Man, am I supposed to move to Dallas
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.700]   "or maybe I'm supposed to take that job?"
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.640]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.940]   Yes, definitely.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.540]   And they'll do the same thing.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.140]   It doesn't look like a magic eight ball, though.
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.860]   They do it with the Bible and they flip it open.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.180]   (laughing)
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.220]   Some of you guys, this is you.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.620]   They're like, "Man, I don't know
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.640]   "if I'm supposed to marry Sarah,
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.740]   "I'm supposed to keep dating Sarah,
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.060]   "or maybe I'm supposed to ask Sarah out."
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.260]   And they flip it open and they're like,
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.780]   "And Abraham married Sarai."
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.340]   God.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.140]   Sarah, God told me I'm supposed to marry you.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.860]   And it's not how you're supposed to apply the Bible.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   It is the words of God that introduce you
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.480]   to the perspective of how God thinks.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.540]   And how God would say to see work,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.860]   to see relationships, what matters in marriage,
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.420]   and who to marry.
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.940]   And in studying it,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.460]   we're able to not rip things out of context.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.620]   Because that's the danger.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.020]   And Candle, I'm gonna pick on preachers.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.900]   Preachers can rip things out of context
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.620]   and say, say something, make the Bible say something
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.100]   that is not what it was saying,
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.300]   or is not saying to you.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.620]   And I'm not saying it's necessarily untrue,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.420]   but you can rip it out and you can make it say anything.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.420]   The other day I was with my kids
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   and we were about to go hang out and do scooter races.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.020]   My son and my daughter.
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   And my son goes here and he's at church on Sundays
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.300]   and they were learning about Genesis and Adam and Eve.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.140]   And he looks at me and goes,
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.740]   "Dad, boys win, girls lose."
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.820]   And I was like, "Really?"
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.900]   Yeah, because Adam was made first.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.060]   So he got here first and the girl got here second.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.360]   So boys win, girls lose.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.580]   Now, biblically, that is an accurate sentence,
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.500]   Adam was made first.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.740]   It is not an accurate application to go, so girls lose.
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.860]   And that's funny when you're five.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.740]   When you're 25, it is sad.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.620]   It is more common than you think.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.660]   And so understanding, man, I come to God's Word
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.740]   and I'm gonna read it, I'm gonna understand what it says.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.960]   I'm gonna prioritize knowing it in my life.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.920]   To do that, I have to spend time in it.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.100]   Not going through reels on Instagram or some sermon clip.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.020]   I'm gonna spend personal time.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.900]   There's never been more resources on how to do this.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.500]   Let me give you a couple that are amazing.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.300]   There's a project, there's a group called Bible Recap
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.820]   that is an incredible resource.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.180]   There you go, got some fans of it.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.700]   They're gonna walk you through God's Word in a year.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.060]   There's another app called Dwell app.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.180]   There's You version.
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.860]   There's never been more resources
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:46.860]   on how you can personally walk intimately
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.300]   and listen to God.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.040]   Spend time every day.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.760]   You know what the word listen and silent have in common?
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.860]   All the same letters.
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.480]   In order to listen to God,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.760]   it requires me being silent personally.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.400]   God, will you speak to me?
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.420]   I wanna study and understand what you are saying here.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.320]   So it teaches us and then it corrects or reproves us,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.560]   which is a word that I don't think a lot of us often like
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.760]   because when we think correction,
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.080]   we hear the voice of condemnation.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.440]   We hear God going, get it together!
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.220]   How long is it gonna be like this?
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.160]   Maybe because of a parent
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.320]   or maybe because of family relationship
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.520]   or whatever reason, you just read it
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.300]   and you just feel like shame.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.980]   Because of Jesus and what he did on the cross,
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.200]   there is no shame and guilt for followers of Christ.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.560]   So any loving correction is just that.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.680]   It is a loving, hey, I'm gonna move you back on the path.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.080]   It's how I want you to use your tongue.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.520]   It's how I want you to speak.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.880]   And when you come to it, I'm gonna go,
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.040]   man, God, this is what you say to do.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.880]   And so I'm gonna trust you.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.080]   You're a loving father that's not shouting,
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.960]   condemning at me, but lovingly correcting me.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.320]   It's like the Waze app.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.760]   I don't know if you guys use Waze or Apple Map,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.680]   Google, they all work the same, but Waze is better.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.560]   And that app, it does something.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.920]   If you miss the turn, it course corrects.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:02.960]   In other words, if you're driving on the road
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.800]   and sometimes you're just like,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.280]   man, is this the street, is this the street?
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.400]   You miss the exit and it doesn't say,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.380]   hey, just back the car up and go back on the highway.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.760]   It course corrects.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.280]   It shows you, all right, we missed that one.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.180]   Here's how you get back on the path.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.520]   That's what God's word does.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.600]   It's called a light, a lamp unto our feet,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.440]   a light to our path.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.600]   It's God saying, man, here's how to continue
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.800]   getting back on the direction.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.080]   Here's how you should have relationships,
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.480]   authentic community around you.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.680]   I'm gonna keep course correcting.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.040]   I'm gonna keep encouraging you to stay on the path.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.440]   It also tells us that there should be times
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.720]   that as believers, man, when you read the Bible,
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.040]   it's gonna disagree with you.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.480]   Like, if this happens, man, when you read verses,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:50.480]   and like, Jesus at times should bother you.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.980]   Like, you're like, man, that's not what I would wanna do
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.900]   or I would wanna live.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.420]   And that's, Paul would say, it's correcting,
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.920]   aligning us with God, with God's word says.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.860]   You have times where you can even think like,
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.700]   oh man, there's times where God,
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:08.580]   man, it's not what I would do,
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.220]   but it's what God clearly says, so I'm gonna do it.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.100]   It's not the direction I would go,
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.380]   but it's clearly the course correction
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.200]   that God would have me take.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.780]   I'm gonna do it.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.340]   Paul says all of this is what we get access to
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:20.380]   through the perspective of God.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.060]   And then finally, the training in righteousness
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.540]   to be complete, to be equipped for good works,
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.580]   to live out our faith.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.580]   Let me give a side note really quick.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.420]   A lot of people have a question of,
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.860]   man, I don't know if I can trust the Bible.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.980]   And they don't trust the Bible 'cause say,
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.420]   some professor at some college was like,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.100]   you know, the Bible contradicts itself
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.740]   and it's been changed over time.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.140]   Let me share something.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.080]   In grad school, we had to take classes
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.440]   on some of the most boring things
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.680]   I've ever studied in my life.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.540]   And you know what they were?
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.760]   Some of the differences in the manuscripts
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.240]   or the passing on of the New Testament.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.160]   Why do I say that they were boring?
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.400]   Because you would study and you're like,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.760]   dude, I'm about to find out,
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.800]   people say the Bible's been changed,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.640]   I'm about to find out which places it has,
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.280]   and they walk it through.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.520]   Let me give you an example of one of the changes.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.160]   There's a place in the Bible
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.100]   where one version has John with two Ns
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.480]   and one has it with one.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.340]   In other words, there's no place where you read it
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.480]   and it's like, man, this one says Jesus was crucified,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.520]   this one says he got kicked by a donkey,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.860]   and this one says he fell off a cliff.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.920]   Doesn't exist.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.680]   Because the changes or any of those changes
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.900]   are so insignificant.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.240]   We have so many copies, we know what the essence
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.820]   and truth and what was actually written that is there.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.360]   People don't reject the Bible
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.400]   'cause it contradicts themself,
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.640]   they reject it because it contradicts them.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.200]   They don't like what it says about homosexuality,
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.600]   they don't like what it says about sexuality,
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.800]   about dating, about relationships,
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.680]   and we can clap, but if you're in that camp
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.600]   and still like, man, I think so,
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.480]   but I don't really know, you at least owe it to yourself
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.040]   to say, I am going to study
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.240]   and be informed about what it is.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.840]   I'm not gonna hide behind, well,
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   you know, I saw an Oprah one time at the Bible,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.060]   because you'll discover it hasn't been changed.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.760]   It is trustworthy, you can trust it,
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.320]   and it is the voice of God, inspired by God himself.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.600]   And then Paul finishes and tells us something
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.620]   that's so key to us, and he writes,
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:23.200]   and he's writing these last words,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.360]   and it would be hard to estimate
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.640]   how much emotion Timothy would have
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.720]   when he read these things,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.280]   and Paul would have when he said and wrote these things.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.520]   All these years of walking in relationship,
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.640]   being mentored by Paul, being led to Christ by Paul,
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.160]   and Paul, knowing he's about to die and go be with the Lord,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.840]   writes these things to Timothy,
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.160]   and they apply not just to him, but to us.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.360]   I charge you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.080]   who is to judge the living and the dead,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.100]   and by his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.800]   preach the word or share the gospel.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.440]   Be ready in season and out of season,
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.480]   when it's popular and when it's not popular.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.920]   Reprove, rebuke, and exhort
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.680]   with complete patience and teaching,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.160]   for the time is coming
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.580]   when people will not endure sound teaching.
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.760]   Let me read that again,
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.280]   because he begins to describe a time
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.640]   that is strikingly parallel to the moment that we're in.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.760]   A time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching,
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.440]   the teaching of what God's word says,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.880]   but having itching ears,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.340]   they will accumulate for themselves other teachers,
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.880]   other things to suit their own passions
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.800]   or their own desires.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.520]   They'll find things that allow them, hey, you do you.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.000]   Don't let anybody tell you to be different.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.480]   You should embrace who you are.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.480]   Love is love.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.280]   You choose what is best for your body and your choice,
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.640]   and they won't hold to truth,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.360]   and they will turn away from listening to the truth
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.380]   and wander off into myths.
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.520]   As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering,
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.720]   and do the work of an evangelist or an ambassador.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.240]   Fulfill your ministry.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.720]   Paul, knowing he's about to go, he says,
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.840]   man, Timothy, hold onto this book,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.580]   and not only that, share this book.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.560]   Let it inform your life.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.160]   Other people are gonna wander off into myths.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.480]   Other people are gonna wander off
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.320]   and searching for things that'll just inform them
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.520]   to whatever they want to do.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.120]   They'll look for somebody to reinforce that, but not you.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.880]   You hold onto truth, and you share what is true.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.060]   The main character of the Bible is Jesus.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.720]   The author of the Bible is God,
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.600]   and the ambassadors of the Bible are you and I
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.240]   or anyone just like Timothy who is a follower of Christ.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.580]   We are called to now go and share what was shared with us,
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.240]   that we are not to be, you know,
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.740]   brand ambassadors are huge right now.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.820]   You and I are called to be brand or Bible ambassadors
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.300]   for God in how we speak and how we live it out
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.060]   and how we promote it to other people.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.300]   In other words, Paul brings up,
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.820]   hey, it should inform your life.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.660]   You and I should be able to say,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.980]   hey, let me tell you I believe the Bible
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.060]   without telling you I believe the Bible
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.020]   through how I live.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.820]   And he would say, you and I are the ambassadors
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.660]   of what is true.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.620]   A time is coming where people are gonna turn away
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.500]   and wander into myths.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.500]   What does this look like?
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.940]   I think probably one of the more common expressions
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.820]   in our culture where we're seeing this happen,
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.540]   where they wander from truth and wander to a myth
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:43.140]   is a common ideology around truth,
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.560]   that truth is no longer a universal thing.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.900]   You hear people in the way that they talk,
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.900]   common vernacular is, truth is not universal.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.640]   I mean, what's true for you may not be true for him,
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.900]   and you need to do your truth and speak your truth.
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.500]   It's not universal.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.780]   And you can define what you think is true.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.860]   It's a message that's everywhere.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.900]   And it's a message that has significant consequences
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.340]   because no longer are you going,
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.900]   hey, this is the source of truth.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.500]   I'm going to God on how to live.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.260]   I just go off of me.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.540]   And our culture and the world around us,
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.580]   it is clearly wandered off into myths.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.340]   What do I mean by that?
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.180]   Unlike the Bible, which teaches there's two genders,
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.540]   there's male and female.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   The explosive movement around transgenderism is staggering,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.900]   but it is what happens and makes sense.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.500]   If you don't have a source of truth,
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.740]   you just define what is truth.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.380]   In fact, in 2014, Facebook released at that time, 2014,
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.500]   here are the 58 genders that we believe exist.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.740]   This isn't some random guy in a basement.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.980]   This is one of the biggest companies in America.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.460]   And it's what happens when you don't have a source of truth.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.920]   You're your source of truth.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:00.040]   And Paul says, you're going to wander off into destruction.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.640]   They're going to walk through and define it.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.320]   Man, that's not what God says.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.740]   This is what I say.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.840]   On the subject of life, my wife and I are pregnant
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.560]   with our third child right now.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.400]   (congregation cheering)
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.240]   Thank you.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:20.200]   We had a almost 20 week sonogram this past week,
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.040]   and it was actually right at 19.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.180]   And in fact, here's a picture.
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.940]   This is our baby.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.400]   Hand reaching up, see his nose.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.180]   When you don't have a source of truth,
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.400]   like God's word that says, man, life begins at conception.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.920]   If abortion is a part of your story,
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.660]   there is so much grace and love,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.380]   and God has nothing before you.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.860]   He wants to use that and heal that
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.700]   and be more deeply united to you
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.580]   than you could even understand.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.740]   But when you and I,
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.500]   or when a culture doesn't have a source of truth,
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.600]   they just define it, you lead to things like,
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.460]   that's not a human life if the mom disagrees
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.660]   or if the mom doesn't want it.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.460]   And in every state in the country,
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.560]   including this one until a few days ago.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.860]   (congregation cheering)
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:15.420]   Someone could make the decision,
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.420]   I don't want to have that life anymore
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.900]   and have a child terminated.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.980]   Because it's what happens
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.120]   when you wander away from the truth and you define,
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.860]   because the truth for a lot of people is like,
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.740]   hey, it's my body, you don't have a choice over it
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.000]   to tell me to do with my body,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.620]   which contradicts the truth from God's word.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.460]   And you know what?
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.180]   There's things I wouldn't write,
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.620]   it's not comfortable to say,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.620]   it's not, oh, you know, like, hey, this is just my opinion,
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.580]   but I'm still called to think, to live, to share,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.900]   to kindly with patience and love,
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.940]   especially as it relates to Christians.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.620]   The concern God has for people who don't know Jesus
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.820]   is first and foremost, knowing Jesus.
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.100]   But when it comes to being united,
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.300]   being united on what is true,
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.060]   on things like his creation, life,
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.380]   are non-negotiables for followers of Christ
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.020]   or things related to the idea of marriage
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.100]   and a culture when you don't have truth,
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.900]   it's, hey, love is love, it doesn't matter who you marry.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.740]   When God says there is clear design
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.860]   that I have for the context of marriage,
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.820]   there's so many of these myths,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.260]   like faiths, all of them teach the same thing,
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.420]   good people go to heaven.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.540]   Or on an individual level,
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.040]   probably as much, if not more common in this room,
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.300]   of myths like, hey, living with your girlfriends,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.860]   not that big of a deal, we save rent,
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.300]   married in God's eyes, having sex before marriage,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.140]   you know, we're gonna get married,
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.020]   we love each other anyways, not that big of a deal,
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.940]   which are myths.
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.180]   And Paul would say, Timothy, hold onto the truth,
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.700]   let what informs your life and your decisions
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.500]   be the words of God himself,
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.140]   that that will be the guide, the instruction,
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.300]   that you're gonna hold onto
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.180]   when everyone else is walking away.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.780]   That in other words, he uses a phrase,
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.500]   in season and out of season,
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.740]   which is a phrase that means you share and you hold these
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.440]   when it's popular and when it's not popular.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.660]   There should be times that it's Jesus' followers,
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.980]   according to Paul, everybody else is walking this way,
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.140]   and because of what the Bible says, we go,
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.320]   man, I gotta go this way.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.620]   That if everyone always agrees with you,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.380]   and the world always agrees with you and how you think,
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.780]   you don't think like the word of God,
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.540]   you think like the world around you.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.940]   And you and I are called to be informed and to hold on.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.820]   He says, Timothy, this book is so crucial
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.900]   for you to live God's call on your life,
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.340]   and it's gonna be crucial, Timothy,
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.420]   for generations of the church to come.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.060]   I'm dying, Timothy, I'm about to go,
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.540]   I'm gonna see Jesus' face soon,
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:44.300]   and you're gonna be here, and while you're here,
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.100]   I want you to know you have everything you need in Christ
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.860]   through the Spirit of God and the word of God
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.580]   with the people of God, and you live it out,
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.840]   you hold onto it, Timothy.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.220]   When everybody else walks away from it,
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.300]   you hold onto it and you don't let go.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.900]   And he would say the same to you and the same to me.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.540]   My wife this week was driving her car
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.260]   and she called me on Monday, and we're headed to,
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.380]   I was headed to coach my son's soccer team,
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.480]   and she called me and she was gonna drop him off
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.540]   at a soccer practice and I was gonna meet him there.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.460]   She called and she said, hey, somebody just rolled up
[00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.500]   next to me and rolled the window down and says,
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.540]   ma'am, your car is smoking, there's liquid coming out
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.580]   of the bottom and the engine, and she said,
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.820]   and then the engine just went overheated,
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.580]   the overheating light came on and it began to shut down
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.780]   and I pulled into a parking lot.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:31.860]   Called a tow truck, got it taken to the auto repair place,
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.540]   and I asked the auto repair, you know, what's going on,
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.380]   and they eventually discovered that the coolant tubes
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.980]   had disconnected, and all that coolant
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:44.060]   that keeps the engine cool and allows it to function
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:48.320]   had been disconnected, and so it was not able to drive
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.140]   because it wasn't able to function,
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.460]   because it had been disconnected
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.160]   from the thing that allowed it to.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.880]   Paul is telling Timothy, you stay connected.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.620]   Don't get disconnected from the thing
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.440]   that will allow you to function.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.580]   From one of the primary things, the spirit of God
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.620]   and the word of God and the people of God,
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.300]   don't get disconnected from any of those,
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.020]   and don't get disconnected, but you be united in truth
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.620]   that you would walk in God's way
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.420]   so that your faith will function,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.200]   and if you are not spending time and listening to God,
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.580]   you are being disconnected or are disconnected.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.780]   I don't mean personally, not that you listen
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.180]   to a podcast on the way here, not that you, you know,
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.700]   read a verse a day just on some scrolling
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.740]   through a meme on Instagram, I mean personally.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.140]   God, I wanna listen, I want my relationship with you,
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.520]   not someone else's, I wanna listen to you.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.540]   He would say, you're disconnected
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.740]   from one of the primary things that allows your faith
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.260]   to flourish and to function.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.500]   In conclusion, the Bible tells us about the person of Jesus,
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.800]   the main character, Jesus.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:49.960]   It teaches us the perspective of God
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.220]   from the author who's God, and it prepares us
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:55.580]   to live God's way or to be ambassadors for the Bible.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.940]   Let me close with one verse.
[00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.420]   There's a verse that, a couple verses that Jesus,
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.460]   it was hours before he was gonna be crucified.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.580]   It's called the High Priestly Prayer.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.180]   It's several chapters in the book of John.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.420]   Jesus prays and prays for his disciples that are there,
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.420]   and he's literally hours from going to die.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.540]   And he's praying over his guys, and he's praying,
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.940]   God, would they be united just like me and you are?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.020]   And he's praying that they would have truth
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.580]   that would transform them.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.780]   And then he brings up another group of people,
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.340]   and he says, I wanna pray for these.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.180]   And it's not the 12 that are there.
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.300]   He brings up you, and he brings up me.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.260]   And I wanna walk through what he prays,
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.580]   because it's at the heart of Jesus saying,
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:50.580]   the same idea of the importance of how God's word
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:54.340]   leads us to him, to God's perspective,
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:58.060]   and it's something that we allow to lead our life.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.860]   John chapter 17, he says this, verse 17.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.660]   Speaking of the father, do you make them holy?
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.580]   Your translation may have sanctified them
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.260]   or transform them, God, by your truth.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:18.300]   Teach them your word, which is truth.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.020]   Just as you sent me into the world,
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.660]   I am gonna send them into the world.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.660]   And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.100]   that they can be made holy or transformed by your word.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:38.420]   I am praying, and he switches the focus
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:43.420]   to include not just them, not only for these disciples,
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:49.260]   but also for anyone who will ever believe in me
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:54.900]   through their message, which is you and me.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:00.220]   I pray that they will all be one, united,
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.300]   just as you and I are one, as you are in me,
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.700]   the father, and I am in you, so that they may believe,
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   they may be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.980]   Jesus says, Father, I pray for these guys.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.540]   I pray that you would allow your truth to transform them.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:21.140]   And I don't just wanna pray for these.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.180]   I wanna pray for anyone who will ever believe in me,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:28.420]   for you, that they would walk in that truth
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.540]   and be united together.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.140]   Why was Jesus so passionate about that?
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.660]   I'm laying on the plane.
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.820]   Because he knew that it is in walking with him,
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.980]   living according to what he says is true,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.740]   that you and I are the light
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.860]   in the midst of a world of darkness.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.340]   And we are united together to push back,
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.340]   not just what we feel is right, but what he says is right.
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.180]   In the midst of a world full of darkness,
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:57.180]   light spreads and shines and pushes back what is dark.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.740]   It's like this, Billy, you bring the lights down.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:05.820]   All of you on your wrists, bracelets.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:12.500]   And the movement of Christ has always been
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.940]   that his people would be informed,
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.620]   and being informed by God's word, they would be a light.
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.180]   And the more disconnected you are
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.020]   from the truth of God's word, the less of a light you are.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.860]   But whenever you live, and I live out what God says in here,
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.860]   we become a light that pushes back in a world of darkness,
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.620]   and the darker it gets, the brighter the light seems.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.300]   And the movement of Christianity has always spread
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.380]   on people who are surrendered to the word of God.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.540]   And it begins to spread, and it begins to spread,
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.260]   and it begins to spread, and it begins to spread.
[00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.860]   And I want you to imagine what would happen in our world
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.100]   if the 4,000 here just say,
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.020]   I'm not listening to what Beyonce says,
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.580]   what Culture says, what Vogue magazine says,
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.500]   what BuzzFeed says, I'm listening to the word of my creator,
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.980]   to God Almighty, I'm gonna walk with Jesus
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.740]   from the truth of his word.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.140]   The world would be awakened to the source of life,
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:05.140]   the source of hope, the source of peace,
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.980]   and the source of truth, which is Jesus.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:14.260]   And in the Bible, we encounter him, his perspective,
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.180]   and are given the chance to go share that
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.100]   with the world around us, united in truth.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.940]   We pray, Father, I thank you that you made him
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.140]   who knew no sin to become sin, so that in him,
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.700]   we would become the righteousness of God.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.700]   I pray that this would be a generation
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.340]   that says, though none go with me, I will follow.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.700]   I'm gonna walk like God calls me to.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:38.900]   I'm gonna do it imperfectly,
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.260]   I'm gonna do it with people around me,
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.780]   but I am gonna hold on to what is true,
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.820]   and I'm gonna hold on to my Savior.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:52.420]   And then I, as I study, I'm reminded of who he is,
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.220]   who he says I am, where life is found.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.700]   And I pray that you would unleash a movement
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.980]   across our country of revival through the men and women here
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.300]   who live categorically different
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.060]   than how everyone in their town lives,
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.300]   everyone in their apartment lives,
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.340]   everyone in their city and college lives.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.540]   And as you transform them,
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:18.140]   they would be a part of how you transform the world.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.020]   Teach us to know your ways,
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.060]   that we would walk in your truth.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.340]   We worship you in song, amen.
