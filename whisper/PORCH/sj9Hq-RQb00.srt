1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:27,940
 - What's up guys?

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,780
 How we doing?

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,600
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,440
 Come on.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,760
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
 It's good to be with you guys here in Dallas, Fort Worth.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,580
 We're glad you're tuning in and those listening around.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,260
 I'm gonna start with a reading from the scriptures,

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,640
 if you will, the Jesus Storybook Bible.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,160
 Have you ever needed just to be reminded that God loves you?

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,280
 Yeah, good.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,860
 And so, there was this time, there was this week,

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,000
 there was a tough week.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,220
 I was teaching on a Sunday.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,760
 I was looking for an illustration, I couldn't find it.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,840
 I was beginning to get angry with God

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,960
 that he wouldn't give it to me.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,840
 This is kind of like if you're in sales, you know,

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
 and you're not getting the deal,

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,280
 or if things aren't going your way at work as a preacher,

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,760
 you know, it's like, God, I need this illustration.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,020
 And it's Saturday evening and I don't have it yet.

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,360
 And so, I'm tucking my girls, Presley and Finley, in bed

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,320
 and I'm reading them a story from here, but I'm distracted.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,300
 If I'm honest with you, to be transparent,

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,740
 in the moment I was really distracted,

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,820
 my mind was just spinning like,

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,980
 God, I need this illustration, I need this illustration.

30
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,820
 So, I'm reading this and we're just moving

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,280
 through the Jesus Storybook Bible we had just started over.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,900
 And so, I'm in Genesis six through nine.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,580
 It says, "Time passed and many people filled the earth.

34
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,760
 "Everyone everywhere had forgotten about God

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,160
 "and were only doing bad things all the time.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,780
 "God's heart was filled with pain

37
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,200
 "when he saw what had happened to the world he loved.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,000
 "Everywhere was disease and death and destruction,

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,360
 "all the things God hates most.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,180
 "Now, Noah was God's friend, which was odd in those days

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,240
 "because no one else was.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,480
 "Noah listened to God, he talked to God.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,860
 "He just loved being with God

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,120
 "like you do with your best friend.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,360
 "Noah, God said, things have gone wrong.

46
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,260
 "People have filled my world with hate instead of love.

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,400
 "They are destroying themselves and each other and my world.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,960
 "I must stop them.

49
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,480
 "First, we'll build an ark."

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,420
 And I'll tell you the story tonight,

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,740
 so I'll jump to the end.

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,080
 Here's the punchline.

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
 It says, "And there in the clouds,

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,940
 "just where the storm meets the sun

55
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,380
 "was a beautiful bow made of light.

56
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,220
 "It was a new beginning in God's world.

57
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,120
 "It wasn't long before everything went wrong again,

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,520
 "but God wasn't surprised.

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,600
 "He knew this would happen.

60
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,320
 "That's why before the beginning of time,

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,280
 "he had another plan, a better plan,

62
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,880
 "a plan not to destroy the world, but to rescue it.

63
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,860
 "A plan to one day send his own son, the rescuer."

64
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,680
 I said, "Good night, Presley.

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,660
 "Good night, Finley.

66
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,120
 "Daddy loves you."

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,140
 I walked out of their room.

68
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,140
 I said, "God, have you forgotten about me?

69
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,560
 "I mean, you know what I gotta do tomorrow, right?"

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,700
 And I walked from their room to set something in the kitchen

71
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,900
 and I looked out the window

72
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,600
 and I saw all of my neighbors gathering in the street,

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
 which is weird.

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,500
 Everybody kind of coming out of their houses

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 and gathering in the street

76
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,840
 and I set something down in the kitchen.

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,700
 I went to the front door and I went outside

78
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,580
 and I went in the street to see what the commotion was.

79
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,820
 Hey guys, what are y'all doing?

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,420
 And they pointed and I looked

81
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,100
 and in the sky was this incredible rainbow.

82
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,820
 I mean, a whole rainbow stretching from the east to the west

83
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:47,280
 and God said, "No, I hadn't forgotten about you, dude.

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,060
 "I hadn't forgotten about you, bro."

85
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,160
 And it was more than ironic.

86
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,200
 It was one of those moments in my life.

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,020
 In fact, that's what I opened with the next day

88
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,860
 was that story.

89
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,480
 That was the illustration that I needed

90
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,620
 and it's crazy, right?

91
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,340
 This symbol of God's promise that we've forgotten,

92
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,580
 that we've watered down and give other meanings to.

93
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,240
 This incredible rainbow that hangs in the sky

94
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,260
 is God's promise that he will not destroy the world again.

95
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,880
 As we sat in here last week,

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
 you remember at the end of the message,

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,640
 it was pouring down rain.

98
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
 I even made mention of that.

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,080
 Well, in Fort Worth, this is what they saw

100
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,280
 over the Ridgely Theater.

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,720
 There's hundreds of young adults

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,520
 gathered in Fort Worth right now.

103
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,020
 But last week, this was a picture

104
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,220
 that one of the folks there had taken

105
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,800
 because it had rained there as well

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,520
 and there was this promise from God

107
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,000
 that he will not destroy the world again.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And isn't it ironic

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,720
 that we take this old man with a beard and a staff

110
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
 standing outside a giant boat

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,800
 and animals gathered two by two

112
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,180
 and we paint murals on nursery walls

113
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,760
 and we say things to kids like,

114
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,640
 "Hey, tonight I've got a story for you.

115
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,340
 "It's about when God regretted making humans

116
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,000
 "and killed everyone."

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
 (congregation laughing)

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
 And then we're gonna go to bed, sleep tight, you know?

119
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,220
 It's crazy.

120
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,660
 This story is crazy what it means

121
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,720
 and that it happened.

122
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,760
 And the truth that it teaches us,

123
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,400
 see, Noah had neighbors, he had friends,

124
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,320
 he had people he worked with,

125
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,460
 and they all died.

126
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,540
 And they all faced God's judgment.

127
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,140
 And you and I sit in the same reality.

128
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,080
 We have friends and family

129
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,060
 and people we work with.

130
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,480
 And they're all going to die.

131
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,040
 And they will all face the same judgment.

132
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,880
 And God will judge the world again, not by flood,

133
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,940
 says in 2 Peter, but by fire this time.

134
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,000
 That's a sobering reality.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,760
 And so this story tonight,

136
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,820
 we're talking about Noah and the ark

137
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,800
 and a reminder of God's promises.

138
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 This story has this incredible truth

139
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,520
 that we need to learn from this evening.

140
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,480
 We need to be reminded why God preserved this story

141
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,440
 in Scripture and how important it is for us

142
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,840
 because God's judgment is real.

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,920
 So as we travel through this story,

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,680
 we're just gonna look at the evidence of Noah's story,

145
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,080
 the significance of Noah's story.

146
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,060
 And before you leave here, the application of Noah's story,

147
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,400
 if you're just joining us this evening,

148
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,720
 we're moving through a series called BC,

149
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,760
 which stands for before Christ.

150
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,560
 We now count 2016 years from the birth

151
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,940
 of a man named Jesus.

152
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,560
 Every atheist you know dates their checks.

153
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,880
 2016 years from his birth, he reset the calendar.

154
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,560
 The Bible is divided into two parts,

155
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,040
 the Old Testament and the New Testament.

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
 So we are traveling through the Old Testament

157
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
 in this series called BC.

158
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,960
 Tonight, we're looking at Noah.

159
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,120
 Last week, we looked at the creation of humanity,

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,120
 Adam and Eve, the fall, sin entered the world.

161
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
 Adam and Eve had two sons, Cain and Abel.

162
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,440
 Because the world was fractured with sin,

163
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,000
 Cain kills Abel out of jealousy.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
 He kills his brother.

165
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,520
 We see the wickedness and sin spread.

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,920
 Abel is replaced by a son named Seth.

167
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,140
 The name Seth means in place of.

168
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,560
 And we begin to see the substitutionary atonement

169
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,080
 of Jesus Christ from Genesis 3 on into the story

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,040
 that Jesus would die in our place.

171
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,300
 And then from Seth, ultimately came Christ

172
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,000
 by way of a man named Noah.

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,160
 A man named Noah.

174
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,920
 I'll read to you from Genesis chapter six.

175
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,540
 The story is told, chapters five through chapters nine.

176
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,160
 Of course, we're gonna skip around some.

177
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,680
 God looks down, he sees evil, and he's going to hit reset.

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,640
 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race

179
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,340
 had become on the earth, and that every inclination

180
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,580
 of the thoughts of the human heart

181
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,880
 was only evil all the time.

182
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
 The Lord regretted that he had made human beings

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,360
 on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled.

184
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,700
 Maybe the saddest verse in all of the 66 books of the Bible.

185
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,280
 That God looked down and the Hebrews said he repented.

186
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,880
 He wanted to turn away from.

187
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,540
 The reason being 'cause he saw that man had turned

188
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,860
 not only on him, but on each other.

189
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,240
 And that the world was a terrible place to live,

190
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,960
 full of wickedness, hate, murder, and disease, and death.

191
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,640
 So the Lord said, I will wipe from the face of the earth

192
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,080
 the human race I have created, and with them the animals,

193
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,400
 the birds, and the creatures that move along the ground.

194
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,900
 For I regret that I have made them.

195
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,560
 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.

196
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,080
 Where it says he found favor in the eyes of the Lord,

197
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
 it's the Hebrew word hein.

198
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,820
 It's the Hebrew word translated into Greek

199
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,000
 and then English, grace.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,740
 But Noah had God's grace rest upon him.

201
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,280
 This is the account of Noah and his family.

202
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,800
 Noah was a righteous man,

203
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,660
 blameless among the people of his time.

204
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,100
 And he walked faithfully with God.

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,160
 Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

206
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
 Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight

207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,880
 and was full of violence.

208
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,440
 God saw how corrupt the earth had become,

209
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,300
 for all the people on the earth had corrupted their ways.

210
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,960
 So God said to Noah, I am going to put an end to all people,

211
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,920
 for the earth is filled with violence because of them.

212
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,400
 I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.

213
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,240
 So make yourself an ark of cypress wood.

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,520
 Make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.

215
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,880
 Then he goes into great detail

216
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,180
 of how specifically to make this ark.

217
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,840
 Verse 18, but I will establish my covenant with you

218
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
 and you will enter the ark.

219
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,800
 A covenant is a one-sided promise.

220
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,620
 It's not a I promise if you.

221
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,880
 It's a I will, period.

222
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,120
 It's a till death do us part.

223
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,440
 Sickness and in health, rich or poor,

224
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,900
 no matter what you do to me, I will.

225
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,040
 But I will establish my covenant with you

226
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,360
 and you will enter the ark, you and your sons

227
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,020
 and your wife and your sons' wives with you.

228
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,000
 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures,

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
 male and female, to keep them alive with you.

230
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,640
 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal,

231
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,440
 and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground

232
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,500
 will come to you to be kept alive.

233
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,120
 You are to let every kind of food that is to be eaten

234
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,080
 and store it away as food for you and for them.

235
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,360
 And then it says this beautiful verse in verse 22.

236
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,320
 Noah did everything just as God commanded him.

237
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,400
 Who was this man?

238
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,320
 Someone chosen by God out of grace

239
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,160
 who responded faithfully to that call.

240
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,640
 When we were looking for a name of our son,

241
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,840
 who's now three, Weston one, that's his name,

242
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,400
 but I wanted to name him Noah.

243
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,140
 You see how much clout I have in my family.

244
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,420
 I wanted to name him Noah.

245
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,600
 And the reason I wanted to name him Noah

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,360
 is because this guy who stood all by himself in creation

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,440
 as everyone mocked him and everyone said, you're a weirdo.

248
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,680
 What are you doing?

249
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,840
 Why are you doing that?

250
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,800
 I said, man, I'm just gonna faithfully follow God.

251
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 And he did so alone.

252
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,520
 You ever felt alone on this walk?

253
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,700
 You ever felt like you're the only Christian at work,

254
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,660
 the only Christian at school,

255
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,960
 the only Christian on your street

256
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
 in your apartment complex?

257
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,800
 Noah was the only believer, follower of God on the planet.

258
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,820
 On the planet.

259
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,680
 Very, very alone.

260
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,460
 The story is not about Noah though.

261
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,920
 It's really about God's judgment.

262
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,120
 Noah is a character in it.

263
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,280
 The story is about God's faithfulness.

264
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,680
 And yes, I'm going to tell you that God is loving

265
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,760
 from a story where he destroyed everyone.

266
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,680
 I'm going to show you hopefully from the scriptures

267
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,840
 that this was a loving act from him

268
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,740
 because God did what he said he was going to do.

269
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,860
 But Noah would have been crazy, right?

270
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,600
 This man would have been seen as a lunatic.

271
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,360
 Could you imagine being his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth?

272
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,880
 You go to school, you get beat up because of your names.

273
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,680
 And then you go home and your dad's building

274
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,560
 this big old ark, you know, a big boat in the front yard.

275
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
 This would be the equivalent of your dad

276
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
 building a time machine on the front lawn.

277
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
 You know, your friends are like,

278
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,880
 hey, what's your dad doing?

279
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,000
 You're like, oh, you know, just building a time machine.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,240
 I don't know.

281
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,920
 God told him to, you know.

282
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,840
 This would be crazy, this man, right?

283
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,560
 Everybody would have thought he was absolutely insane.

284
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,240
 And some people would think that you're insane

285
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,160
 for believing it.

286
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,040
 Was it a local flood, a global flood?

287
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,240
 Did it really, you believe, Miley Cyrus said

288
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,960
 you would be effing crazy to believe that fairy tale?

289
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,420
 Well, no offense, Miley, but I'm gonna go with God over you,

290
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,080
 okay, if that's cool.

291
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,780
 So let's look at the evidence of Noah's story, okay?

292
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,540
 ABC recently, not too long ago, did a special

293
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,240
 revealing new discovery and showing evidence of the flood.

294
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,340
 And they always seem to be surprised.

295
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,900
 They always take this approach like, yeah, well,

296
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,180
 it seems like this part of the Bible could actually be true.

297
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,700
 And I'm like, yeah, well, that's because God wrote it.

298
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,700
 And so it was not a local flood, but a worldwide flood.

299
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,860
 I'm gonna give you some evidence of that.

300
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,360
 In fact, chromosomal research, and this is a lot

301
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,300
 of crazy stuff, heady stuff that I can't go too deep in.

302
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,460
 And so at nine o'clock tonight, I'm gonna tweet out

303
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,320
 several articles.

304
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,440
 If you follow on Twitter, you can grab those.

305
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,340
 You wanna go deeper into this, you can read those articles.

306
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,340
 But it has been recently discovered that in recent history,

307
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,380
 within the past 10,000 years, probably about 3,500 years ago

308
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,840
 there was a bottleneck in humanity, okay?

309
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,520
 So much so that they have now discovered,

310
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,100
 they've traced this back down to three women, okay?

311
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,060
 That three women were able to procreate life

312
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,380
 at some point in recent history about 3,500 years ago.

313
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,300
 How about that, okay?

314
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,140
 Maybe Shem, Ham, and Japheth's wife,

315
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,580
 because we know Noah's wife didn't have any more children

316
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,260
 after the flood.

317
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,100
 All around the world, there's evidence

318
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,060
 of a cataclysmic flood.

319
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,580
 You may have thought that the Grand Canyon was formed

320
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,860
 by the Colorado River slowly cutting into it.

321
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,060
 Some people still believe that, but a theory

322
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,740
 that is gaining credibility is that it was actually

323
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:40,460
 caused by a cataclysmic flood, not just the Grand Canyon,

324
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,740
 but also Devil's Tower in Wyoming, Monument Valley in Utah,

325
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,060
 and Bryce Canyon in Utah, okay?

326
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,680
 This is one of the leading theories out there right now

327
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,680
 that, hey, these canyons were cut by rapid rushing water.

328
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,780
 Biologists have found oceanic fossils on mountaintops.

329
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,780
 Recently, they have found whales on the tops of mountains,

330
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,560
 nowhere near the ocean.

331
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
 How did they get there?

332
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,500
 Let me tell you how they didn't get there.

333
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,460
 Somebody wasn't like, well, my pet whale died.

334
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,060
 Let me haul it up this mountain, right,

335
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,900
 and bury it, pet cemetery up here.

336
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,660
 No, that's not what happened, okay?

337
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,700
 Think worldwide flood.

338
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,760
 Many believe that a worldwide flood gives the Earth

339
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,080
 the appearance of age, that it's actually a young Earth,

340
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,440
 but scientists have said, well, if the Earth was

341
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,980
 at one point covered with water,

342
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,360
 that could skew the results of carbon dating.

343
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
 Oh, I said that, biologists have found fossils

344
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,200
 on mountaintops.

345
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,520
 There are over 150 global flood stories

346
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,360
 from ancient civilizations.

347
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,320
 That include a man who was favored,

348
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,380
 who built a vessel to protect him and his family.

349
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,080
 What this means is you go into the jungles of Brazil,

350
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,440
 the jungles of Africa, and you meet

351
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,440
 with Indian civilizations, and they tell you,

352
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
 or native civilizations, and they tell you,

353
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,200
 hey, we, you know, our ancestors have told us this story

354
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,280
 over and over and over about a man

355
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,160
 when the Earth flooded and he was protected

356
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,780
 because he built a boat.

357
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,020
 The flood would have changed everything.

358
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,680
 The flood would have changed everything,

359
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,220
 the climate, the atmosphere.

360
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,920
 I personally believe it had never rained prior to the flood.

361
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,780
 I believe the Bible supports that.

362
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,040
 The Bible says that there was this umbrella of water

363
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,120
 in the sky, that when God separated the water in the sky

364
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,760
 and the Earth, that there was this kind of ozone layer

365
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,040
 or this atmosphere that protected us

366
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,760
 from the sun's radiation.

367
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,440
 I believe that's why that you see this fault line

368
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,240
 in the Bible that at one moment,

369
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,520
 they lived like 1,000 years,

370
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,680
 and the next moment after the flood,

371
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
 after it had rained for the first time,

372
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,320
 people began to die younger and younger and younger

373
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,960
 and younger and younger.

374
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,400
 All right?

375
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,320
 The atmosphere as we know it changed,

376
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,640
 the climate changed, the umbrella of water changed,

377
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,280
 the waters burst forth from above and below,

378
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,800
 the Scripture says.

379
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,500
 And some people say, "Well, what about dinosaurs?

380
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,340
 "What about dinosaurs?

381
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,180
 "Were they on the Ark?"

382
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,860
 I don't know.

383
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,960
 Maybe, maybe little ones, maybe eggs.

384
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,840
 I don't know, but let me ask you a question.

385
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,480
 Did you know, did you know that reptiles

386
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,640
 grow their entire lives?

387
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,720
 Different than mammals.

388
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 Mammals hit a max height and then plateau or even decline.

389
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,640
 Reptiles, they grow their entire existence.

390
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,040
 This is one of the reasons they shed their skin.

391
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,560
 And so if at this time,

392
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,960
 under this protected umbrella of an ozone layer,

393
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,280
 people and things live up to 1,000 years old,

394
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,080
 how big would an iguana be?

395
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,560
 Did you know the first dinosaur they ever discovered,

396
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,840
 this was what was said about it.

397
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,080
 It looked like a 30-foot long iguana.

398
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,600
 You know what they named it?

399
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,800
 Creatively, Iguanodon.

400
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,440
 Here's a picture of it.

401
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,700
 Artist rendering of the first dinosaur they ever discovered.

402
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,080
 Because if things lived thousands of years,

403
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,200
 then snakes and iguanas and lizards and crocodiles

404
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,920
 would continue to grow for thousands of years.

405
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,260
 They would be huge.

406
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,880
 Where are dinosaurs today?

407
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,980
 Look at your pet iguana.

408
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,180
 (congregation laughing)

409
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,800
 Let's talk about facts about the ark,

410
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,000
 if you're still with me.

411
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,020
 The ark would have been roughly 427 feet long.

412
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,680
 That's about a football field and a half.

413
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,860
 95 feet wide and 75 feet high.

414
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,340
 You might be thinking, JP, that's awesome.

415
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,180
 You know what?

416
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,020
 With all of these details,

417
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,500
 I'm gonna become a billionaire and build one.

418
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,260
 You would not be the first person.

419
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,280
 Lots of people have built arks, okay?

420
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,500
 I'll show you a few.

421
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 There's one.

422
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,540
 There's another one.

423
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,100
 There's another one and another one and yet one more.

424
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,760
 This one specifically is traveling from Norway to Brazil.

425
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,000
 These are made life-size.

426
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
 You see that?

427
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
 That's a life-size giraffe there on top

428
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
 and an elephant as well.

429
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,060
 Somebody spent millions and millions of dollars

430
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,080
 building an ark replica.

431
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,180
 Okay, could it fit all of the animals?

432
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,760
 Miley Cyrus would tell you no.

433
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,200
 There would need to be between 16 and 50,000 animals

434
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,300
 on this ark.

435
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,780
 Between 16,000 and 50,000, that's a big discrepancy.

436
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,700
 Let's go with the extremely high number of 50,000.

437
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,660
 There would have been two of every kind, okay?

438
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,040
 Here's what that word means in the Hebrew

439
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,320
 where it says kind.

440
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,520
 This word is very important.

441
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,680
 What does it mean two of every kind?

442
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,080
 It means two kinds of dogs.

443
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,400
 It doesn't mean two dachshunds and two Dobermans.

444
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,040
 It means two dogs, okay?

445
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,240
 Not a dachshund, two dachshunds and two wolves,

446
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,680
 two dingoes, two coyotes.

447
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,520
 No, just two kinds of dogs, not two species of dogs.

448
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,040
 See, here's the way that you would define kind

449
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
 as it's defined here.

450
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,920
 Animals that can procreate, okay?

451
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,840
 A horse and a cow cannot breed and make babies, okay?

452
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,180
 It's never happened.

453
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:38,080
 But different species of cows can breed and have babies.

454
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,320
 Different kinds of horses can breed and have babies, right?

455
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,360
 Different kinds of dogs, even a dachshund and a wolf

456
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,520
 can have babies, so every kind of dog comes from two.

457
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,680
 This is important to understand this, right?

458
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,720
 And so the average size would have been a,

459
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,000
 ready for it, sheep.

460
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,400
 90% of all the animals in the animal kingdom,

461
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,120
 90% are smaller than a sheep.

462
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
 So let's do some math real quick, if you're still with me.

463
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,880
 240 sheep fit on a railroad livestock car.

464
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
 That's how we transport them today.

465
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,240
 So it would have taken 208 railroad cars

466
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,240
 to get 50,000 animals across the water, if you will, 208.

467
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,660
 Could 208 railroad cars fit on the ark?

468
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,660
 No, 549 could have.

469
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:39,300
 It would have only taken 36% of the ark,

470
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,680
 according to the size that it was built in the scripture,

471
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,480
 to hold two of every kind of animal.

472
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,180
 And assuming that Noah worked 52 weeks of year,

473
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,860
 six days a week, taking one off for rest,

474
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,500
 experts calculate that he would need

475
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,500
 81 years to complete the ark.

476
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,300
 He had 120 years and three sons,

477
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,020
 whose only chores were to build a giant boat.

478
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,760
 (congregation laughing)

479
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,580
 And so you may ask, hey, how did the animals get there?

480
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,580
 How did Noah get all the animals on the boat?

481
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,420
 Here's how.

482
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,600
 God brought 'em.

483
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
 That's it.

484
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
 Like if you wanna scrutinize something in the story,

485
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,080
 all of those other things, I can logically get you there.

486
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,600
 How did all the animals get there?

487
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,640
 God had to supernaturally intervene.

488
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,800
 And if you got an issue with that,

489
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,480
 let me tell you another story about a man who died,

490
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,400
 lived in a grave for three days, and then rose from the dead.

491
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,800
 And when I say lived in the grave,

492
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,100
 I don't mean lived in the grave, I mean dead in the grave

493
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,120
 for three days and then rose from the dead.

494
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,840
 And so if you've got a problem with Noah,

495
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,240
 you've got a problem with Jesus.

496
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,080
 And so how did the animals get to the ark?

497
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,200
 This is simple.

498
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,080
 God brought them to him.

499
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 It's the only way anybody gets to God.

500
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
 He grabs them and turns them and moves them to himself.

501
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,320
 That's how you got here, man.

502
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,680
 In the same way that you walked through those doors tonight,

503
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,080
 that's how those animals got on the ark.

504
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,720
 God brought them.

505
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
 I pray for you every week

506
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
 that he would bring everyone here,

507
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,240
 that he wants to be here.

508
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,480
 So let's talk about the significance of Noah's story.

509
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,020
 The significance of Noah's story.

510
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,560
 God tells Noah to build an ark

511
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,420
 because he is going to destroy the world.

512
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,280
 This is heavy.

513
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,360
 It's not like a nursery mural, okay?

514
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,380
 Forget the animated man with a big smile on his face.

515
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,160
 No, all his friends are about to die.

516
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,320
 It's much more like the painting

517
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,680
 of a man named Gustav Dore called "The Deluge."

518
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,320
 I can't show it to you.

519
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,780
 It's much too graphic.

520
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,520
 Let me just describe it to you.

521
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,320
 The floodwaters come up.

522
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,360
 There's arms and legs flailing in the water

523
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,720
 as people drown.

524
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,360
 And there's a man next to a giant boulder

525
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,780
 who hoist his three-year-old up onto a rock

526
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,900
 as his wife sits up there,

527
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,640
 as vultures who are tired from feasting

528
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,900
 on the flesh of humans circle above.

529
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,760
 And on that rock, as this man chooses,

530
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,380
 do I let my child drown or possibly be devoured?

531
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,220
 On that rock is a giant tiger hovering above.

532
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,400
 That's the flood.

533
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,140
 It ain't no nursery rhyme, man.

534
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,340
 It's heavy.

535
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,180
 It's heavy.

536
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,340
 Gotta feel that.

537
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,940
 And Noah obeys as others mock his obedience,

538
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,520
 as he's grieved at the horrible sounds

539
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,620
 of people screaming outside,

540
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,620
 the disgusting smell of rotted flesh floating all about.

541
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,020
 Noah trusted God when no one else did.

542
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,220
 And in Genesis chapter seven, verse four,

543
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,260
 it says he shuts the door to the ark.

544
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,380
 And do you know what happens?

545
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,500
 His family and all the animals get on the ark.

546
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,340
 He shuts the door.

547
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,580
 Do you know what happens?

548
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,460
 Ready?

549
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,720
 Nothing.

550
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,480
 Nothing.

551
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,740
 For seven days.

552
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,960
 Dude.

553
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,800
 He's on there with his wife.

554
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 Do you remember last week when I said

555
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,220
 her desire will be for her husband's job?

556
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,240
 Can you imagine for a moment,

557
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,040
 he's on that ark, shuts the door,

558
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,300
 and seven day, I mean, sun up, sun goes down,

559
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,560
 nothing happens.

560
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,740
 Noah, honey?

561
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,020
 (congregation laughing)

562
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,580
 Are you sure he didn't say build a park?

563
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,100
 Or buy some art?

564
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,780
 I mean, are you sure, baby,

565
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,260
 that you understood him correctly?

566
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,340
 You ever waited on God?

567
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,260
 You ever did everything you were supposed to do

568
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,620
 and it seemed like he didn't show up?

569
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,260
 And you sat there and you waited.

570
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,840
 But on the seventh day, it began to rain.

571
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 And it rained for 40 days and 40 nights.

572
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,640
 But if I can't swim after four, anyways.

573
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,460
 Waters fell from the sky and it says

574
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,420
 they gushed forward from below.

575
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,540
 And it says Noah walked with God.

576
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,940
 He did everything the Lord commanded him.

577
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,620
 Genesis chapter seven, verse five.

578
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,840
 Noah trusted God.

579
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,740
 He was on the ark for one year.

580
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,620
 And he did what God asked,

581
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,380
 and so God made another promise.

582
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,180
 And it's called the Noahic covenant.

583
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,780
 So God made another covenant with Noah,

584
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,620
 and I'll read it to you.

585
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,320
 It's Genesis chapter nine, verses 11 through 15.

586
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,340
 I established my covenant with you.

587
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,100
 Never again will all life be destroyed

588
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,460
 by the waters of a flood.

589
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,420
 Never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.

590
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,720
 And God said, this is the sign of the covenant

591
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,700
 I am making between me and you

592
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,420
 and every living creature with you.

593
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,620
 A covenant for all generations to come.

594
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,260
 I have set my rainbow in the clouds

595
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,540
 and it will be the sign of the covenant

596
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,140
 between me and the earth.

597
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,940
 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth

598
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,020
 and the rainbow appears in the clouds,

599
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,000
 I will remember my covenant between me and you

600
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,700
 and all living creatures of every kind.

601
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,340
 Never again will the waters become a flood

602
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,120
 to destroy all life.

603
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,060
 And imagine if God hadn't given us this sign.

604
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,260
 Every single time it would rain, we would be terrified.

605
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,820
 Every time it rained, we would be looking for a boat,

606
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,820
 be looking for some sort of refuge.

607
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,540
 But we have this Noahic covenant which says this,

608
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,680
 be fruitful and increase in number.

609
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,740
 It says that a part of, I'm gonna go through

610
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,200
 the parts of the Noahic covenant.

611
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,480
 Be fruitful and increase in number.

612
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,900
 God gives animals the fear of man,

613
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,260
 which is interesting that that's even in there.

614
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,460
 And it's so true, like think about it.

615
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,940
 I mean, I grew up on a farm, okay?

616
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,380
 I did, I know that's crazy.

617
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
 Red pants and a straw hat, I did though.

618
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,980
 And so there I am and I remember one night we were camping

619
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,980
 and I would hear like coyotes in the distance

620
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,940
 and I'd be afraid and my parents would tell me,

621
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,260
 hey, they're more afraid of you than you are them.

622
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,400
 It turns out that's biblical.

623
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,240
 That's absolutely true.

624
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,580
 I remember being in 4-H, walking this 1200 pound steer

625
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,160
 around a ring that was afraid of me.

626
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,260
 A 1200 pound animal afraid of me.

627
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,500
 I was like all but 75 pounds.

628
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,060
 You know, wet and this guy is afraid of me

629
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,540
 because God has given animals the fear of man.

630
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,920
 Animals are provided as food.

631
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,960
 So you can be a vegan on principle but not by religion.

632
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,580
 Okay, 'cause God has given us filet mignon.

633
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,860
 It's a gift from him.

634
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,660
 (congregation laughing)

635
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,760
 Anyone who murders a human will be brought to justice

636
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,720
 because humans are made in God's image.

637
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,800
 And God will not destroy the world by flood again.

638
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,440
 He will never use flood or waters

639
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,340
 as a weapon of mass destruction

640
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,560
 and he gives us this sign known as the rainbow.

641
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,160
 And so God provided a way to save his chosen people

642
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,460
 in a what?

643
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,100
 What did Noah build?

644
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,660
 Who knows what an ark is?

645
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,900
 How would you define an ark

646
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,300
 when you came in here this evening?

647
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,460
 A giant boat?

648
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,620
 An ark is not a boat.

649
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,320
 In fact, if you look up ark in Webster's dictionary,

650
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,160
 the only reason we even define ark as a big boat

651
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,780
 is because of this man Noah.

652
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,840
 You know what an ark is?

653
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,180
 An ark is a protective container.

654
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,380
 A protective container, that's what an ark is.

655
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,820
 Think of the Ark of the Covenant

656
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,020
 if you know your Bible, right?

657
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,500
 Though an ark is a protective container.

658
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,600
 God asked Noah to build a protective container.

659
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,420
 What's the difference between that and a boat?

660
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:13,180
 An ark has no propulsion, no rudder, no steering wheel.

661
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
 It just floats.

662
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,460
 It can't go anywhere.

663
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,380
 It is completely and fully at the mercy of God.

664
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,100
 Do you know the ark didn't have any windows

665
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,580
 except for above?

666
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,780
 The only thing that Noah could see was the sky.

667
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,320
 He had to completely trust that God would at some point

668
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,140
 in these hundred years dry up the water.

669
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,300
 And if Noah looked out and he did see land,

670
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,540
 he'd have no way to get to it.

671
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,500
 It's not like he could turn the ark on and drive over there.

672
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,420
 He just had to wait for that land to come to him.

673
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,060
 There's nothing he could do

674
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,900
 but sit in the protective covering of God.

675
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,420
 He had to trust fully.

676
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,300
 Guys, can I tell you something?

677
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,980
 You know what you want in life?

678
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,960
 A lot of you, you want what I wanted for a long time.

679
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
 You want control.

680
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,480
 You wanna sit at the steering wheel

681
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,120
 and you wanna control your life

682
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,480
 but you're not in control of your life.

683
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,960
 You'll never be in control of your life.

684
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,240
 You're like, yes, I am, JP.

685
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,680
 I could leave right now if I want to.

686
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
 You can leave until God touched your heart

687
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,260
 and gives you cardiac arrest or brain aneurysm

688
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,180
 or swipes your legs out from under you at his will.

689
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,360
 You're not in control.

690
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,540
 I've seen this play out beautifully with my kids.

691
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,880
 When my daughter Presley was Weston's age,

692
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,220
 when she was about three years old,

693
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,280
 just a little toddler, we would go to the store

694
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,520
 and we would get in those grocery carts.

695
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,800
 Have you seen those grocery carts

696
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,360
 with the car on the front,

697
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,080
 kind of truck on the front and the steering wheel?

698
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,920
 Have you seen this?

699
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,800
 I don't know if you have, if you're not a parent

700
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,760
 but it's a big thing in our house, right?

701
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,360
 'Cause she always wants to get that car.

702
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,020
 Like, daddy, let me sit in the front

703
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,280
 and we'll play this game at the grocery store.

704
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,400
 I'm pushing the cart and she's driving.

705
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,880
 She's sitting in the front of that cart

706
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,280
 at the little steering wheel

707
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,860
 and she'll steer right and I'll take us right

708
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,880
 and she'll steer left and I'll take us left.

709
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,360
 I will make her think that she is driving.

710
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,800
 It was awesome.

711
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
 And I would go wherever she'd go.

712
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,720
 Like, she'd crash in the apples.

713
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,160
 I mean, apples are coming down.

714
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,560
 Like, I would just convince her, like, you are in control.

715
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,960
 She'd go right, I'd go right.

716
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,360
 She'd go left, I'd go left.

717
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
 And she was just in control.

718
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,600
 And sooner or later, she would steer right and I'd go left.

719
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,820
 And I'd watch her, I'd watch her.

720
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,320
 Just like you and me, she'd grip that wheel

721
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,880
 and she'd struggle.

722
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,920
 I'm turning right, right.

723
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,200
 And I'm like, left.

724
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,360
 Because I had stuff I needed to do.

725
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,320
 I had an agenda, right?

726
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,040
 I couldn't play the game forever.

727
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,680
 And it became this, really, listen to me.

728
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,680
 It became this really powerful metaphor in my life

729
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
 that my control is an illusion of God's will.

730
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
 Sometimes I steer right and he takes me right.

731
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,360
 Sometimes I steer left and he takes me left.

732
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,240
 But sometimes I steer right and he takes me left.

733
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,340
 And he just says, JP, I've got stuff I gotta do, man.

734
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,400
 And I need you to trust me right now.

735
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,240
 We had fun, you playing that little game,

736
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,260
 thinking you were in control.

737
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,160
 But JP, you're not in control.

738
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,280
 I'm in control.

739
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,520
 You're not God.

740
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,280
 He's God.

741
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,360
 Noah's at the mercy of God on this boat

742
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,560
 with no rudder, no propulsion, no propeller,

743
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,740
 no steering wheel.

744
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:39,540
 So guys, if you hadn't caught on to this powerful picture

745
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,960
 of what this is, Noah made a way of salvation

746
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,400
 out of a wooden structure.

747
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,480
 And anyone who trusted in this wooden structure

748
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,840
 would be saved as God washed away the sins of the world

749
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,920
 as his wrath came down from heaven, okay?

750
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,320
 His wrath, the very thing that came down from heaven,

751
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,000
 it lifted up the ark, this thing that Noah built in faith

752
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,840
 and this protective covering, and it protected him.

753
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,460
 And likewise, Jesus goes to a cross,

754
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,180
 a protective covering for you, making it for you

755
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,480
 that you would stand against the culture of the world,

756
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,200
 the currents of this culture,

757
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,880
 and you would be protected by this container,

758
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,160
 a covering of the blood of Jesus Christ,

759
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,040
 his provision, making atonement for your sins,

760
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,160
 a substitutionary payment for your sins,

761
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,800
 that that happened through Christ.

762
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,880
 Noah's a type of Christ pointing to Jesus,

763
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,280
 that as God's wrath came down, now on the cross,

764
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,200
 now on his son, that you're protected.

765
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,520
 See, God would deal with sin again.

766
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,300
 He would wash away the sins of the world again.

767
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,940
 But this time, it wouldn't be humans who were crushed.

768
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,060
 It would be one human who was crushed,

769
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,320
 and that human was fully God, a fully man,

770
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,420
 in the form of Jesus Christ.

771
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:11,100
 And can I tell you something?

772
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,820
 If you've trusted in the cross,

773
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,340
 the cross has no steering wheel.

774
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,300
 The cross has no rudder, the cross has no propeller,

775
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,180
 the cross has no propulsion.

776
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:26,180
 The cross is carrying you safely into the presence of God

777
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,800
 on its timing, on God's schedule.

778
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,380
 And as you move through this world,

779
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,460
 you cling tightly to the cross.

780
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,020
 It's all you've got.

781
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,340
 You think you've got other things.

782
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,240
 You don't, man, it can be washed away.

783
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,980
 You got the cross.

784
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,640
 100 years from now, it's the cross and nothing else.

785
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,740
 That's what you got.

786
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,860
 And so Noah preserved humanity selflessly, right?

787
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,100
 He wanted to save himself.

788
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,500
 Christ preserved humanity selflessly.

789
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,260
 He crushed himself on your behalf.

790
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,540
 In fact, 2 Peter 3, verse three through seven says this.

791
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,580
 Above all, you must understand that in the last days,

792
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,660
 scoffers will come scoffing

793
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,400
 and following their own evil desires.

794
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,160
 They will say, where is this coming he promised?

795
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,720
 Ever since our ancestors died,

796
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,180
 everything goes on as it has

797
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,420
 since the beginning of creation.

798
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,420
 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word,

799
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,780
 the heavens came into being

800
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,100
 and the earth was formed out of water and by water.

801
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,580
 And these same waters,

802
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,340
 also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.

803
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,860
 By the same word, the present heavens and earth

804
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,980
 are reserved for fire now,

805
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,300
 being kept for the day of judgment

806
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,120
 and destruction of the ungodly.

807
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,700
 Guys, judgment's coming again, man.

808
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,800
 And so my last and final point,

809
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,980
 last thing I wanna talk about

810
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,960
 is the application of Noah's story.

811
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,460
 Application of Noah's story.

812
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,420
 Christian, if you're here, follower of Jesus Christ,

813
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,220
 if you're here, you've identified with Jesus

814
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,700
 through his death and resurrection,

815
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,260
 you stand firm in the scoffing.

816
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,660
 Others are gonna make fun of you.

817
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,260
 They're gonna ask you why you do the things

818
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,020
 you do, why you don't spend the money,

819
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,620
 your money the way they do,

820
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,220
 why you don't go and get drunk the way they do

821
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,980
 or go and have sex the way they do,

822
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,300
 why you don't date the way they do,

823
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,540
 why you don't work the way they do.

824
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
 You stand firm in the scoffing, friend.

825
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,340
 Stand firm.

826
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,140
 Stand against evil.

827
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,140
 My friend who passed away in the past couple of years,

828
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,700
 he just talked about what we're in

829
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,580
 and called it the spiral of silence.

830
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,740
 That Christians aren't standing up against what is evil.

831
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,360
 We're just going on about our day, silent.

832
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,980
 Secondly, you faithfully do all that God asks of you.

833
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,820
 Do you hear me?

834
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,140
 Faithfully do everything God asks of you.

835
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,180
 Some of you, you're here and you're like, man, JP,

836
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,420
 if God asked me to go to Africa, I'd be there, man.

837
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,500
 I would go.

838
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,780
 I'd be buying my plane ticket one way even, bro.

839
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,460
 And I'm like, that's awesome, man.

840
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,020
 What if he asked you to a life of celibacy?

841
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,260
 Same excitement.

842
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,820
 What if he called you to purity?

843
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,020
 Are you still obeying?

844
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,380
 What if he called you to a life of sobriety?

845
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,700
 Are you still all in?

846
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,220
 Africa?

847
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,760
 Haiti even?

848
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,140
 Celibacy.

849
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,780
 What if he called you to singleness?

850
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,140
 You okay with that?

851
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,900
 You okay?

852
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,940
 You're like, God, I trust you.

853
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,420
 If that's what you want from me, man,

854
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,060
 I'll serve you as a single man or woman

855
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,940
 the rest of my life.

856
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,900
 You good with that?

857
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,740
 God's people respond to God's commands in obedience.

858
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,620
 We don't get drunk on wine like the Scriptures say.

859
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,460
 We don't lust after things that don't belong to us

860
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,300
 like the Scriptures say.

861
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,100
 We care for the poor around us.

862
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,040
 Okay, we're generous.

863
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,820
 What if he calls you to generosity?

864
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,160
 We don't desire riches.

865
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,300
 Let me say that again, okay, in case you fell asleep.

866
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,200
 We don't desire riches, 1 Timothy 6, verse nine.

867
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,820
 We use words to build up, not to tear down.

868
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,840
 Ephesians 4, verse 29.

869
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,500
 We don't worry, Matthew 6, but instead we trust God.

870
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,380
 And we show others the way.

871
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,400
 You show others the way.

872
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,120
 One time when I was younger, I was touring a church.

873
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,620
 We were taking a tour of a church.

874
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,600
 And they pointed to the roof and they said,

875
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
 "Hey, we want you to notice something.

876
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
 "The roof was like Noah's Ark."

877
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,900
 And they said, in fact, this, they said,

878
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,040
 "Many roofs are made like Noah's Ark."

879
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,160
 Here's a picture of one.

880
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,580
 I just Googled this one, right?

881
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,360
 "Many roofs of churches are made to look like Noah's Ark."

882
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,400
 They said, "We want to be a refuge

883
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
 "from the people of our culture to come into

884
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200
 "and be saved, that they would trust

885
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,360
 "in the finished work of Jesus Christ and be saved.

886
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,760
 "We want to be salt and light.

887
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,420
 "We want to preserve the ideologies of Christianity,

888
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,960
 "of Jesus Christ, of the one true God."

889
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,300
 And so we call people to him.

890
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,660
 You are like Noah.

891
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,740
 Hey, come and be saved.

892
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,820
 Come here, accept God's grace,

893
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,100
 walk with the Lord in obedience to him,

894
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,660
 and call others to the Lord,

895
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,780
 others to the Lord's provision of grace, right?

896
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,740
 Second Peter chapter two, verse five says

897
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,860
 that Noah was a preacher of righteousness.

898
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,540
 I believe that Noah did this, but no one came.

899
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,500
 But you spend your life, Noah spent his entire life,

900
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,300
 every waking day, walking in obedience to God.

901
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,780
 What if that's your epitaph, man?

902
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,300
 What if that's your tombstone?

903
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,020
 What was she like?

904
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,940
 Well, she was righteous and blameless,

905
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
 and she walked with God.

906
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:10,860
 The end, if that's all anything anybody ever says of you,

907
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,220
 praise be to God.

908
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,100
 That is an amazing epitaph.

909
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,940
 That's an incredible testimony.

910
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,540
 And so friend, if you're here tonight,

911
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,260
 and you haven't responded yet,

912
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,240
 I need to tell you about God's judgment.

913
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,400
 It's coming.

914
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,540
 He's going to judge every deed you've done,

915
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,860
 everything you've thought, and every word you've spoken,

916
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,220
 things you did all by yourself that no one will ever know

917
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:00,220
 but God knows, unless you trust in Jesus Christ

918
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,020
 as a payment for your sins,

919
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,500
 that Jesus died in your place, a substitute.

920
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,700
 He died the death that you deserve

921
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,300
 so that you can live the life that he deserves,

922
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,760
 being a perfect son of God.

923
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,460
 It is your only chance.

924
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,820
 Get on the ark!

925
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,580
 Get on the ark!

926
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,940
 It's the only shot you have.

927
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,220
 Cling to the cross, it's your only hope.

928
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,420
 You wanna live, it's your only hope.

929
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,660
 It's the only chance you have to live.

930
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,540
 You cling to the cross of Jesus Christ.

931
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,620
 You trust in his death and resurrection

932
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,180
 for the forgiveness of all your sins

933
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,940
 that they've been wiped away,

934
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,580
 that they've been paid for.

935
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,500
 It's your only strategy.

936
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,900
 It's your only chance.

937
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,140
 It's your only hope.

938
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,280
 There was judgment in the flood when the waters came down.

939
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,020
 And the only thing that separated the people,

940
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,900
 you say, "But what about the people that died?"

941
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,500
 The only thing that separated those people from hell

942
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,380
 was more days of unrighteousness.

943
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,380
 God only expedited that for them.

944
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,800
 God only saved them from more violence, more condemnation.

945
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,460
 That's what a righteous, just God did.

946
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,940
 And there was judgment on the cross.

947
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,580
 That God's wrath came down on Jesus,

948
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,740
 that Jesus makes a way for people into heaven,

949
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,480
 and that judgment will come after the scoffers.

950
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,880
 Jesus, when he was on the earth, said this,

951
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,060
 and I'll wrap up.

952
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,400
 Matthew 24, verse 36.

953
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,460
 But about that day or hour, no one knows,

954
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,900
 not even the angels in heaven or the Son,

955
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,040
 but only the Father.

956
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,540
 As it was in the days of Noah,

957
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,900
 so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

958
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,460
 For in the days before the flood,

959
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,500
 people were eating and drinking,

960
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,740
 marrying and giving in marriage.

961
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,860
 Up to the day Noah entered the ark,

962
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,020
 and they knew nothing about what would happen

963
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,180
 until the flood came and took them all away.

964
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,980
 And that is how it will be,

965
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,460
 at the coming of the Son of Man.

966
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,900
 He says there'll be a bride and a groom,

967
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,820
 and there'll be, you know,

968
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,780
 for richer or poorer till death do us.

969
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,740
 [shushing]

970
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,940
 Didn't see that coming.

971
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,860
 Well, that's because you didn't listen

972
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,260
 to my friends at the porch.

973
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,020
 When they went to work and they pleaded with you.

974
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,420
 When they begged you to repent.

975
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,380
 When they shared these truths with you,

976
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,880
 you didn't see that coming

977
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,040
 because you didn't listen to them,

978
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,700
 or they didn't share faithfully.

979
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,660
 That's why you didn't see it coming.

980
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,660
 In summary, the evidence supports this happened.

981
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,300
 The significant of Noah's story

982
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,140
 is that it points us to Christ.

983
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,900
 And the application for you and me is to do

984
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,700
 as Noah did, and trust God.

985
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,340
 And I told you that God would be good in this.

986
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,340
 This story in here ends,

987
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,540
 I didn't read the last sentence.

988
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,380
 It says this,

989
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,660
 "God's strong anger against hate and sadness and death

990
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,420
 "would come down once more,

991
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,260
 "but not on his people or his world, no.

992
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,900
 "God's war bow, the rainbow,

993
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,020
 "was not pointing down at his people.

994
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,420
 "It was pointing up into the heart of heaven."

995
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,940
 And I read that and I was like, oh, that's cute.

996
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,220
 Sally Lloyd-Jones kind of finished it with that.

997
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,060
 And then I studied the Hebrew,

998
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,140
 and the word here for rainbow is kasheth.

999
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:57,380
 It's God's weapon of destruction.

1000
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:02,180
 It is a weapon that they would use in battle.

1001
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,820
 And God didn't hang it in the sky like a U.

1002
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,820
 He hung it in the sky, pointing up at him,

1003
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,820
 saying the next time my wrath will come down on sin,

1004
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,340
 it will not be on you, friends, it will be on me.

1005
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,060
 That's my plan.

1006
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,060
 Since the beginning of time,

1007
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,940
 that God's kasheth, his war bow,

1008
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,220
 is pointed in heaven.

1009
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,940
 When you see that thing, Fort Worth,

1010
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,180
 when you saw that last week,

1011
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:45,180
 you remember God's promises, that he loves you,

1012
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,940
 and he's never gonna judge the world again by water,

1013
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,580
 but judgment is coming, this time by fire.

1014
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,620
 Call people to the ark.

1015
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,380
 Call people to the cross.

1016
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,220
 Let me pray.

1017
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:12,140
 Father in heaven, thank you for the faithfulness of Noah.

1018
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,060
 Thank you for the example that you've given us

1019
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,780
 and a man who spent every day of his life

1020
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,740
 really building this thing

1021
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,060
 that you would use to protect and preserve humanity,

1022
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,020
 this ancestor of ours, of all of ours, Noah.

1023
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,180
 Father, out of the room tonight,

1024
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,020
 would you make men and women who are like Noah,

1025
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,020
 who would faithfully walk with you, stand against scoffing,

1026
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,100
 share the truth that others need to get on the ark

1027
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,580
 after having trusted in the cross themselves.

1028
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,220
 Would you do that in us?

1029
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,740
 In Jesus' name, amen.
