1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 As I went down in the river to pray, Studying about that good old way,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And who shall wear the starry crown, Good Lord, show me the way.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 O sinners, let's go down, Let's go down, don't you want to come down?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 O sinners, let's go down, Down in the river to pray.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Porch, we really believe those words that we're singing.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Like we genuinely believe that there's no place better to be than to be near God.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And so what we're doing tonight is we're flipping the script.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 We're taking the entire service of how we normally run things,

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 and we are turning it on its head because as we've been journeying through the series that we've been doing here,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 a series called Revive, which I'll tell you a little bit more about in a minute,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 what we know is that often if we want more of God, exactly what John Mark just said,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 he wants more of us in return.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 And so we want to clear space on the back end of tonight to worship him together,

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 to respond rightly and really to the God that we long to be near to.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And so I'm going to pray for us, and then we're going to go right into the word,

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 and we're going to go and teach this evening, and then we're going to let the truth of God's scripture,

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 not my ideas, not my thoughts, but the truth of his word,

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 lead us to a place where we respond appropriately.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So let me pray for us real quick.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 God, we love you, and it's crazy to even say that.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 How, God, could we, an unrighteous and an unholy and a sin-filled people,

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 ever dare say we love you?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And the reason is, Lord, is because you have first loved us.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 You have made such a reality possible.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 And so, God, what we know is that there is not a single person here by happenstance.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It doesn't matter where we are on our spectrum of spirituality,

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 whether we have known you all our life, we recently came to know you,

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 or, God, we don't know you, nor do we want to.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 If you are who you say you are, which, Jesus, we know is the truth,

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 then there's not a person here tonight that is here coincidentally.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 You have something, God, that you want to teach to every single person.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And I'm asking you, porch, as you're listening to me pray right now,

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 take my word for it.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Like, what is it going to cost you to just lean into the possibility

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 that God has something for you right now?

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I want to give you a chance to pray for yourself.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Take a moment and just ask, God, God, would you speak to me?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Maybe you're here and you don't know him.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 What's it going to hurt you to pray that prayer and ask anyways?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So take a moment and pray for yourself.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And then I want to ask you, if you would, would you pray for me?

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Would you ask the Lord would speak through me?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 That it wouldn't be my voice you hear, it would be his truth you hear,

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 that it wouldn't be my thoughts you walk away with,

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 it would be his word you walk away with.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Would you take a moment and would you pray for me?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Well, Father, we need you tonight.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 But not only that, just as we prayed, we want you tonight.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 We want you here, Jesus.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Come have your way amongst us, we pray in your name.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Amen.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 You can go ahead and grab a seat.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Well, Porch, how are we doing tonight?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 We doing okay?

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Great to see you.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Thanks for making the time to join us this evening.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I know we've got some new faces in the room.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So thanks for giving us your Tuesday night.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And thanks to not only those of you in the room,

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 but all of our Porch Live locations tuning in this evening

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 or at a different evening in the future.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Special shout out to Porch Live Dayton, Fort Worth, and Wheaton.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Well, several years ago, Brooke, my wife, and I were living in Houston, Texas,

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 whenever Snowmageddon struck our great state.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Do you remember Snowmageddon, the snowpocalypse?

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Now, before our northern friends join us for using such a dramatic name

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 for a winter weather event such as this, you need to know a couple of things

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 because this was not any ordinary winter weather event.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 You see, this winter weather event actually impacted every single county

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 in the Lone Star State.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And not only that, it left over 10 million people without power.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Anybody lose power because of this thing back in 2021?

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Show of hands in here.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Yeah, it was widespread and massively impactful.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And yet, we knew it was coming.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 We knew in Houston that we were no exception to this specific storm.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And so we prepared ourselves.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 We watched the forecast.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 We made sure to batten down the hatches.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 We pulled out our ski gear because we knew we might need it.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And yet, despite the fact that we felt really prepared for this storm

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 that was heading in, we decided to start second-guessing our choices

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 whenever we realized that our thermostat internally was dropping

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 from 72 to 65 to 58 to 50 degrees.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 It was in that moment that we started questioning our life choices.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And we decided we need a change of scenery.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Fortunate for us, my parents had power, which meant they had heat.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 But unfortunate for us, my parents lived four hours away.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And the distance between us and them was covered by ice-in roadways

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 and snow-covered highways.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 So we knew we had a journey if we wanted to get there.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So what did we do?

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 We took our chances, okay?

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 We decided to load up my wife's Ford Escape,

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 and we made the journey across the state of Texas.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Now, a shout-out to anybody that drives a Ford Escape in here.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 That is a strong and sturdy vehicle because it had no business being on those roads,

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 but it actually made the drive.

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 We found ourselves traversing a winter wonderland of sorts

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 and making really good headway.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Like, the beginning of the drive, we really enjoyed ourselves.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Like, man, we were talking about things that we hadn't caught up in a while,

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 and we were taking in all of the scenery,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and we were listening to whatever murder mystery podcast was popular at the time.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But about an hour away from our destination,

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 things started to get a little bit dicey.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 We realized, man, the snow's really piling up.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Our tires are slipping around.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We're not getting good traction any longer.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 The visibility from our front windshield and back windshield

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 was getting worse and worse and worse.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And it was in that moment, as a young husband,

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 that I began to panic internally.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I didn't show it to my wife, but I began to worry for our safety.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And yet, like an answer from heaven,

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 behind me, through the blizzard,

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 came the headlights of one massive Mack truck,

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 just peeling forward, plowing snow out of the way,

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and actually heading the exact direction we went.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And it struck me in that moment.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I guess even angels drive 18-wheelers,

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 because we took our car and we ducked in right behind that truck.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You see, in that moment, the presence of that truck

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 changed everything for us.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 It moved the needle in a way that we could not move on our own any longer.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And so we found, as we kind of fell in line behind it

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 and we rolled within its wake,

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 that we started regaining traction, the traction that we had lost before.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 We started finding new visibility,

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 because as long as we could see it, we could see where we were going.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And the fact of the matter was, we made up time that we had lost previously.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 The presence of that truck changed everything for us.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So long as we were close to it, we got closer to our destination.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Now, why do I tell you that?

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Because in this life, everybody,

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 regardless of your religious background or your socioeconomic status

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 or your political affiliation or your ethnicity

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 or your job position or your social influence,

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 regardless of who you are,

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 we are all seeking the same destination.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 We're all seeking flourishing.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 We all want fulfillment and happiness and satisfaction.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 The difference between those that seek it and those that find it

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 is whether or not you find one whose presence can make the difference.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You see, there are a lot of us that are not just journeying through this life,

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 but are journeying here right now in a way where, man,

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 we're trying to do it on our own.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 We're walking around and we realize, man, you know what?

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I'm making pretty good progress, no different than Brooke and I on our drive.

150
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 We're like, man, you know what? This is actually pretty nice.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 I feel like I'm making good headway.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And yet what you need to know is at some point in the future,

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 maybe it's sooner, maybe it's later,

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 there's going to come a point at which you will not be enough in your own strength.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Circumstances are going to start piling up no different than the snow around us did.

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 You're going to begin to lose traction and feel the wheels of your life just spinning in place.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 You're going to begin to actually lose visibility of who you are and why you do what you do.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And where am I even going with my life anymore?

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 This is going to be the case for all of us because none of us are sufficient in our own strength.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 We require the presence of someone greater.

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 We require the presence of God in our life.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Now, as I say that, some of you are here and you're like, you know what, Kylan?

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Maybe that's true for other people, but things are pretty good for me right now.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Like, I'm pretty happy about the way things are going in my life.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Like, I've got the job, I've got the girl, the guy, I've got my 401k match,

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I've got the corner office already.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Like, I've got everything that I want.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I've got things to do and not enough time to do them.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Like, I feel good, man. I think I'm doing pretty well for myself.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And yet, here's what I would tell you.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 You might be doing good right now, but you will not do good regardless.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Something is going to come that is actually going to sideline you,

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 put you on the shoulder of whatever highway in life you're driving.

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 What you need is you need someone greater.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And yet, here's the great danger facing young adults.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Not just young adults generally that are out there in the ether,

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 but young adults here right now.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 People like you, sitting to your left and to your right.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 You can judge them if you'd like.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Every young adult is facing this great danger,

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and the danger is that we will settle for lives of passable pleasure

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 when insurmountable satisfaction is available.

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 This is the danger facing us.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 We will find ourselves just settling for quiet pleasantries

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 when there is something bold and beautiful and grand awaiting us

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 if we would only choose to follow it instead.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 You see, I'm convinced that Jesus Christ, in the life he lived,

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 leaving heaven, coming to earth, living 33 years,

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 and facing temptation in every way you might,

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 dying a death that he did not deserve to die,

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 so that way he could take your place and offer you your salvation.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And yet, not only did he die, he rose from the grave

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 and he took back his life into his own hands.

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 He beat death by death itself, and he rose victoriously.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I believe that Jesus did all of that

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 for more than a lifestyle of above-average morality,

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 fighting the nagging guilt of a missed quiet time,

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 and living off the lessons of people who care about God more than you do.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I think he wants more for you.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 The question is, do you want more for yourself?

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 If you're here, if you want more for yourself,

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 then I want to tell you how to find it.

203
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And the place that we're going to do that is in the book of Exodus.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 That's the second book in the Bible, and will be in chapter 33.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 You can go ahead and grab a Bible, and you can turn there right now.

206
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We've been in a series called Revive, if you're new to the room,

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 where we've been studying the principles of personal renewal.

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 If you think about personal renewal, another way of thinking about it is

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 rekindling the love you have for Jesus.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Rekindling, because like a fire,

211
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 often the love we have for God can grow dormant.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 It can even feel like it's faded.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And yet, when you look at a fire that's gone out,

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 anybody been camping and stoked a fire together?

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 What you realize is you might see that fire and realize,

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 there's no smoke rising, all the light is fading.

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 There's no warmth to come near to.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And yet, the possibility of fire is still present.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Why is that?

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Because there are embers glowing underneath.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And what you have to do is you have to provide two things to those embers.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 You have to provide fuel, and you have to provide care.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Fuel, that's what we've been doing here.

224
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Like every single week in this series,

225
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 I've been trying to hand you fuel for the fire of your faith.

226
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I've tried to lead us along and show you,

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 hey, this is how you break up hard-heartedness.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 This is what it looks like to cultivate hunger, hunger for God.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 This is how you walk in repentance, genuine repentance.

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 You turn away from that which you were seeking,

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 and instead you turn towards him and you pursue him again.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 This is what it looks like to commit your life in consecration.

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 The same idea that we were just talking about,

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 giving up not just bad, but even giving up good to get more of God.

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And then how do you persist in zeal?

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Tyler did an amazing job of walking us through that last week.

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And then tonight I'm going to help you understand

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 how you can become a presence-centered person.

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 I will give you the fuel.

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I will add to your life the logs.

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But I cannot care for your fire.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You have to do that. That's your job.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And yet, here's the thing.

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 If you'll care for your fire and you'll care for your fire

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 what happens is individual spot fires of renewal

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 band together into a wildfire of revival.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 That's what happens.

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And what happens when wildfires take root?

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 They spread. They spread.

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Not just in your life and not just in our room.

251
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 They make their way out of our doors and into your neighborhoods.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They find themselves amongst your family,

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 saving those that you thought could not be saved.

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 They make their way into your office spaces,

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 into your classrooms.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 They end up in your, they end up not just impacting our church

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 or your apartment complex.

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 It impacts the rest of our city and it bursts out into the nation

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 and then eventually it impacts a generation.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 This is how revival happens.

261
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And what's amazing is God is already doing this.

262
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Like I'm not just looking at you and kind of throwing ideas

263
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and hoping something sticks.

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 We can look at the data, which we have,

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 and you can go back and watch it

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 and see that God is already moving in amazing ways.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And it may be bold,

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 but poor, I think he wants to move here.

269
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 God, I really think that.

270
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I really believe the Lord wants to move here.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 He's been moving to be clear,

272
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 but I think he wants a special outpouring of his spirit in this place.

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And he doesn't just want to do it for all of us together.

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 He wants to do it for you individually.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But the way that comes is by us saying,

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 yes, God, more of you, please.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 It's by doing what Moses is going to teach us tonight,

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 becoming a presence centered person.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Now, just for some context, before we jump into the passage,

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 we're in Exodus 33.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 The chapter before in Exodus 32,

282
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 we see Israel on the heels of one of its very worst moments.

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 In Exodus 32, they decided while Moses was up on Mount Sinai,

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 he was receiving the 10 commandments from God.

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And when you hear 10 commandments,

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 you can't think about rules to follow.

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 You need to think about vows and a marriage.

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Moses comes down with those 10 commandments.

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And as he comes down, he realizes everything has gone haywire.

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 These people are not waiting for him.

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Instead, they are worshiping someone else.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 They are worshiping, not just a God they found, a golden calf.

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 They are worshiping a God they made.

294
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 One that they took off their jewelry.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 They removed their gold and they melted it into a place

296
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 where they could actually begin to worship.

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 You see, to give you a picture of what this would look like,

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 is this is the wedding day of God to his bride, Israel.

299
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And they have just cheated on the groom

300
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 with a cheap groomsman instead.

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 That's not just idolatry.

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 That's treachery.

303
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And so God looks at Moses and he says, "I'm out. I'm done.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 I've put up with them long enough.

305
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I've dealt with their grumbling and complaining through the wilderness.

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I've provided for their every need.

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Have they not seen what I've done?

308
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I split the Red Sea.

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 I brought plagues to deliver them from their persecution.

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And this is what they're doing."

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And Moses, he intercedes, talks God off the cliff,

312
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 tells him, "Hey, don't forget your commitment and covenant to these people.

313
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 We have a promised land that we're going to."

314
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And as that conversation continues, we pick it up in verse one.

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 "The Lord said to Moses, 'Depart. Go up from here.

316
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 You and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt

317
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

318
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 saying, 'To your offspring I will give it.

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I'll send an angel before you, and I'll drive out the Canaanites,

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey.

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 But I'm not going up among you,

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 because I might consume you on the way, for you're a stiff-necked people.'"

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 If we jump down to 15, we see Moses' response to God.

325
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 "He said to him, 'Lord, if your presence will not go with me,

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 then do not bring us up from here.'"

327
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So let me ask you,

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 what would possess Moses to say something like that?

329
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Like, that's crazy, isn't it?

330
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Like, I'll put it in your situation.

331
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 What if God promised to give you the good life?

332
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Like, happiness and health, job satisfaction, six figures going on seven.

333
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 He decided to move you into a situation

334
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 where you had the perfect apartment in uptown,

335
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 you had six weeks paid vacation, and you drove a brand new Rivian.

336
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 What if God was like, "I'll give you all of that,

337
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 but I will not be with you."

338
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 What would you say to that?

339
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Listen, can't we just be real?

340
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 That would be hard to say no to.

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And yet Moses, facing a similar internal crisis,

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 looks at God and says, "Listen, I would rather have the desert with you

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 than the promised land without you."

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But Moses, it's the promised land.

345
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Like, this is the thing that your forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

346
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 they were promised and they have looked forward to for generations.

347
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 This is the very land that the nation of Israel has dreamt of indwelling

348
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 during the 400 years of their enslavement to the people of Egypt.

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And yet now, God, he has delivered them out and he's leading them on.

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 You're journeying through the desert. That's been brutal.

351
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And yet you're finally at the doorway of it.

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's a land that's flowing with milk and honey.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Anybody ever wonder what's milk and honey?

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Milk, it's nourishing. Like, it's rich in resources, but it's also honey.

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 It's pleasant. It's delightful to be a part of.

356
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 This is the place, Moses, where God is going to take your people.

357
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And you're telling me you don't want that?

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 No, I don't want that.

359
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 I don't want that if you're not going with me.

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Why?

361
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 What would compel Moses to say something like that?

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Our first point, he knows that God's presence is the point.

363
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 God's presence is the point.

364
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And it's not just the point of this story.

365
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 It's the point of all history.

366
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The entirety of your Bible is pointing to the fact that God's presence is the center of it all.

367
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 It's the center of our faith.

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 We see it in Genesis 3.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 We find that God is walking in the cool of the day through the garden.

370
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And he's looking for who?

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 For those that he wants to be with.

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 He's calling out to Adam and Eve.

373
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Like, it's amazing. In that moment, like, he didn't just give them a couple of rules to live by.

374
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Hey, you can eat of any tree, but don't you touch that one.

375
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 No, he wanted a relationship with them.

376
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And yet they royally blew it.

377
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 They're kicked out of the garden.

378
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And guess what?

379
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 God goes with them.

380
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He stays with them.

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And as we make our way into Exodus, what we find is that God, he meets with a man named Moses.

382
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And he, him, God in his presence indwells a burning bush.

383
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And he calls Moses to save his people.

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And as Moses goes and he saves his people, we get to chapter 13.

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And we realize that God's presence leads these people by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Later in the book of Exodus, that same presence of God comes and dwells amongst the people.

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 They build a tabernacle at Mount Sinai.

388
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And God's presence comes and fills it.

389
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And if you look at pictures of the way it's all set up, that tabernacle existed at the center of God's people.

390
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Not by happenstance, because he is meant to be the center of their entire reality.

391
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And as they go from Mount Sinai and they journey through the wilderness,

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 we see that they get to the land of Canaan.

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And he speaks to Joshua, "I will be with you."

394
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 God is going to be with his people as they go in to conquer the land that was promised.

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 You get to 1 Chronicles 13.

396
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And what you see is that one of David's first orders of business as he comes into his kingdom

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 is he wants to take the Ark of the Covenant back from the Philistines and restore it to its rightful place

398
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 because he wants it to be the center, God's very presence, of all his people.

399
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 You get to 2 Chronicles.

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 You get introduced to David's son, King Solomon.

401
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And King Solomon builds not only a tabernacle, he builds the temple.

402
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And God's presence moves from the tabernacle and dwells the temple

403
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 because he wants to be near his people.

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Tragically, you get to the book of Ezekiel.

405
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 In Ezekiel chapter 10, you see that as Israel continued in its idolatry and its hypocrisy,

406
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 God's presence leaves.

407
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He dips out the side door.

408
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 He exits stage right.

409
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And yet, despite years of silence, you turn to Matthew 1 and you hear a child's cry,

410
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 a child whose name is Emmanuel, which means God with us.

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 The presence of God has returned to his people.

412
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 At the end of Jesus' life, Emmanuel, God with us, we see that he says,

413
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 "Hey, it's better for me to go. That way the Holy Spirit might come."

414
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Why is that good?

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Because not only will you have the presence of God in me, you will have the presence of God in you

416
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 because I will indwell you by way of my spirit.

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 And then when you get to the very end of the entire story, at the book of Revelation,

418
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 in chapter 21, you see what it's been building to.

419
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 That the dwelling place of God is with man.

420
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 He will dwell with them and they will be his people and God will also be among them.

421
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Don't you see it?

422
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 God is the point.

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 The presence of God is the point.

424
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That's what all of this is building to.

425
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 This is the central truth.

426
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 God wants to be with you.

427
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 With me?

428
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Yes, with you.

429
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 But does he know what I've done?

430
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Yes, he knows what you've done.

431
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Does he know what I want to do?

432
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 He knows that too.

433
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And yet he still says, "I want to be with you."

434
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 That's his heart.

435
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 We know this is not just generally speaking either.

436
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Yes, God is omnipresent.

437
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Meaning that he is everywhere, at all times, all at once.

438
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 There's no place that God is not.

439
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 We read this in Psalm 139, verses 7-8.

440
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 David says, "Where shall I go from your spirit?

441
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Or where shall I flee from your presence?

442
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 If I ascend to heaven, you're there.

443
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And if I make my bed in Sheol, you're there."

444
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 There's nowhere you can go that God will not be.

445
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 What a mind-blowing reality to consider.

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Like, God is infinitely present.

447
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 And yet, what we're reading in the story of Scripture

448
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 is there's more.

449
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 It's not just that God doesn't want to be

450
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 distantly present with you.

451
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 He wants to be directly present with you.

452
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 That's what we find.

453
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 He doesn't just want to be omnipresent.

454
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He wants to be manifest in presence.

455
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 The Hebrew word, as we read this idea of presence,

456
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 is the word "panim."

457
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It means "face."

458
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 So that as anyone in the Scriptures,

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 and you in your life seek the presence of God,

460
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 what you're doing is you're trying to seek God's face.

461
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 You want to know him.

462
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Well, how do you know someone's face?

463
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Well, a few things have to be true.

464
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 There needs to be proximity, right?

465
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 You can't know someone and what they look like

466
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 if they are standing across the room.

467
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You back there, young man,

468
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I have no idea what the contours of your face look like.

469
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And yet I know that if I were to come close,

470
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I could figure some things out.

471
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 People come up to me all the time,

472
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 and they're like, "Man, you look different."

473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And I respond, "Thank you?"

474
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 What they're saying is, "I've never been up close.

475
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I've always seen you at a distance or on a screen."

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And yet there has to be proximity

477
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 if you're going to know someone's face.

478
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 The same must be true if you're going to seek God's presence.

479
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But proximity isn't enough.

480
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 You also have to have consistency.

481
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Consistency.

482
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Everybody has someone that they recognize the face of

483
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 that they don't actually know.

484
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Someone that--I mean, you always see them at the gym,

485
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 and you just recognize them because, man,

486
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 we're always in the same place.

487
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 There is a level of frequency in our encounters.

488
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Or maybe they frequent the same kind of coffee shop that you go to.

489
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Maybe it's not that.

490
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Maybe they're sitting in the same section as you here tonight,

491
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and that's why you choose to sit in that section every single Tuesday,

492
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 because you know they'll be here,

493
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 and you just love gazing upon their face.

494
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 There is a consistency--to the degree you laugh,

495
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 because it might be true--

496
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 there's a consistency and a frequency

497
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 involved in knowing someone's face.

498
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 But then there's something else that's important.

499
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 There has to be intimacy.

500
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Like, it's not enough to be close,

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and it's not enough to be constant.

502
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 There also has to be a--

503
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 there has to be an element of time spent with one another.

504
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Like, you can't rush time with someone.

505
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Like, if you spend a long time with someone,

506
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 you can study who they are.

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 You can learn the different facets of their being.

508
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 I've always thought it's strange when people

509
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 love to look upon their beloved while they sleep.

510
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Why do they do that?

511
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Because they're studying their countenance.

512
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You know, like, they're engaging in an intimate moment

513
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 where they can learn exactly what they look like.

514
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 In a similar way, if you want to know God,

515
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 seek His presence,

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 then you need to be intimate with Him.

517
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 You see, you can't carve just 15 minutes every morning

518
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 out of your day to study the Scriptures

519
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 or pray to God and assume that that will be enough.

520
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 There's no one in your life that you know well

521
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 that you simply spend 15 minutes a day with.

522
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 No, you spend considerable time with them,

523
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 and no different, you should spend considerable time with God.

524
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Moses knew God.

525
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 In verse 11 of this exact same chapter, it says,

526
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 "Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face

527
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 as a man speaks to his friend."

528
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 They were familiar with one another.

529
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Like, that's what that's getting at.

530
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 They were familiar with one another.

531
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 They weren't strangers.

532
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 They were friends.

533
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So let me ask you here, what are you familiar with?

534
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 What is it that you have familiarized yourself with?

535
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Is it YouTube videos about how to fix your banana slice off the T-box?

536
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Is it following whatever social media influencer you like

537
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 and you like to know what they like to know, right?

538
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Like to know whatever that thing is?

539
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Is it the latest input or opinions of your favorite podcast personalities?

540
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Rogan, Hoverman, Shapiro, Peterson.

541
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And you want to know what they have to say

542
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 about whatever current event is actually happening?

543
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Is it an emerging market?

544
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So that way you can be the first to invest.

545
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 What is it that you are most familiar with?

546
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Is it people in your life that you love to track with what they're doing

547
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 and who they're dating and where they're going

548
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 and where their latest travel escapades were?

549
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 What are you familiar with?

550
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Listen, if God feels more like a stranger and less than a friend like these,

551
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 then I just want to love you enough to tell you you're missing the point.

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You are missing the point.

553
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 The point of creation is God's presence.

554
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And it's the point of not only this story but your story too.

555
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 God wants to be near to you.

556
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 You should long to be near to him as well.

557
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And what we find is as we seek his presence,

558
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 we find more of it.

559
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And the differences are significant.

560
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 That's where Moses goes next.

561
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He says in verse 16,

562
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 "For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight,

563
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I in your people?

564
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Is it not in your going with us that we are distinct,

565
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 I in your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"

566
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 So let me just talk to the believers in this room for a moment.

567
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 The porch is always a place for any person regardless of spiritual background.

568
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And yet there are moments in the Bible where really the text is speaking

569
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 very specifically to God's people.

570
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And this is one of those moments.

571
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 So let me just speak to the Christian.

572
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I have been a Christian for a very long time.

573
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 When I studied this specific passage years ago,

574
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 what I found was something like a bombshell.

575
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Like it shifted my paradigm completely.

576
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Because what I realized in this moment is Moses is saying,

577
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "Hey, what is going to distinguish you, set you apart,

578
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 is not what you know, it's not what you believe,

579
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and it's not what you do."

580
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Well, what is it, Moses?

581
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 God's presence distinguishes us from the world.

582
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 That's your second point.

583
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 God's presence distinguishes us from the world.

584
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 It's not that we're Calvinist or Arminian.

585
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 It's not that we believe the sign gifts are present or they're dormant.

586
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 It's not that, well, I'm a part of this denomination

587
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 or I'm a part of no denomination.

588
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 It's not I read the ESV or you read the NASV, which version is correct.

589
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 It's not that you're pro-Trump or anti-Trump.

590
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Like all of the ways that we love to self-identify when it comes to our faith

591
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 are none of the ways that Moses is self-identifying here.

592
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 You see, when you study the scriptures,

593
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 all of our heroes of the faith are not known

594
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 for the theological tribes that they belonged to.

595
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 What they're known for is that they were with God.

596
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Like Enoch walked with God. Noah walked with God.

597
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Abraham was a friend of God.

598
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Jacob wrestled with God. Moses spoke to God face to face.

599
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 We just read that. Hannah prayed and trusted in God.

600
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 David was a man after God's own heart.

601
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Elijah met with God. Mary and Martha, they were friends of Jesus.

602
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And then what you see in the book of Acts is Peter and John,

603
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 they had clearly been with Jesus as attested by the very men

604
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 who put Christ to death.

605
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 In this world, you Christian are not known by your doctrinal distinctive,

606
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 your worship preferences, or what Christian influencer

607
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 you happen to know personally.

608
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 What you're meant to be known by is God's presence.

609
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 People should look at you and they should say, "You've been with God."

610
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 That should be the reality for you.

611
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And yet this isn't the case for so many of us.

612
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 So many of us, we major in the minors and we minor in the majors.

613
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 What matters most is that we abide in Jesus and we bear the fruit of that abiding.

614
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 That we produce the fruit of the Spirit.

615
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 That we look more like Him.

616
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 That we actually exemplify His character to a world that is in desperate need of it.

617
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And what's amazing is that as we do this, what we see is that

618
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 when God's presence becomes the distinguishing force for us personally,

619
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 it becomes the distinguishing force for us communally.

620
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 That's what Paul writes to the Corinthians.

621
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 He says this in 1 Corinthians 3, 16.

622
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 He says, "Do you," and the "you" there is plural.

623
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 It's "y'all."

624
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 "Do y'all not know that y'all are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in y'all?"

625
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You see, what he's saying is that when you're individually distinguished by God's presence

626
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 and we come together, we are communally distinguished by God's presence.

627
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And that's compelling to the world.

628
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 The world looks at it and says, "Man, God must be among you,"

629
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 which is what Paul says later in the book of 1 Corinthians.

630
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 I like the way that Charles Finney puts it.

631
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 He's a revivalist from the second great awakening.

632
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 He says this. He says, "If the presence of God is in the church,

633
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 the church will draw the world in.

634
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 But if the presence of God is not in the church,

635
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 the world will draw the church out."

636
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 That's a big distinction.

637
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Listen, either the church will impact the world

638
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 or the world will impact the church.

639
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And I'll just level with you.

640
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 People in the world don't want a church that looks like the world.

641
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 People in the world, they want a church that looks like the church

642
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 and they want Christians that look like Christ.

643
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 We're seeing this right now. It's fascinating.

644
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 If you study the Quiet Revival in the UK,

645
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 there are two specific denominational groups

646
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 that are rising in their church attendance.

647
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 You know what they are?

648
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 It's the Catholic church and it's the Pentecostal church,

649
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 which is fascinating because they could not have less in common with one another.

650
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 You see, they are wildly different in their spiritual expression,

651
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 and yet they share very strongly an emphasis of their spirituality.

652
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 The world looks at them and says, "You don't look like us.

653
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 You look like Jesus. You look religious.

654
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 You look spiritual. You look different."

655
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Porch, to the Christian very specifically,

656
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 it is time for the church to become spiritual again.

657
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 It's time for the church to become spiritual again.

658
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 We don't just gather for service.

659
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 No, we're drawing near to God when we come into spaces like this.

660
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 We're not just reading the Bible.

661
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 We're listening to God speak.

662
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 We're not just praying some prayers to an empty ceiling.

663
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 No, we actually believe that we have a God who hears.

664
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 We're not just confessing our sin.

665
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 No, we're seeking God's forgiveness because we know that forgiveness can be found.

666
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 We're not just hanging out with our friends.

667
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 No, this is the body of Christ.

668
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 When we gather, He's present amongst us.

669
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Do you see it?

670
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 There's something deeply spiritual happening as God's people come together in community.

671
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Now, here's the thing.

672
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 As I share all of that and I talk about, "Man, we've got to up our spirituality,"

673
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 it sends people in a variety of different directions.

674
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Some of you, you're worried that things are going to get kind of weird in here.

675
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Others of you are already weird in here, and you're like, "Good.

676
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 It's time for people to catch up."

677
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Let me just speak to both camps, okay?

678
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 For those of you that are more intellectually acquainted with God,

679
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 the goal is to become more intimately acquainted with God.

680
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 That's the step for you.

681
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 That's going to require some feelings.

682
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 You cannot be intimate with someone if you do not have feelings for someone.

683
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 There's a big difference in knowing about someone and knowing someone personally.

684
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Let me just put it to you like this.

685
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Would you believe that I love my wife if all I could do is report to you the facts of our marriage?

686
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 If I could tell you when we met, what the weather was like on our wedding day,

687
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 where it is that we went on our honeymoon,

688
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 would you feel convinced that I actually love my wife?

689
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 No, because it's not in reporting the facts,

690
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 but reliving the feelings that you're convinced I love her,

691
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 that I can look at you and I can say, "Man, I'm genuinely embarrassed

692
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 about how long it took for me to make a move and tell her that I liked her."

693
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 I remember whenever we went on our very first date,

694
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I, like a small-town kid, did not realize you needed to make reservations

695
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 at a restaurant in the big city of Dallas.

696
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 On our wedding day, she and I both feel some regret over the reality that, man,

697
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 the weather was colder than we thought it was going to be for an outdoor wedding.

698
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 When we went on our honeymoon, I unashamedly wanted to go to an all-inclusive

699
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 because I wanted to feel guilt-free of ordering a BLT in the middle of the night.

700
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 You know, this was what was true for us.

701
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 You know that I love my wife because I have feelings to back it up.

702
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Listen, emotions add veracity to your faith.

703
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Emotions add veracity to your faith.

704
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 And so what that means for some of you in this room

705
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 is you need to respond with some emotion.

706
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Everybody lift your hands.

707
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Everybody lift your hands.

708
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 You've just proven to yourself you, in fact, can do this.

709
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Some of you were unsure.

710
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Some of you have questioned if I can actually raise my hands in moments of worship.

711
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 You can do it. We can all do it.

712
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 And as you do it, what happens is you become convinced of the very thing that you claim to believe.

713
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Listen, I am committed--you may hate me for this--

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 but every week, having our care team sit down to my right and to my left,

715
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 and they're here so that way you have to walk across the room to engage with them if you want prayer.

716
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I am committed to making that as awkward and uncomfortable for you as possible.

717
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Why?

718
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 So that way when you turn around and you leave,

719
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 you will be convinced that you took considerable action,

720
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 and your faith is, in fact, real.

721
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 That's why we do that.

722
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 You need to add emotion to your faith.

723
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 To those of you that are weird, that are emotionally oriented--I'm just kidding.

724
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 The goal is not to stay emotionally oriented, but to become experientially oriented.

725
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 You see, when we gather, we're not seeking a feeling.

726
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 We're seeking His face.

727
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 That's what Psalm 27:8 says.

728
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 Psalm 27 says, "You have said, 'Seek my face in my heart.'

729
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 The seat of my affections says, 'Your face, Lord, do I seek.'"

730
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 You see, everything we do here is relationally focused

731
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 because we're seeking a person when we gather in this room.

732
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 We're meeting with Jesus.

733
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 So it shouldn't be the base that stirs our soul.

734
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 It should be the words that we sing that stir us instead.

735
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 It shouldn't just be some clever story or line I give you that leads to conviction.

736
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 It should be a work of the Spirit that produces conviction.

737
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 You see, it's not the trappings of ministry that should evoke your feelings.

738
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 It's the person of Jesus, the center of Christianity, that should do it instead.

739
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 We don't just want to feel something.

740
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 In this room, we want to feel someone.

741
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 We want to experience God.

742
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 We want to be a people who rightly and really worship God.

743
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Jesus describes it like this in John 4.

744
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 He says this to the woman at the well.

745
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 He says, "But the hour is coming, and now it's here

746
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.

747
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 For the Father is seeking such a people to worship Him."

748
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Do you catch that?

749
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 God is seeking a people that will worship Him in spirit and in truth.

750
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 For God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth.

751
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 So let me ask, which way do you lean?

752
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Do you lean towards truth?

753
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 That's good. That's a great thing.

754
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 But you should be two at the same time.

755
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Do you lean towards spirit?

756
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Then you need to add truth to that as well.

757
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 God is seeking a people that do both.

758
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 He wants a people that both have a faith of fact and a faith of feeling.

759
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 That's what a full-hearted faith looks like.

760
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 That leads us to be genuine worshippers.

761
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 God is seeking a people like this.

762
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 What happens whenever we lean into it and we believe it's true

763
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 is we actually start seeking after Him, which is what Moses does next.

764
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 This is our final point.

765
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 He says in 17 and 18, "And the Lord said to Moses,

766
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 'This very thing that you have spoken, I will do,

767
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.'"

768
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 God just conceded.

769
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 He's like, "Yes, okay. I'll go with you.

770
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 We'll go to the promised land.

771
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 I won't just go with you. I will go with them."

772
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 And then Moses says, "Please show me your glory."

773
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 I think that this is simultaneously the most confusing yet convicting part

774
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 of this story and perhaps one of the most convicting parts

775
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 of the entire Bible.

776
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Like Moses just got what he needed.

777
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 God just said, "I'll come."

778
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And yet he doesn't stop there.

779
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Moses goes further.

780
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 You see, Moses, he not only needs God in the future,

781
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 he wants God in the present.

782
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 And the reason for that is because he knows God's presence

783
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 is worthy of wanting.

784
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 God's presence is worthy of wanting.

785
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Moses makes a major distinction in this moment,

786
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 that while God is dependable, he's dependable.

787
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 He can drive out our enemies.

788
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 He can bless our people.

789
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 He can distinguish us from the nations.

790
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 He's also desirable.

791
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 And here's the thing.

792
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 As I say that, I know that some of you are just shaking your head.

793
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 You're like, "Yes, I agree. I know this."

794
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 And yet you don't know it as well as you think.

795
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 You see, there's a big difference in saying, "God, I need you,"

796
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 and "God, I want you."

797
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Both are good and both are necessary, but both are different.

798
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 One is about sustenance and the other is about satisfaction.

799
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 So I'll put it to you this way.

800
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Sustenance is about getting what we need.

801
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 If you've ever been backpacking, then what you know is

802
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 the food you eat on the trail is anything less than a five-course meal.

803
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Your meals consist of things like mac and dac, you know,

804
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 sausage and beans, rice and tuna.

805
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 This is the food you eat. Why?

806
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Because the goal isn't satisfaction. The goal is sustenance.

807
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 You know what your body needs.

808
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 It needs nourishment, and so you're willing to eat

809
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 protein and carbs to keep you going down the trail ahead.

810
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 And yet, sustenance ends the minute you come off the mountain.

811
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 The minute you return to the big city,

812
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 your eyes are not looking for that which will nourish my needs.

813
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Instead, you start looking for that which will satisfy my stomach.

814
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 You start moving towards that which you want.

815
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 When my friends and I would go backpacking,

816
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 we would, in the final few days, dream about what we would eat.

817
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Double cheeseburgers, pizza, meat lovers only,

818
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 steak and potatoes, because that's actually the only right answer.

819
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 We would start fantasizing about the food we would find,

820
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 because long gone were the days of seeking sustenance.

821
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 Now was the day of seeking satisfaction.

822
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 There's a big difference in pursuing what you need and pursuing what you want.

823
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 You see, so many young adults that I visit with,

824
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 and I need you to hear me on this,

825
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 you have heard repeatedly from this stage and stages like it,

826
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 so you know it very well, that Jesus is the source of all satisfaction.

827
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Why then does your relationship only exist around sustenance?

828
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 You see, often we come to Jesus on the basis of what we need.

829
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 "Jesus, I need your help because I've got this conversation coming up at work,

830
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 and my boss is crazy," or "Jesus, I need you to give me some support

831
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 because a conflict with my mom, it never goes well,"

832
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 or "Jesus, I need you because my chronic pain, it's crippling."

833
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 And listen, Jesus, he delights to be needed.

834
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 That is part of the Christian experience.

835
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Do not be mistaken.

836
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 We need Jesus to save us from our sin, to forgive us of our trespasses,

837
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 to heal us of our hearts, to be the Lord of our life.

838
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 We need Jesus, but he is also worthy of wanting.

839
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 You see, so very often we need Jesus, but we don't want him.

840
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 And the reason for that is because when we're out of options,

841
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 he's always the one we turn to.

842
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 But when we have other options, he's seldom, if ever, the one we turn to.

843
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 You see, you'll have a free Saturday morning,

844
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 and so you'll hit the gym, you'll go to spin, you'll take a brunch,

845
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 you'll do whatever it is that you want,

846
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 when in reality, I mean, you actually,

847
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 you could take some of that time to read the word.

848
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 You'll have some downtime at the office,

849
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 and so you'll spend it shopping for a new top for the summer,

850
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 for a dress for that wedding, new shoes to add to your collection,

851
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 and you'll try to bury it in a million different tabs

852
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 so your boss will never know.

853
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 And yet, what if you took the time

854
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 and you journaled five things you're grateful for to Jesus instead?

855
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 You'll have an evening free, for once.

856
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And you could take the evening and you could seek him, pray to him.

857
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 But Love Island just came out two weeks ago,

858
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 and I'm already one episode behind.

859
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Listen, we laugh at this stuff, but we do this stuff.

860
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 I do this stuff.

861
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 We are all a part of this moment together.

862
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Let me be very clear.

863
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 Jesus is not trying to guilt trip you.

864
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 He's not against your pastimes or your hobbies.

865
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 He might be against Love Island,

866
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 but what we do know is that Jesus,

867
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 he wants to satisfy you,

868
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 and yet, if we only ever interact with him out of need,

869
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 we should never be expected to be satisfied.

870
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 You cannot come to him in moments where you are needing sustenance

871
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 and you expect him to give you satisfaction.

872
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 You have to come to him when the options are open

873
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 and you choose him instead because you want him most.

874
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 A.W. Tozer, one of my favorite quotes says,

875
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 "Complacency is a deadly foe of all spiritual growth.

876
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Acute desire, desire, must be present

877
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 or there will be no manifestation of Christ to his people.

878
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 He waits to be wanted too bad,

879
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 too bad that with many of us,

880
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 he waits so long, so very long in vain."

881
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 God waits to be wanted, not just needed.

882
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 So friends, we shouldn't want for more of God.

883
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 Friends, we should want for more of God

884
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 and not just need more from God.

885
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Moses wanted more of God,

886
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 and so God gave Moses more of himself.

887
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 This is where we'll end.

888
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 In 19 and 20, he said,

889
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 "I will make my goodness pass before you

890
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 and will proclaim before you the name of the Lord,

891
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,

892
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 and I'll show mercy on whom I will show mercy,

893
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 but," he said, "you can't see my face,

894
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 for man shall not see me and live."

895
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Friends, listen, do you want more of God?

896
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 Then you can have him.

897
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 You can have more of God,

898
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 and you can have more of God in a way

899
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 that Moses himself could not have.

900
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 For Moses could not look upon the face of God,

901
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 but we have looked upon the face of God

902
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 and that we have seen Jesus Christ himself.

903
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Moses, he knew that he could not see God and live,

904
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 and yet those who live have seen God

905
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 and that they have seen Jesus himself.

906
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 Moses, he asked to see God's glory,

907
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 but we have seen God's glory

908
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 in that Jesus is the radiance of the glory of God

909
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 and the exact imprint of his nature.

910
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 You see, we know that.

911
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 Jesus always understood God's presence is the point.

912
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 God has always longed to be near us,

913
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 and in order to make that happen,

914
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
 Jesus came close to us.

915
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 He left heaven, he came to earth,

916
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 not just to save someone's general sins,

917
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 but to save you from yours.

918
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 We know that Jesus understood it's my presence

919
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 which will distinguish them,

920
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 and so I will live and die and rise

921
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 that they might have my presence within them,

922
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 my Holy Spirit that will distinguish them

923
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 from the rest of the world.

924
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 We can also be convinced that Jesus knew,

925
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 man, my presence is worthy of wanting,

926
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 but they don't want it.

927
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 They don't want it because they do not realize

928
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
 that their wanting is warranted,

929
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 and so I, I will want them first.

930
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
 I will come closest to them,

931
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
 and by way of me doing so, they will want me,

932
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 not just today, not just tomorrow, but forever.

933
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 Do you want Jesus here tonight?

934
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 We're gonna move into a time

935
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 where we're singing in worship

936
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 as a declaration of our desire that God, we want you.

937
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 If you don't want him, then what you need to know

938
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 is we've got some people down front

939
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 that would love to pray with you,

940
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
 and the walk is awkward, and it's very uncomfortable,

941
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
 and yet they would love to process with you

942
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
 why you may be lacking in desire,

943
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 but we wanna take time over the rest of the evening,

944
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
 and we just wanna sing, and we wanna respond,

945
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
 and we wanna rejoice because we believe

946
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 not just in head, but in heart

947
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
 that he is worthy of wanting,

948
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
 and we want to convince him that that's true.

949
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 Let me pray that we would.

950
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
 Father, we love you.

951
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 We said it at the beginning.

952
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 We believe that now.

953
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 I'm grateful that your word is so very sufficient,

954
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 that Jesus, you have met us in our need,

955
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 and now, God, we pray you would cultivate our desire,

956
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 that you would hear from us hearts of worship,

957
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 worship of wanting, desire to be near.

958
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 Would the cry of this room be yearning, longing

959
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 to have more of you?

960
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 We sing to you now.

961
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 It's in Jesus' name, amen.

962
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
 You can stand where you are,

963
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 and you can respond as you feel led.
