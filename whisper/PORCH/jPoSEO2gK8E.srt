00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Well, what's up, Porch? How are we doing tonight?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Cheers]

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey, it's good to see you. Great to be with you.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hope all is well. Thanks for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 If this is your first time ever with us, thank you for trusting us.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And I hope that this place feels comfortable and like home for you.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I do want to give a shout-out to all of our Porch Live locations watching tonight.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Like you, Porch Live Boise, and Porch Live Dayton, Porch Live Scottsdale.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Thank you for tuning in. I hope that all is well with you guys.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Some of you have heard me share this before, but several years ago,

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 some of my closest friends, Sterling and Natalie, they bought this older home.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And this older home had this one room at the back of the house.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And that one room had its own air conditioning unit.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 You're like, "Why are we talking about HVAC?" Well, let me tell you.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 The previous owners had bought an air conditioning system for this one room

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 that was just too big for the room. And I don't know all the ins and outs of HVAC,

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 but what my friend told me was happening was that this system was short-cycling,

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 which means that it was overproducing.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So without my friends Sterling and Natalie knowing it,

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 there was moisture that was forming on the inside of the unit without them knowing,

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 and it was causing mold to build up in the unit.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 The problem is that my friend Natalie has a condition where her body

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 struggles to eliminate toxins. She's had this struggle for about two decades.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And so I want you to think about what was happening.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Without them knowing it, this air conditioning unit was quietly operating

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 in the background of their lives every single day,

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 and it was blowing air through their home,

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 which was actually poisoning Natalie's body and sabotaging her health.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 The reason I tell you that is because tonight we're going to talk about our past failures.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 We're talking about that moment or that season in your past

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 that you could just slap the label on, "What was I thinking?"

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 For some of you, it was like college. It was like, "Well, what part of college?"

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 College. "What was I thinking?" Not going to it, but what you did in college.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Some of you all were like it was freshman year of college,

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 or for others it was like it was the relationship with that girl

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 or that guy or that choice I made in my first job or that abortion.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 It was that choice in my past that when you look back on it,

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 it just causes shame, regret.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 And without us realizing it, our past failures can be a lot like

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 my friend's air conditioning unit.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Our past failures can quietly operate in the background of our lives,

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 blowing shame and regret through our souls like air through a house.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And that shame and regret can poison our souls, and it can lead to all sorts of issues.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 It'll impact your relationship with God. It'll impact your relationship with others.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It'll impact your future marriage and the way that you parent your kids.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Like, our shame and regret has to be dealt with.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And so I don't know what you think of when I ask you, "What is it?

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 What is it from your past?"

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So when you look back on it, you just think, "What was I thinking?"

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Like, if you could have a do-over, if you just could hit a button

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 that would cause things to loop back and you could just try it again

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 or do it differently, what would it be for you?

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I just want you to know that this talk is deeply personal for me,

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 and I've shared my story here at the porch a lot, but if you're new here,

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 the reality is during my young adult years, I was here in Dallas.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I was going to Dallas Seminary like I was getting a degree in Jesus.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And at the same time, I was working at a church with high school students,

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 and I was telling high school students one way to live.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And then at the same time, in my private life, I was doing the opposite,

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 and I was living a compromising life.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I was making compromising decisions, and those compromising decisions

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 led to major consequences in my life.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 It all boiled up to a point where I had to sit with about 50 or 60 staff members

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 at the church I was working at and share with them my sin.

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And I had to step out of all forms of leadership in ministry.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And when that happened, man, shame and regret moved in

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 and made themselves at home, and my failures began to quietly operate

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 in the background of my life, and my past failure began to blow shame

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 and regret through the soul, through the house of my soul,

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 like air through my friend's house.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And it impacted me in so many ways, so many ways.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Like I remember going to that church, and whenever I would go to that church,

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 it was like everyone--I just thought everyone was looking at me

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 like I began to believe everyone saw me for my sin,

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 or if I saw someone out in public from that church, I just began to think,

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 "Well, they probably, when they see me, they just think about what I've done."

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Or when I started dating my wife, Catherine, she just had a cleaner past than me.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And so I felt unworthy of God's good gift of Catherine in my life.

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 I just didn't believe that I deserved her.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Like I deserved something less because of my past.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Or when I got back into ministry and I became a student pastor,

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 I felt so ashamed to be in ministry with the past that I had

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 because I thought that I was unqualified.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Let me change that wording because we're all in some ways unqualified for ministry.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I felt unfit. I felt unusable by God.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And then I also operated with this mentality that I just wanted to get

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 as far away from my failure as quickly as possible

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 because the more distance I could put between my failure and my present,

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 the more God would like me.

91
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Can you resonate with any of this?

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Like, do you know what I'm talking about when I talk about shame?

93
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 What I'm really talking about is, you know what shame does?

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Shame attacks your identity.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Like something happens where you move from "I failed" to "I'm a failure."

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And so you might not lead with that.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 If you're out at lunch and someone's like, "Hey, tell me about yourself.

98
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Let me start out. I'm a failure. I like college football. How about you?"

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Like, maybe you don't lead with it.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Maybe that's not even what you think on a regular basis.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But if you were to just kind of zoom out and look at your behavior,

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 you operate as a failure.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Like, it's in your wiring. It's your mentality.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's the difference between your identity and activity.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I did fail. That's my activity. I did fail.

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And yet my activity became my identity.

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And what I had done became who I was.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I was a failure.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And so I just wonder how many people here, like if you were honest,

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 if you were to somehow just in the quietness of your own heart,

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 or when you're laying in bed at night and you finally turn the phone off

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 and all you are left with is your thoughts,

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I wonder how many people just live under the crushing weight

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 of the banner over your life that you have put there.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And that banner reads "failure."

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 You know what's interesting is I talked to Sterling and Natalie

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 about that messed up air conditioning unit.

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 You know what they told me?

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 They said, "You know, before we understood what was going on,

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 we tried a bunch of different things to help Natalie with her health."

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And so she would try different things,

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 and certain things would work for a short period of time.

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 So she might have a good day here or a good day here,

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 but ultimately her health would tank.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And it's because they weren't treating the problem.

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 So ultimately what they had to do was they had to identify the source of the problem,

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and someone had to come in and rip out that busted system

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 and put in something new.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I tell you that just to say, you know what,

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 we have all sorts of ways of dealing with our shame.

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 All sorts of ways.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Like if you know what it feels like to fail,

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 you're like, "Man, if I could just have a do-over."

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 If you can look back and you can pinpoint something,

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I wonder what you've done to kind of manage that shame.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Some of us, we make promises to God.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 "God, I'm never going to look at porn again.

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Mark the calendar, mark the day, this is it, never looking at porn again.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 God, if you will just give me another girlfriend or another boyfriend,

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I promise you I will never do anything bad again.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I will never do anything impure again.

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I promise I am never going to do this again or that again."

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We just make promises

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 because we think that if we can perform for God,

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He will provide for us.

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 That's actually karma, do good, get good.

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Or we don't make promises, we just compare.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Like we go out and we look for someone who has failed worse than we have,

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and they just make us feel better about ourselves.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 It's like, "I know I failed, but I didn't fail like that.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Like at least it wasn't that bad."

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Or you know what we do is we punish ourselves.

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Like we deprive ourselves of good gifts from God

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 because we think that if we can kind of pay for our failures,

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 like we can balance the scales in our own lives.

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 The reality is just like Sterling and Natalie needed someone to step in

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 and intervene and rip out the broken and busted air conditioning of their house,

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Jesus Christ wants to step into our lives tonight

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 and rip out the busted failure

160
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 that is blowing shame and regret through the house of your soul,

161
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 poisoning your life and distorting your identity.

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Jesus is going to show us what he wants to do with our past failure

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 by allowing us to see what he did with Peter's past failure.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And so if you have a Bible, I want you to turn with me tonight

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 all the way to the end of the book of John.

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 John chapter 21.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 If you've been with us over the last several weeks,

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 we've been in this series called Glory.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 The glory of God is the supreme goodness of God.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 It is everything praiseworthy and good about God.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And God's glory, his goodness, has been demonstrated and displayed to us

172
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 in the person of Jesus Christ.

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And so every week that we've been in the book of John,

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 we've just been looking at one activity of Jesus that displays the glory of God.

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And today we're going to see Jesus as Restorer.

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Jesus Christ is the Restorer of our souls.

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 If you're new to the Bible and you're not very familiar with Peter,

178
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Peter was one of Jesus' 12 closest friends, but it was even more than that.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Like Jesus had three that he spent even more time with.

180
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Peter was one of those.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Like he was super tight with Jesus.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Jesus gave Peter a new name.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Peter's original name was Simon, and Jesus gave him the name Peter.

184
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 Like when you give someone a nickname, that means you're tight with them.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That was Peter.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But if you're familiar with the Bible, then you know what Peter's greatest failure was.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 What was it?

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Yeah, he denied Jesus three times.

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 On the night that Jesus was betrayed and arrested.

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 So listen to the wording before we get to John 21.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Listen to the wording of Luke 22, which tells us what happens right after Peter denies Jesus for the third time.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 It says this in Luke 22, verse 61.

193
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It says, "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter remembered the saying of the Lord,

194
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 how he had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.'

195
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And he went out and wept bitterly."

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Like this is in the Bible.

197
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Like I don't know what you think is in the Bible.

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 If you've never taken time to read it, this is not just some like mythical world of larger than life people who never struggle.

199
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It's the opposite.

200
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 It is real down to earth people who have real problems.

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And one of Jesus' closest friends denied him three times after he said he wouldn't.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And so what was the result?

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 He actually locks eyes with Jesus.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And in that moment, he sees a sin for what it is, and he goes out and he weeps bitterly.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Now think about it.

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 If you're God, and one of your closest friends just betrays you, you've got options.

207
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Right?

208
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Like you're in charge of that guy's story.

209
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 That guy's story could be like, "And Peter was never heard from again."

210
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Or like, "The ground split open and swallowed Peter whole, and he was never heard from again."

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Like, there's options.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And yet we turn to John chapter 21, and it says this, verse 1.

213
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 It says, "After this."

214
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 After what?

215
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 After Jesus went to the cross.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 After Jesus bore our sin and shame.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 After Jesus on the third day walked out of the tomb victoriously, conquering Satan, sin, and death.

218
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 After that.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 After this, Jesus revealed himself.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 What's the next word?

221
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 This isn't a trick.

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Like, what's the next word?

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Again.

224
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 You're like, "You want to highlight that word?"

225
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Yes.

226
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He reveals himself again to the disciples, which included Peter, by the Sea of Tiberias.

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And he revealed himself in this way.

228
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Here's why I highlight again.

229
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Like, Jesus could have done anything he wanted with Peter.

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And yet he reveals himself to Peter, not just once, not just twice, but in John 21, this is him revealing himself again.

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Because it's the third time that he has shown up in Peter's life.

232
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 You know what's interesting is when we think about Jesus being betrayed and arrested, we only think about Judas and Peter.

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Judas is the guy who betrayed Jesus, and Peter is the guy who denied Jesus.

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 But have you ever read the verse, Matthew 26, 56, which says this about the rest of the disciples?

235
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 It says, "Then all the disciples left him and fled."

236
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Have you ever thought about that?

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It wasn't just Judas.

238
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It wasn't just Peter.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 All of them, all 12, deserted Jesus Christ in his hardest hour.

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 So again, if you're God, and all 12 of your closest friends desert you, what are you going to do?

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I'd probably just get a new crew, because I could.

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I'm God.

243
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I'd be like, "These guys are jokers.

244
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 They're dead to me, and they're just dead, period.

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And I'm going a new way."

246
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And yet Jesus' actions communicate that the relationship with Peter and everyone else was still on schedule.

247
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It was on his schedule.

248
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 The disciples' compromise didn't change Jesus' commitment.

249
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So the first truth that I need you to know when dealing with your past failure is this.

250
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Your compromise doesn't change Jesus' commitment.

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Your compromise, whatever it was, it doesn't change Jesus' commitment.

252
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Some of you all need to hear this tonight.

253
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Don't miss it.

254
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 His commitment can withstand our greatest compromise.

255
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Your relationship with Jesus has never and will never rest on the strength of your character.

256
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 It has always and will always rest on the strength of his.

257
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And so I'm just going to ask everyone to look at me.

258
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I promise this isn't elementary school where it's like I need all of your eyes on me.

259
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But I'm asking for your eyes, because I don't want you to miss this.

260
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Some of you need to hear this tonight.

261
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Jesus Christ isn't even close to giving up on you.

262
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Not even close.

263
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Jesus Christ isn't even close to giving up on you.

264
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And you're like, "Well, yeah, but you don't know what I've done."

265
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 I don't need to know what you've done.

266
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 One of Jesus' best friends denied him three times.

267
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It's probably not worse than that.

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 He's not even close.

269
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 He's not even close to giving up on me.

270
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 That was one of the most beautiful realities for me to come to grips with,

271
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 to be on a walk with the Lord one night, to just be walking around the neighborhood

272
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 and to come to this realization that after all of my sin, after all of my life,

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Jesus has never once considered giving up on me.

274
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Never once.

275
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And you're like, "Well, you're a pastor." Of course not.

276
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Well, let me just go through my list of sin.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 After all of my self-sufficiency, after all the times I've prioritized other things above Jesus,

278
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 after all the careless and hurtful words towards others,

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 after the bitterness and the gluttony and the lust and the pride

280
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 and the manipulation and the selfishness and the attempts to use God for my glory,

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 not once has he ever considered giving up on me,

282
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 and not once has he withheld his love from me, and not once has he given up

283
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 or withheld his love from you.

284
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 So, just where we have to start, that your compromise does not change his commitment.

285
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Second truth that we have to deal with when we're talking about our past failures is this.

286
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Jesus is the author of new starts.

287
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 He's the author of it.

288
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 So I don't know what you brought into this place tonight, but I've got great news for you.

289
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 A new start is possible with Jesus Christ.

290
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Why? Because he's in the business of giving clean starts to messy lives.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He is the author of new starts.

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I want you to see what happens.

293
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Follow along in John 21.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 We're going to cover a lot of ground.

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 There's no way that we have time to unpack everything that's going on.

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I'm just going to hit the highlights.

297
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 But I want you to see what happens.

298
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Verse 1, it says, "After this, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias,

299
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 and he revealed himself in this way.

300
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Simon Peter, Thomas, called the twin, Nathaniel of Cana and Galilee, the sons of Zebedee,

301
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 and two others of his disciples were together.

302
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Simon Peter said to them, 'I'm going fishing.'

303
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They said to him, 'We will go with you.'

304
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore, yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

306
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Jesus said to them, 'Children, do you have any fish?'

307
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And they answered him, 'No.'

308
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 He said to them, 'Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.'

309
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the quantity of fish."

310
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Okay.

311
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Don't miss what's happening here.

312
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 If you're familiar with the Bible, this story should sound familiar to you.

313
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But here's what you need to understand.

314
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 This story happens twice in the Bible.

315
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It happens when Jesus first calls Peter to be his disciple, and then it happens right here.

316
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 So what I'm trying to show you is that Jesus kind of hits the reset button on Peter's life.

317
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 When did Jesus first call Peter to be his disciple?

318
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 It was three years prior to this.

319
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Where was Jesus when he first called Peter to be his disciple?

320
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 He was by the Sea of Galilee.

321
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Where are they now?

322
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 They're back at the Sea of Galilee.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Sea of Tiberias, that's just another name for the Sea of Galilee.

324
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 What had Peter been doing the night before Jesus showed up and called him to be his disciple?

325
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Do you know what Peter did?

326
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 He stayed up all night fishing and didn't catch anything.

327
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Jesus shows up three years prior to this story, and Jesus says, "Hey, put your nets on the other side of the boat."

328
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They do, and they catch so many fish that it begins to tear their nets.

329
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So do you see what Jesus is doing here?

330
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 He's kind of starting over with Peter.

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 He's like, "All right, let's just go back to it. They're at the Sea of Galilee. Great. Check."

332
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Okay? Peter stays up all night fishing, catches nothing. Check.

333
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Insert Jesus. Jesus shows up.

334
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 "Hey, put your nets on the other side of the boat. You guys caught anything?"

335
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 "No."

336
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 "Great. Put it on the other side."

337
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And what do they do?

338
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 They catch 153 fish.

339
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 The only difference between this story and what happened three years earlier is that this time the nets don't begin to tear.

340
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 It continues in verse 7. Look at what it says.

341
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 "That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, 'It is the Lord.'"

342
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 "When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment and pulled a forest gump.

343
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 He was stripped for work and threw himself into the sea."

344
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Lieutenant Dan!

345
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 "The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land but about a hundred yards off.

346
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place with fish laid out on it and bread.

347
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.'

348
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, 153 of them.

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And although there were so many, the net was not torn.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Jesus said to them, 'Come and have breakfast.'

351
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Now none of the disciples dared ask him, 'Who are you?'

352
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them.

353
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And so with the fish."

354
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.

355
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 There's so much going on here. I just want to highlight two things.

356
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So remember, Jesus has brought Peter back to the Sea of Galilee.

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Peter's just stayed up all night fishing, caught nothing.

358
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Jesus is doing exactly what he did with Peter three years earlier.

359
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Now what's interesting is Jesus brings them, brings Peter and the other disciples to a charcoal fire.

360
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 When's the last time Peter was around a charcoal fire?

361
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 On the night he betrayed Jesus.

362
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 The only other thing I want you to see is that Jesus already had fish on the fire,

363
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 which is pretty baller.

364
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 Because they just caught 153 fish,

365
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 it's as if Jesus is saying, "Y'all don't have anything that I need.

366
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And I have everything in myself.

367
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And yet I delight to have you with me and to share it with you."

368
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Which is really beautiful.

369
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Now watch this.

370
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Verses 15 through 17.

371
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 "When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,"

372
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 look at what he calls him, Simon,

373
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 when's the last time Jesus called him Simon?

374
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I don't know when the last time was,

375
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 but what did Jesus call him the first time?

376
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 He called him to follow him?

377
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 He called him Simon.

378
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"

379
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

380
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 He said to him, "Feed my lambs."

381
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

382
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

383
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 He said to him, "Tend my sheep."

384
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

385
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?"

386
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything.

387
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 You know that I love you."

388
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 How many times did Peter deny Jesus around that charcoal fire?

390
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Three times.

391
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 So what does Jesus do?

392
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He brings him to another charcoal fire,

393
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 and he asks him the same question three times, "Do you love me?"

394
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Why does he ask him it three times?

395
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 So that each denial could be replaced with an affirmation of Peter's love for Jesus.

396
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 See what Jesus is doing?

397
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 He's just saying, "Let's start over.

398
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Let's just start over.

399
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Let's just go back.

400
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Sea of Galilee.

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Up all night fishing.

402
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 You catch a bunch of fish.

403
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 I bring you to a charcoal fire.

404
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I call you Simon."

405
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And now, each denial is replaced with an affirmation.

406
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Jesus is giving him a new start.

407
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Why?

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Because Jesus is the author of new starts.

409
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 That's what he does.

410
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 What Jesus is doing here, don't miss it,

411
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 is he is exchanging Peter's story of failure for his story of forgiveness.

412
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 That's what Jesus is doing, is he is taking Peter's failure

413
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and replacing it with forgiveness and favor.

414
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Do you want to know why this moment between Jesus and Peter was possible?

415
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Do you want to know why Jesus was able to forgive Peter in this moment and restore him?

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 It's because sandwiched in between the two charcoal fires was the cross of Jesus Christ.

417
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And on that cross, what did Jesus do?

418
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 He bore all of Peter's sin and shame.

419
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Like the three denials, Jesus died for those denials.

420
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 When Jesus walked out of the tomb, he was conquering Peter's denials.

421
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 The apostle Paul explains really well what Jesus accomplished on the cross for you and for me.

422
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Listen to his wording in Colossians 2, 13 and 14.

423
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Paul says, "You were dead because of your sins."

424
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So if you're not a Christian in here,

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 you need to know that you might be physically alive,

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 but in God's eyes, you are spiritually dead.

427
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 You're not spiritually bad, you're spiritually dead.

428
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And it's impossible for dead people to do something pleasing for a holy God.

429
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away.

430
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Watch this.

431
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "Then God made you alive with Christ."

432
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 That's what Christianity is about.

433
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Christianity isn't about us coming together to figure out what we need to do for God.

434
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 It's us coming together to realize that when we could do nothing, God did everything.

435
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 "Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave..."

436
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 What's the next word?

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Now I want you to say it like you believe that the Bible is true.

438
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 "He forgave..."

439
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "All."

440
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 "All."

441
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 All of our sins.

442
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 All of them.

443
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 He canceled the record.

444
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 The record.

445
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He canceled the entire record of your sins.

446
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 He canceled the record of the charges against us.

447
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And he didn't just cancel it and look at what he did.

448
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He took it away by nailing it to the cross.

449
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 So this is where you have to get your theology right.

450
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Either Jesus has forgiven all of your sins or none of your sins.

451
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Period.

452
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Either all of them or none of them.

453
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 You choose what you believe.

454
00:29:51,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 But the reason that shame and regret will have their way in our lives is because we believe that Jesus forgives the sins that are easy to forgive,

455
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 but he really struggles to forgive the significant sins.

456
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 So this is where you have to realize that when Jesus went to the cross, he went to deal with the entire record.

457
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The entire record.

458
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 All of your failure.

459
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 It's either all of your sin or none of your sin.

460
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And you know what he's done is he has taken away...

461
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 So if you're not a Christian, I hope that you leave here truly understanding what's on the table for you tonight.

462
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Complete forgiveness of all your failures is on the table tonight.

463
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 But here's the good news is Jesus doesn't just take away the record of your sin.

464
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Do you know what Jesus does?

465
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Is he gives you his record of righteousness.

466
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Which is amazing.

467
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 So that when a holy and perfect God looks at you, do you know what he sees?

468
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 He doesn't just see that Jesus has taken away your sin.

469
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 He sees that Jesus has given you his righteousness.

470
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So when a perfect God looks at you, you know what he sees?

471
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 He sees Jesus in you.

472
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 So everything that God the Father feels towards Jesus his son, he now feels towards you.

473
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Like you get to experience the love and the delight that God the Father has for Jesus.

474
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Why? Because you are now, according to the scriptures, through faith you are in Christ.

475
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Which is amazing news.

476
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 So I tell you this just to say the cross must always be bigger than your failure.

477
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Always.

478
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Now, if you've wronged someone, go seek forgiveness.

479
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Go make it right.

480
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And I'll tell you this, like you don't have to forget about your past.

481
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You just have to put your past in the right place.

482
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Your past no longer has the right to remind you of what you've done.

483
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 It only has the right to remind you of what Jesus has done.

484
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Your past failure's only responsibility now is to display the beauty and the greatness of God's grace.

485
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 The third thing that I want you to know is this, your life can still glorify Jesus.

486
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 That's amazing news.

487
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Your life can still glorify Jesus.

488
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Look at what it tells us about Peter, verses 18 and 19.

489
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 So Jesus has just said three different times, "Do you love me?"

490
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Peter says, "Yes." He's like, "Feed my sheep. Tend my lambs."

491
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Do you know what he's telling him?

492
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 He's saying, "Peter, go play a significant role in the building of my church."

493
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Not a building, but a people.

494
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 So you fast forward to the book of Acts, and you know what you see?

495
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 You see Peter is the leader.

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Like, he's the one who stands up, and when he gives a sermon like I'm doing right now,

497
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 3,000 people trust Christ just like that.

498
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 So what Jesus is saying when he says, "Hey, go feed my sheep," he's saying, "Go, go lead.

499
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Go do something for my glory."

500
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Now watch what he says in verse 18.

501
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Jesus says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young,

502
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted.

503
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands,

504
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go."

505
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Verse 19, don't miss it.

506
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 "This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.

507
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And after saying this, he said to them, 'Follow me.'"

508
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Do you know what this is a reference to?

509
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Jesus right here is referring to the death Peter was going to die.

510
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Peter was going to die by crucifixion.

511
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Tradition tells us that he was even crucified upside down.

512
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But I want you to see the wording.

513
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 This is Jesus himself saying, "Look, right now I'm just talking about the death

514
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 that you are going to die to glorify me."

515
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Jesus himself is saying, "It is still possible for you, Peter, to glorify me."

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 And you know what's amazing is when you do go and read the book of Acts,

517
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 you know what the story of Peter's life becomes?

518
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Peter's story isn't, "I failed."

519
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Peter's story was, he was imperfect but faithful.

520
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Like he went out and he led for Jesus, and yet he still sinned.

521
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 He still struggled.

522
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Like there's a story where Paul has to call Peter out.

523
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 But the label of his life was not failure.

524
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 It was imperfect but faithful.

525
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And I'll just tell you this.

526
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Like I've got a wife and three kids.

527
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And when I die at my funeral, the greatest thing that anyone could say about me

528
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 is for my wife or my kids or my friends to stand up and say,

529
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 "You know what, Timothy Atik, he was an imperfect person.

530
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 He was very imperfect."

531
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 I want my wife to stand up there and say, "You know what, he was too moody sometimes.

532
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 He was imperfect, but he was faithful.

533
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 He was faithful to follow Jesus.

534
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 He was faithful to love his spouse.

535
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 He was faithful to love his kids.

536
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 He was faithful to love God's church.

537
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 He was imperfect but faithful."

538
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 There's nothing--there's not a bigger compliment that I could receive

539
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 or that you could receive.

540
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 I'd just tell you this to say your life can still glorify Jesus.

541
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 Don't let your limited perspective tell you what a limitless God can and can't do

542
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 in and through you.

543
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 You can still glorify God in dating.

544
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 You can still glorify God in marriage.

545
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 You can still glorify God as a parent.

546
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 You can still glorify God as a co-worker.

547
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 You can still glorify God as a boss or an employee.

548
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 I don't say this to minimize our sin.

549
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 I just say it to maximize the power of God's grace.

550
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And so you know what?

551
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Like you've heard me--if you've been at the porch for a while,

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 you've heard me share about my story of how I lived a compromising life

553
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 and I was working at a church and I had to step off of staff.

554
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 For the new people in the room, do you know what church that was?

555
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 Watermark Community Church.

556
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 It was this church that I had to sit with a room full of 50 to 60 staff

557
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 and just tell them about my sin.

558
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 It was at this church that I was asked to leave staff

559
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 and to step out of leadership for a period of time because of my sin.

560
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 And now God in his kindness and in his grace has brought me back.

561
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Why? Because he wasn't done with me.

562
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And so the reason I share my story is that I don't have a story to hide.

563
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 I have a story to tell.

564
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Because my story now, it's a trophy of God's grace.

565
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And I've told my story now to tens of thousands of people.

566
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 I've gotten to sit one-on-one with young adults

567
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and talk to them about my failures during that season.

568
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And I don't have to do it with shame in my heart.

569
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I do it free of shame.

570
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 Because now my past's only responsibility

571
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 is to remind me of just how great God's grace has been in my life.

572
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 It is a trophy of God's grace that I can stand up here tonight

573
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 and say, "I don't have a story to hide. You can know my past."

574
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 Because Jesus has restored me from my past.

575
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 He has redeemed me from it.

576
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 And the cross of Jesus Christ is capable to deal with all of our sin.

577
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 I hope you believe that tonight.

578
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 [applause]

579
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 So I just want to close by talking about how you respond to a message like this.

580
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Here it is.

581
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Peter ran to Jesus instead of running from Jesus.

582
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 You know what I love about Peter is that he denied Jesus three times,

583
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 and then when John looks at him and they're on the boat,

584
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 and he's like, "Hey, that's Jesus."

585
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 You know what Jesus--Peter does?

586
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 He flings himself into the water and just is like,

587
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 "I don't have time to wait for us to paddle there.

588
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 I want to get to Jesus now."

589
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Instead of running from him, he ran to him.

590
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 And here's what I love. When Peter came to Jesus,

591
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 what was the question that Jesus asked Peter?

592
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 "Do you promise you're never going to deny me again?"

593
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 It wasn't that question.

594
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Now, Peter, you're committed to going to church every week from here on out, right?

595
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 That's part of the deal.

596
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 It wasn't that question either.

597
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Peter, you're not going to embarrass me and screw up again, right?

598
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Not that question either.

599
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 What was the question?

600
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 "Do you love me?"

601
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 That's the question on the table for you tonight.

602
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 It's not, "Do you promise?"

603
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 It's not, "Can you find someone that screwed up worse than you?"

604
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 It's not, "How are you going to punish yourself to make things right?"

605
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 It's, "Do you love me?"

606
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 So here's the deal.

607
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ,

608
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 you are not a Christian.

609
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 If that's you, I just want you to know that when we talk about knowing Jesus,

610
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 what we're talking about is we're talking about knowing the one

611
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 who left heaven and came to earth and lived a perfect life

612
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 because we have lived very imperfect lives,

613
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 and he died the death that we all deserved to die for our sin.

614
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 But when he died, what he was doing, he was taking all of the punishment

615
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 that our failures deserved.

616
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 And then we believe that this Jesus, he walked out of the grave

617
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 as a demonstration that he was victorious over all of our failures.

618
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 So tonight, his victory can be your victory.

619
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Your life does not have to be defined by your failures.

620
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 It can be defined by his forgiveness and his favor towards you.

621
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 But it's only possible through faith.

622
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 It's only possible by you coming to a place where you talk to God

623
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 and you say, "Jesus, everything he's talking about, I want that to be true for me.

624
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 God, I give my life to you.

625
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 You can be in charge of my life.

626
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 Would you just come in? Would you be my Savior?

627
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Would you be my King? Would you rule in my life?

628
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 I give my life to you. If that is possible, if it's possible

629
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 for you to not just forgive me, but to give me the righteousness of Christ.

630
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 God, I want that.

631
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 If that's you, would you come to him tonight?

632
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 If you're here and you are a Christian, but you're running from Jesus right now

633
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 because you're running in your shame,

634
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 you're living under the banner of failure,

635
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 stop running. Stop running.

636
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 God in his love for you has brought you here

637
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 so that he could just ask you this question, "Do you love me?"

638
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 All you have to do is say, "I do love you, God. Forgive me."

639
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 And then you know what? If you've sought God for forgiveness

640
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 and yet you're still living in shame, let me just tell you what needs to happen.

641
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 You need to begin to agree with God about your sin.

642
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Because Jesus is saying tonight, "I canceled the record."

643
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 And yet when we let shame rule, you know what we're saying back to God?

644
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 We're saying, "Yeah, but what about my record?"

645
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 He's like, "I canceled it." It's like, "Yeah, but what about that sin on the record?"

646
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 He's like, "Yeah, I took it away." "Yeah, but I don't know about that sin."

647
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 We have to agree with him. You canceled the record.

648
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Because you, Jesus, are greater than my sin, and I trust you.

649
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 So would you come to him tonight?

650
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 Whatever it is, would you run towards Jesus,

651
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 and would you experience his grace and his forgiveness?

652
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Would you allow him to trade your story of failure

653
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 for his story of forgiveness and favor?

654
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Let's pray together.

655
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 I just want to ask, if you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian,

656
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 but everything I said just a minute ago makes sense,

657
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 and you're sitting there saying, "Yes, I want to begin a relationship with Jesus Christ tonight.

658
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 I want everything that you just said to be true to me."

659
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 If that's you, with eyes closed, would you slip up your hand real quick,

660
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 just so I know who I'm talking to in this place tonight?

661
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 Great. Awesome.

662
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Then if that's you, I just encourage you right now to pray and say,

663
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 "Lord Jesus, I want everything he just said.

664
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Would you come into my life?

665
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Would you forgive me of all of my sins?"

666
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Just tell him, "Thank you." Say, "Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

667
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

668
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Would you save me?

669
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And would you lead me in a new life?"

670
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 And then if you're here tonight, and you are a believer that's just been walking in shame,

671
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 like we sang a song earlier,

672
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 talking about witnessing the faithfulness of God,

673
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 and telling of his faithfulness, that's what I've done tonight,

674
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 is I've stood up here and I've told you,

675
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 I've witnessed the faithfulness of God in my own life to restore me from my sin,

676
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 and so I've testified about it to you.

677
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And I want that for you.

678
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 So maybe you just sit there and you thank God for his faithfulness

679
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 to cancel the record of your sins.

680
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 And then maybe you stand and you sing and you testify of his goodness

681
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 and his faithfulness in your life,

682
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 but don't just run out of here.

683
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Do business with the Lord now.

684
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 God, you are good.

685
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Thank you for your kindness in our lives.

686
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 That you don't give up on us.

687
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 That you're not even close to giving up on us.

688
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 You still love us.

689
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 You still pursue us.

690
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 I pray for people who carried shame in,

691
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 may they not carry it back out.

692
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 May they leave it here

693
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 and leave free.

694
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 We need you. We love you.

695
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Amen.
