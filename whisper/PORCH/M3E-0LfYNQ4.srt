1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
 Come on, come on.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,800
 Well it's summertime and so that means my little girl, my seven year old Presley's at

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,360
 home and my five year old Finley's there.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,580
 She starts kindergarten this year and my 22 month old Weston is there.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,400
 So every morning is kind of like Groundhog Day.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,320
 I wake up to the same scene over and over and over and I'll paint the scene for you.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,280
 Presley and Finley, they share a room, twin size, two twin size beds in there.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,940
 They wake up, okay.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,680
 They go to this little chest in the room and they put on princess outfits.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
 Okay.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,520
 So Presley puts on this purple gown and then Finley puts on this blue gown.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
 They put on these tiaras.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,360
 They are Elsa and Anna, if you know who that is.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,600
 And they walk around the house.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,760
 Let it go.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
 Let it go.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,360
 And they sing and to where I'm like, let it go.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,680
 I don't want to build a snowman for the first time in forever.

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
 Okay.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,440
 I don't want to do this anymore.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,600
 And so music is powerful.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,680
 It's powerful because what happens is I realized they're not just singing the song.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,680
 They want to be the person who sings the song at seven and five.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,800
 And I'm like, that's crazy.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,720
 And they want to be them and they're starting so young.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,400
 I mean, they want to be these princesses, these made up fictitious fairy tales.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,360
 And I'm like, that's crazy.

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:41,440
 Until I look back on my own life and for me, it wasn't frozen at five and seven.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,040
 It was a little group called new kids on the block in the second grade.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,080
 I wanted to be Jonathan Knight.

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
 We had the same name.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,800
 I had the same haircut.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 I put lines in my hair because I liked them so much.

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
 Some of you are like, who is new kids on the block?

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,200
 Tell you later.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
 Right.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,400
 And I realized that how powerful music is that it can, it can reflect our identity and

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,760
 even define it.

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,400
 As I look at back at different snapshots of my life, different seasons, right?

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
 Who I was often was reflective of what I was listening to.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,040
 It's hard to tell what comes first.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,680
 I think both kind of happened simultaneously.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,920
 So new kids on the block in the second grade.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,080
 And then after that, I wanted to be just like my older sister and I wanted to be like her

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
 so much.

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,920
 I started listening to Metallica and guns and roses and the very same things that she

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
 listened to.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,160
 So this was kind of the November rain season.

49
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,280
 And then I found girls and I loved girls.

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,480
 And so I loved guys who sung about girls and, and I thought I was this helpless romantic

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,120
 and I took affection to shy and Joe to see and soul for real and boys to men, the great

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,760
 boys to men.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 And I'm singing these songs.

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,200
 I remember walking through the mall, just going up to strange, no very first time that

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,380
 I saw you and just like, you know, that's, that's what I wanted to be.

56
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,760
 That's who I was that identity.

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,820
 And then it went, you know, a little bit darker from there.

58
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,240
 This was kind of the really confused era of my life.

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,480
 I began to listen to rap and not just rap like gangster, hardcore, bad rap.

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 And I thought I was a thug.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,180
 I was a wannabe gangster, wannabe thug, you know, and I was listening to DJ screw and

62
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,280
 ghetto boys and scar face and bone thugs and, and all of this.

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,800
 And I looked back on that time and I realized, you know, I had the, the gold chain, the big

64
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,480
 Nike, you know, and it was confused.

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
 I needed your, I needed your prayer.

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:50,840
 I had the 1979 Mercedes Benz with hydraulics that super fly on the back, true story.

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,500
 And then to further define the identity crisis, I kind of got my act together.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,480
 And so then there were some even darker days, began to listen to country.

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
 It was Garth Brooks and George Strait.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
 We would go dancing in my small town on the weekends.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,160
 I bought some Wranglers and some Justin Ropers lace ups were the big thing at the time.

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,840
 And this is what I was jamming to.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,480
 And then some even darker days was in sync.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,760
 Backstreet boys are all for one.

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,880
 I was confused, man.

76
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,080
 It's a confused brother, but music, it doesn't just reflect our identity.

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,320
 It often defines it.

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,840
 I believe it does both.

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,400
 And there's power in these words that we listen to.

80
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,880
 Sometimes we don't even fully understand the message.

81
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,120
 And there was a time in the church when the best music that is out there came out of the

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
 church.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,080
 It would flow out of the church since then, Hollywood and Nashville and places like that

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,040
 have claimed it for themselves, places like New York.

85
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,360
 And some of the music that we listen to every day actually flows out of those places, which

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
 is fine.

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,080
 But when we're listening to it, it's not okay when we start to believe it.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,120
 And if you think I sound like your parents right now, I just want you to consider the

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,560
 different seasons of your life and how music that you listen to might reflect your identity.

90
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,320
 Martin Luther says this next to the word of God, music deserves the highest praise.

91
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,160
 It controls our thoughts, minds, hearts, and spirits.

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,480
 There's a reason that we worship God in song and that we sing to him because it is often

93
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,340
 a reflection of our hearts, minds, and spirits.

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,240
 And if that's what we do when we sing songs about God and to God, we call that worship.

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,040
 Then what we do in the car often would be idol worship, worshiping false idols, believing

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
 false ideas.

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,200
 And that's why we're doing this series called Lyrics and Lies.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,260
 We're listening to the very songs that we love, very songs that our peers love, songs

99
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,880
 we listen to every day.

100
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,640
 And we're going to look at the meaning and the biblical truths that are in them or the

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,920
 ideas that come from them that combat truths of the eternal scriptures that we say this

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,320
 is ultimate truth.

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,200
 This is ultimate authority from God's word.

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,160
 And so that's where we'll be just the next few weeks.

105
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,760
 And tonight we're going to look at a song by Ella Maria Lani Yellich O'Connor.

106
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,400
 Anybody know who that is?

107
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,920
 There's a reason she goes by Lord.

108
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
 Okay.

109
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,340
 She's got a long, confusing name and her song Royals was the number one hit when she was

110
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,340
 17 or 16, 17 years old.

111
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,340
 I'm sorry.

112
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
 16 years old.

113
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,900
 It was an international hit.

114
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,180
 She's from New Zealand.

115
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,100
 And this is what it says.

116
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,940
 I've never seen a diamond in the flesh.

117
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,540
 I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies, and I'm not proud of my address in a torn

118
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,020
 up town.

119
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,340
 No postcard envy.

120
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:03,020
 I'm going to try not to sing, but it's catchy, but every song is like gold teeth, gray goose

121
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,420
 tripping in the bathroom, blood stains, ball gowns, trash in the hotel room.

122
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
 We don't care.

123
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,700
 We're driving Cadillacs in our dreams, but everybody's like crystal Maybach diamonds

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,460
 on your time piece, jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.

125
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,540
 And we don't care.

126
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,300
 We aren't caught up in your love affair.

127
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,380
 We'll never be Royals.

128
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,700
 It don't run in our blood.

129
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,520
 That kind of Lux just ain't for us.

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,540
 We crave a different kind of buzz.

131
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,460
 Let me be your ruler.

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,660
 You can call me queen bee and baby, I'll rule.

133
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,660
 Let me live that fantasy.

134
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,780
 You've heard the song, I'm sure, but do you know the message?

135
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,820
 Lord is saying, and there's a great irony here.

136
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,940
 Lord is saying, Hey, all these rappers are, are, are rolling around in their cars, uh,

137
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,300
 sipping gray goose trash in the hotel room.

138
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,580
 And I'll never be that.

139
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,940
 I know that I'll never be that.

140
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,100
 Now the very song that she's saying about not being that enabled her to be that.

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
 Okay.

142
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,420
 That's the great irony here is this song was number one.

143
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,940
 She was one of the youngest ladies ever to be number one on the billboard charts.

144
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,820
 And so the song that she sings about, Hey, I don't want to be that.

145
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
 I'll never be that.

146
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,420
 That's not available to me is the very song that kind of ushered that lifestyle to her

147
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,460
 so much so that in her last MTV interview, she said, yeah, I trashed the hotel room last

148
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
 night.

149
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,100
 She has become the very thing she didn't.

150
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,780
 She said, Hey, I'll never be that.

151
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,780
 And it's just a recreation.

152
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
 Solomon says, there's nothing new under the sun.

153
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,940
 Uh, maybe you listened to Weezer back in the day, Beverly Hills, you guys don't Beverly

154
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,420
 Hills, you know, that's where I want to be.

155
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,780
 And he says, I don't have a chance to live like Kings in Beverly Hills.

156
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,060
 And the same thing, the song that they sung about, they said, Hey, we'll never be.

157
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,060
 That was the very thing that enabled them to be that as it became a hit.

158
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,180
 That identity to go back to that, what you believe you will be.

159
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,740
 And more importantly, who you are, who Christ has made, you will often define the trajectory

160
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
 of your life.

161
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:07,900
 It is who you will become the way others see you, the dream they have for you.

162
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,180
 And see, I think that for a lot of us, the problem is not that we don't believe in Jesus.

163
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,820
 You're here, you're in a church on a Tuesday night, praise God.

164
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,700
 You're singing love songs to the King of Kings.

165
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,860
 I think your problem, most of you is not that you don't believe in Jesus.

166
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,020
 It's that you don't believe that he's at work within you.

167
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,260
 You don't believe that he has more for you, that he wants something greater for you.

168
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,460
 So many of us are disappointed in who we are or who we are becoming.

169
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,020
 And we're at that crossroads in our lives.

170
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,060
 We just did a series called quarter life crisis where we're actually dying to our dreams.

171
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,500
 We're realizing, hey, I'll never be that.

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,940
 And so we settle, just like Lord said in our songs, hey, I'll never be that.

173
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,980
 So I'll settle for something less.

174
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,660
 I'll never be royals.

175
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,700
 I don't need to be that.

176
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,900
 It doesn't run in my blood.

177
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,220
 And so I'll just settle for something else.

178
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:12,500
 But our problems come from not understanding who we were created to be.

179
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 And without knowing who we actually are, we cannot know our purpose.

180
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,420
 And I want you to listen closely to the statement.

181
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,820
 I can think of no greater tragedy than talent without purpose.

182
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,220
 Let me say that again.

183
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,540
 I can think of no greater tragedy than talent without purpose.

184
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,100
 And that lack of purpose comes from not understanding who you are, who you were created to be, what

185
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,820
 you've been claimed as by God, the most powerful being in the universe.

186
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,700
 And so tonight we're talking about what it means to be royals, a message on identity.

187
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,220
 We're going to go down a path through a scripture and discuss who royals are, what we were before

188
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,820
 being royals, and what it means to be royals, what we do as royals.

189
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,900
 And so I'm going to be in 1 Peter chapter 2.

190
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
 If you want to turn there, I'll start in verse 9.

191
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,780
 1 Peter was written in 64 AD from Peter, who spent some time with Jesus.

192
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,460
 You've heard his name probably.

193
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,900
 He wrote this letter from Rome.

194
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,380
 What's interesting about that in Rome in 64 AD, Nero is the emperor.

195
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,940
 Nero was a wicked, wicked man.

196
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,980
 He hated Christians.

197
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,140
 We've talked about him in the past here.

198
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
 And so Nero, he was kind of crazy.

199
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,060
 And so one thing strange that he did in history, we can read this in history books, is he actually

200
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,600
 set Rome on fire.

201
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,220
 There was a terrible fire in Rome.

202
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,180
 Nero, the emperor started it.

203
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,380
 You say, why would he do that?

204
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,460
 Well, he actually then blamed Christians.

205
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,860
 This small group of people called the way.

206
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,620
 And the reason Nero lit Rome on fire and blamed Christians is because Nero said that Christians

207
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,060
 hated humanity.

208
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,820
 Now why would Nero say Christians hate humanity?

209
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
 Here's why.

210
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,120
 Because Christians wouldn't worship false gods.

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
 They wouldn't worship idols.

212
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,120
 Now to Nero, these idols were the ones who allowed for fertility.

213
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,700
 These idols were the ones who would allow for rain or good weather or crops to grow.

214
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,860
 And so the fact that Christians wouldn't worship them, and he translated, Hey, they hate humans.

215
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
 They hate humanity.

216
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,760
 They don't want the human race to prosper, these Christians.

217
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,780
 And so what he would do being a wicked man is he would actually stitch animal skin to

218
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,500
 Christians and then he would unleash dogs on them for fun and watch dogs, rip them to

219
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 pieces.

220
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,620
 He would, he had this statue built and he would take Christians and he would dip them

221
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,540
 in oil and he would light, set them on fire so that they could illuminate a statue of

222
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
 himself.

223
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,460
 And he would have fun torturing Christians.

224
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,180
 There's a really, really wicked man.

225
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:41,020
 But Peter wrote this message to the persecuted church, to Christians who are under persecution,

226
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,100
 living in a broken world that they do not belong to.

227
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:53,860
 He said this, but you porch Dallas, you are a chosen people, a Royal priesthood, a holy

228
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,940
 nation, God's special possession that you may declare the praises of him who called

229
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,340
 you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

230
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,680
 Peter, God through Peter writes to you, you are Royal.

231
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
 You are important.

232
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,260
 You have infinite worth given to you by God, the creator, the one who made everything you

233
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,180
 see made you and he made you for a purpose.

234
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,580
 You are a Royal priesthood, a holy nation of people belonging to God set apart for his

235
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,500
 purpose.

236
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,880
 And so my first point is Royals know who they are.

237
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
 This is who you are.

238
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,420
 This is what the scripture says.

239
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,980
 You are, when I say you, I don't mean you.

240
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,740
 I mean you specifically, you are chosen.

241
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,900
 God's chosen people among all creations.

242
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
 He creates everything.

243
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,980
 He creates animals, he creates humans, and then he brings, he calls some of them into

244
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,860
 relationship with him.

245
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,860
 He ignites your heart.

246
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,460
 He did it in spite of you.

247
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:56,580
 He chose you, which begs the question, well, what if he didn't choose me, JP?

248
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,660
 What if I'm not chosen?

249
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,840
 What if he didn't choose me?

250
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,540
 What if he didn't recruit me to be on his team?

251
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:08,480
 Let me ask you to consider something where you're at right now on a Tuesday night.

252
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,500
 It seems like he's after you.

253
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 Okay.

254
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,100
 It seems like he has a message he wants you to hear.

255
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,260
 He's looking at you and he's saying, Hey, I choose you.

256
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,860
 I want you to play on my team.

257
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,620
 And he says, I want to identify who you are.

258
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,020
 You are a royal priesthood.

259
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,540
 Lord said you'll never be royals.

260
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:34,260
 The Lord, King of Kings, Jesus said, you're royal.

261
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,660
 He made you royal and that this is who you are.

262
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,980
 You might be like, I'm Catholic, I'm Baptist, I'm Methodist.

263
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,140
 I'm non-denominational, I'm spiritual, but not religious.

264
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,780
 You might have all these words to identify yourself.

265
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,900
 God says, no, you are a part of the royal priesthood.

266
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,380
 And there's something in us that longs for this.

267
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,700
 You can look at my seven year old and my five year old who wakes up every day and dresses

268
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
 like princesses.

269
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,300
 And you're like, yeah, that's seven and five year olds.

270
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,780
 Listen, this moves throughout your life.

271
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,660
 Ladies, you always want to be a princess, whether it's a quintillion, a quinceañera,

272
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,500
 a prom, any excuse to dress up like a princess.

273
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,540
 Dare I say wedding?

274
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,380
 Okay.

275
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,700
 Any excuse to dress up like a princess.

276
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,020
 Guys, you're here and you're like, man, I just don't understand girls.

277
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,460
 I want to know what they want.

278
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,660
 Let me tell you guys, I'm going to let you in on a secret what they want.

279
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,380
 They want to be treated like princesses.

280
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,060
 Whether they're five, 25 or 55 years old, they desire, ladies are nodding their head.

281
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,140
 Guys, I'm telling you, they desire to be treated like princesses.

282
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
 This is what they want.

283
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,660
 And don't get me to talk about my 22 month old son who will take any opportunity he can

284
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,500
 to grab a sword and slay something.

285
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,860
 Okay.

286
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,460
 There is something in us that longs for this story.

287
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,780
 Do you know what the gospel message is?

288
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,540
 Do you want to look at creation?

289
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:02,500
 It's the four point gospel presentation, creation, fall, redemption, restoration, creation, fall,

290
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,740
 redemption, restoration.

291
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:11,540
 This is the message that Disney has made a trillion dollars on creation, fall, redemption,

292
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,540
 restoration.

293
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,220
 Are you ready?

294
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,660
 There's a king who has brought peace to a land.

295
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,180
 There's an evil force that put a curse on the land.

296
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
 It's fallen.

297
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,540
 The king is gone.

298
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,420
 The land is fallen.

299
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,020
 The king is going to come back.

300
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,620
 He comes back, he slays evil, and then he restores the peace in the land.

301
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:38,860
 You need not look past Braveheart or Frozen or Snow White or Cinderella or whatever movie,

302
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,020
 epic movie you can think of, creation, fall, redemption, restoration.

303
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,540
 It is the very story that has been written on our hearts.

304
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,820
 There's a reason that we long for this because it's inside of you.

305
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,380
 There's a reason that you long to be a princess because you are one.

306
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:00,260
 Jesus says you are one, and only the king can tell you you're a princess, and it's something

307
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,500
 that can't be taken away from you once you've been adopted into that royalty.

308
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,700
 See, some of our problems, our main problem, dare I say, is that we've forgotten who we

309
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:18,460
 are, or maybe you never knew your royalty.

310
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:24,700
 A royal priesthood, a people belonging to God, a holy nation, he says.

311
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,380
 I have identified what you're a part of.

312
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,860
 You've been set apart for God, and so you use these words to identify you.

313
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:45,700
 I'm an American, or I'm a CPA, or I'm an Aggies, dop, right?

314
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:54,460
 Or I'm a Tridel, or I'm a finance major, or I'm on this team, or I went to school here,

315
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,820
 or I know this, or I can do this, or I work here, or this is my occupation.

316
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,460
 All these things that you try to identify you as that aren't necessarily bad, but there's

317
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,860
 only one that's eternal.

318
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,300
 There's only one that will matter a thousand years from now.

319
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:14,660
 You're a holy nation, a people belonging to God, a royal priesthood, a Christian, a follower

320
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,780
 of Jesus Christ, the one true God.

321
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,460
 It's the only one that will matter a thousand years ago.

322
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,100
 It's the only title that you will carry with you.

323
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
 God, I'm yours.

324
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,300
 I don't belong to anybody else.

325
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
 I belong to you.

326
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
 You created me.

327
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:33,620
 I was made by you for you that I might live for you.

328
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,020
 You are, the scripture says, God's special possession.

329
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,340
 This identifies who you belong to.

330
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,020
 God, the creator of the heavens and the earth says, "I choose you as royal and holy.

331
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,580
 You are mine."

332
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,620
 This means something if God's choosing you.

333
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,620
 This means something.

334
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,100
 If I choose you, listen, I'm weak.

335
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,700
 There's not a whole lot I can do with you.

336
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,900
 If I choose you to be on my team, that doesn't really matter much.

337
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,260
 If God, the creator of the heavens and the earth, chooses you to be on his team, it means

338
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
 something.

339
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,540
 But you have to play on his team.

340
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,740
 You're not just sitting on his team.

341
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,740
 You're not just riding the bench on his team.

342
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,340
 There's things he wants to do through you.

343
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,420
 There's a reason that he's recruited you to his team, that you're a part of this holy

344
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,020
 people, that he has set you apart in the world.

345
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,860
 Paul says that you would stand in the world like a star in contrast to a dark night.

346
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,740
 Some of us just look like the dark night.

347
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,980
 There's no contrast.

348
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,300
 That's what's confusing about Dallas Christianity.

349
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,500
 I've never been great at sports.

350
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 Let me strike that.

351
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,900
 I've never been decent at sports at all, which is sad.

352
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
 What a waste of height.

353
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
 I know.

354
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
 I'm 6'7".

355
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,340
 I've been 6'7" as long as I can remember.

356
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,180
 I came out the womb 6'7".

357
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,820
 I'm just not very good at basketball.

358
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
 People would say, "Oh, where do you play basketball?"

359
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
 I'd say, "At Doan."

360
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
 They'd say, "What a waste of height."

361
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
 I'd say, "Oh, thanks for that compliment.

362
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,460
 I appreciate that."

363
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,500
 There was this basketball tournament that First Baptist Quero put on.

364
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,260
 Quero was never good at basketball because we were good at football.

365
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
 That means we weren't good at basketball.

366
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,780
 Except for one year, we were really good at basketball.

367
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,220
 It was the year of the Dream Team because there were two guys that played on the team.

368
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,860
 Their names were Michael and David.

369
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
 They were awesome.

370
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,740
 I mean, NBA worthy awesome.

371
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,420
 I remember David would throw the ball off the back wall behind the backboard.

372
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,900
 Michael would jump from the free throw line and windmill dunk Aliyah just sick.

373
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,180
 You just watched him all day.

374
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,180
 That's unbelievable.

375
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,860
 They were that good.

376
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,900
 They played in this tournament First Baptist Quero put on.

377
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,820
 For whatever reason, they probably felt sorry for me or maybe they thought I was good because

378
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,900
 I was tall, but they said, "Hey, we want you to be on our team."

379
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,300
 We dominated.

380
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,580
 Why did we dominate?

381
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,580
 For two reasons.

382
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,100
 One, because of whose team I was on.

383
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,740
 They were really, really good.

384
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,300
 Two, because they believed in me.

385
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,940
 They didn't say, "Hey, just come on our team and sit on the bench."

386
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
 No, we all had to play.

387
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,540
 I said, "No, bro, you're playing in the game.

388
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
 Listen, you can do this.

389
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,780
 Let me tell you what to do."

390
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,660
 We dominated because they thought I was good.

391
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,580
 I actually was decent.

392
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:06,580
 God, the creator of the heavens and the earth, he looks at you and he says, "I don't want

393
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,740
 you to waste your gifts and talents on you.

394
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,100
 That would be such a waste because you're just going to go in the ground.

395
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,260
 The dust you will return.

396
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,420
 I've given you those gifts and talents because I want you to play on my team.

397
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,580
 There's some things I want to do through you."

398
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,700
 You're so distracted by Dallas right now.

399
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,220
 Distracted by that relationship, by that job, by that six-figure income, by the pursuit

400
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,140
 of that car or that apartment.

401
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,620
 I don't want you to be distracted.

402
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,740
 I want you to stand apart in all that stuff.

403
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,140
 Be different than all that stuff.

404
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,820
 I want to use you.

405
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,980
 I've got plans for you, man.

406
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,380
 He says, "I promise you an inheritance."

407
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,300
 God always keeps his promises.

408
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,700
 You know what you're playing for.

409
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,020
 You know there's something at the end of all of this.

410
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,500
 He says this, verse 10, "Once you were not a people, but now you are a people of God,

411
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,620
 belonging to God.

412
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,180
 Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy."

413
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,940
 My second point is that royals know where they came from.

414
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
 Royals know where they came from.

415
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,260
 That means what you've been saved from.

416
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,700
 What that means is there's been a change in your life.

417
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,380
 That at some point you look backwards and the scripture would say about you, "I was

418
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,900
 an object of wrath."

419
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,060
 What that means, in case there's any confusion, at some point in your past you were headed

420
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,780
 towards hell.

421
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,660
 You weren't going to be with God.

422
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,900
 Then God, in his mercy, in spite of you and who you are, because he can, saved you in

423
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
 spite of you.

424
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,580
 He said, "No, I want you to come play on my team, bro.

425
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,180
 We're going to be together forever.

426
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,300
 I didn't just call you home to be with me right then.

427
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,820
 I've left you there so that I can do some things through you.

428
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,820
 I can accomplish some things through you."

429
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,580
 What this means is at one point you were not under God's mercy.

430
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,100
 Now you've received God's mercy.

431
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,760
 You've been given a promise through Christ, his death and resurrection for the forgiveness

432
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,500
 of your sins that you will be with him forever.

433
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,340
 As a promise, as a seal, he's given you, he's deposited with you his Holy Spirit so that

434
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,400
 he can do incredible works through you as you avail yourself to him and not be distracted

435
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,420
 by the world, not get caught up in the current of the world, not sit back and say, "Well,

436
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,420
 I'll never be royals, so I might as well do this."

437
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,780
 He says, "No, no, no, no.

438
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
 You are.

439
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
 Not you will be.

440
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,460
 You are right now.

441
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,660
 In this world, I'm going to reclaim it from evil.

442
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
 I'm coming back.

443
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,800
 Redemption is on its way.

444
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,500
 Restoration is on its way.

445
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,660
 Play as though you're on the winning team because you are.

446
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,980
 Read the back of the book if you haven't yet.

447
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,060
 See how this game ends."

448
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,900
 And he says, "Let's go, man."

449
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,780
 See, the problem with Christianity in Dallas is it's so diluted.

450
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,860
 It's like a country club.

451
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,340
 It's like this thing that you go to.

452
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,900
 In Dallas, Christian is a hobby.

453
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
 God is a hobby.

454
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,420
 God in the scriptures, somebody told me today, God in the scriptures is always king, but

455
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,540
 in Dallas, for some reason, he's a hobby.

456
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,060
 In the scriptures, he's always king.

457
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,380
 Anytime you see God, he's king.

458
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,500
 He's king of the universe, but here he's a hobby.

459
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,140
 Something I go to, where my friends go to, and I like the preaching and the singing,

460
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
 and it's fun.

461
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,620
 I get to get dressed up to go there, kind of like the club.

462
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,060
 If church is a hobby, then there's no hope for the evil in the world, but when you realize

463
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,980
 that you are the church, that it's your identity, you look at the evil in the world and you

464
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,340
 say, "Oh, the solution is within me.

465
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,460
 The solution to those problems, I have them.

466
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,700
 They are within me."

467
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,700
 Christianity always means, if you're a Christian, it always means there's been a change in your

468
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
 life.

469
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,900
 I've told a story before about getting in a fight once.

470
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,460
 It was the worst day of my entire life, what that looked like.

471
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
 I was at a neighboring school.

472
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
 It was not my school.

473
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,460
 I was there very much alone.

474
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,340
 I got in a fight with a dude, which ended up being a fight with a lot of dudes, and

475
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,580
 it just did not go well for me.

476
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,940
 I was teaching this past week at a family camp.

477
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,700
 I'm sitting there and I'm teaching the parents and teaching from the scriptures.

478
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,780
 Afterwards, this guy comes up.

479
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
 He's from Victoria.

480
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:25,260
 We're talking about who we know and people we know and have in common and places we've

481
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
 been and whatnot.

482
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,220
 We're catching up, and that comes up somehow.

483
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,260
 He's like, "You look like that wannabe thug that got in that fight that time after the

484
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
 basketball game."

485
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,860
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah, that's because I'm him.

486
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
 That was me."

487
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
 He's like, "What?

488
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,860
 What?

489
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,860
 No, no, but you've been reading the Bible.

490
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
 What?"

491
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,860
 He goes, "What happened to you?"

492
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,900
 I was like, "Bro, Jesus happened to me.

493
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
 That's it.

494
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,220
 I got nothing to boast in, but God came in my life and changed me, captured my heart.

495
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,820
 I was that guy, but there's been a change.

496
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,340
 I realized who I was created to be, for Christ."

497
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,300
 It's the same person you were created to be for Christ.

498
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,220
 You don't want to waste your gifts and talents.

499
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,780
 I know no greater tragedy than talents without purpose.

500
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
 You have a purpose.

501
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,220
 It comes from who you are.

502
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:29,340
 It flows out of who you are.

503
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,380
 He's calling you to rid yourself of the sin that so easily entangles you.

504
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,420
 The whole chapter we're in, it starts out like this.

505
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,900
 It's 1 Peter 2, verse 1.

506
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,340
 It says, "Therefore, rid yourself of all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy, envy and slander

507
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,500
 of every kind."

508
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 Then he says, "How?"

509
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,780
 He says, "Like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk that you would grow in the word so that

510
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,480
 you might grow up in your salvation so that you have tasted that the Lord is good."

511
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,620
 Now that you have tasted the Lord is good, that you would not stay where you're at.

512
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,060
 Not like, "Hey, I'm a Christian and I'm just going to stay right here."

513
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,060
 But that no, there would be a conversion in your life and then you would grow.

514
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,060
 You're like, "Well, I don't know the Bible."

515
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,060
 That's what that guy told me.

516
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,060
 He's like, "Man, how do you know the Bible?

517
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
 You were that wannabe thug."

518
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,260
 I was like, "Well, I just started.

519
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,860
 Somebody sat me down and started teaching it to me."

520
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,860
 That's what needs to happen.

521
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,860
 If you're here and you're like, "Man, I don't know the Bible.

522
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,140
 It's like a relevant book written thousands of years."

523
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
 No, it's called discipleship.

524
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,260
 You've got to start right now.

525
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
 You start somewhere.

526
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,620
 Have someone teach this to you.

527
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,760
 If you crave it like spiritual milk, there will be a change called sanctification that

528
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,200
 happens in your life as God takes what he made and begins to make you like him.

529
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,840
 That you begin to become the reality that you already are.

530
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,240
 I know that's confusing.

531
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,880
 You're royal right now and God, because he stands outside of time, is making you royal.

532
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,040
 You're co-heir with Jesus that you would inherit the world.

533
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,160
 This is your inheritance as he comes and makes a new earth here for you that you would live

534
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
 in for how long?

535
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,600
 Forever and ever and ever with him.

536
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,560
 It's awesome.

537
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:07,680
 He says this, "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to abstain from sinful

538
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,400
 desires which wage war against your soul.

539
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,880
 Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they

540
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,920
 may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us."

541
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,080
 My third and final point is royals show who they serve.

542
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,960
 Some of you, you're here and you're hearing this message, you're like, "I'm a royal.

543
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,960
 That's weird.

544
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
 I don't even know what that means.

545
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,280
 Somebody invited me to the porch and this dude's telling me that I'm a king.

546
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,880
 That's odd."

547
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,400
 I'm glad you're here.

548
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,200
 I know that some of you are here and you're like, "Yeah, I get it.

549
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
 I am."

550
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,800
 But you're going to leave here and like a dog to his vomit, you're going to return to

551
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,680
 that sin that so easily entangles you.

552
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
 You're going to return to that website.

553
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
 You're going to return to that bar.

554
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,040
 You're going to return to that drink that you like that you know you have too many of.

555
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 You're going to return to that relationship where you know you've gone too far and your

556
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,720
 friend said, "Hey, he's no good for you."

557
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
 You're going to return to that mall where you buy those things you can't afford because

558
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,040
 you find identity in them and you're broke but you think you're sex in the city or whatever.

559
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,920
 You're going to return to those things.

560
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,720
 You're going to return to those things.

561
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,760
 It's not any different, and everybody's seen this story play out, than the girl who had

562
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,760
 the abusive boyfriend, the guy who was no good for her, he was verbally abusive to her.

563
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,040
 You look at her and look at him and like, "How did that even happen?"

564
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,440
 Everyone's telling her, "Hey, he's no good for you.

565
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
 You're better than that."

566
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,360
 But the problem is she doesn't believe it, so she keeps going back.

567
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,880
 You sit her down and you're like, "No, sweetheart.

568
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
 You don't understand.

569
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,720
 He's no good for you.

570
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,880
 You're better than that."

571
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,640
 But the problem is she doesn't believe it, so she goes back to that.

572
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 That's what you need to hear.

573
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,600
 That's what Jesus is telling you right now, is you're better than that.

574
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,160
 Sin that you keep running back to.

575
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,240
 You don't have a sin problem, you have an identity problem.

576
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,880
 That's not who you are.

577
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
 You're not the loose girl anymore.

578
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,560
 You're not the slut they called you.

579
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
 You're not Cash McMogelson, buddy.

580
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
 You're not that dude.

581
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,560
 You're not the one who's finding identity in Dallas, walking around like you're Johnny

582
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,720
 Dallas and you own everything.

583
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
 That's not who you are anymore.

584
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,040
 You're not the ladies man anymore.

585
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,120
 You were that person, that's not who you are anymore.

586
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,480
 "Well, I'm the guy.

587
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,680
 I'm just the life of the party."

588
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
 No, you're not.

589
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,880
 You're a royal.

590
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,840
 Act like a royal, the one you've been called to.

591
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
 That's who you are.

592
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,840
 "You don't know me, man.

593
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
 I'm a fighter.

594
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,400
 You better not say that."

595
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,440
 No, you're not, buddy.

596
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,920
 You're God's son, bro.

597
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,360
 You're prince.

598
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,240
 All this is going to be yours one day, but right now you're doing a really good job of

599
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,040
 trying to screw that up, living for yourself.

600
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,680
 "Oh, you think those gifts and talents were given to you for you?"

601
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,520
 No, they weren't, ma'am.

602
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,800
 No, they weren't.

603
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,080
 God gave you those for him.

604
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
 As a royal, you know who you serve.

605
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,320
 You serve the one true God.

606
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,440
 You're in this world as strangers and aliens, a world that you do not belong to.

607
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,000
 And it says, "Abstain from sinful desires which wage war against your soul," which just

608
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,880
 sounds difficult.

609
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,800
 But he's telling you, "I've given you my spirit.

610
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,960
 You're no longer a slave to sin," or maybe he hasn't.

611
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,320
 Man, he wants to right now.

612
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,200
 That's why you're here, that you would trust in Christ for the forgiveness of sins and

613
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,920
 that you would live for him, no longer being a slave to sin but a slave to the one true

614
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,040
 God.

615
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,960
 And what you need to hear right now is who you are.

616
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,040
 This is this message.

617
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,960
 I've seen it preached through TV.

618
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,840
 I've seen it preached through movies.

619
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,000
 I've seen it preached through my own life and even in my parenting.

620
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,560
 There's this incredible scene in Blood Diamond where his son is taken over by the rebel army,

621
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,280
 where they get his son addicted to drugs and they make a child soldier out of him.

622
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,160
 This actually happens.

623
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,640
 And it's depicted in this movie.

624
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,140
 And he comes up and the dad is trying to rescue the son from the rebel army.

625
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,800
 And the son actually pulls a gun on his own father because he doesn't recognize him and

626
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 he's a soldier now.

627
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,240
 He's a child soldier and he kills anyone that would oppose the rebel army.

628
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,520
 They've brainwashed him.

629
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,840
 This is what Satan does to you.

630
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,000
 And it's this powerful scene where he says, "Hey, this is not who you are.

631
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,240
 You are D'Avandy.

632
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,120
 You are my son.

633
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,920
 Your mom waits for you.

634
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,560
 The cows long for you.

635
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,780
 You are a good boy.

636
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,960
 You are a good son.

637
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,760
 This is not who you are."

638
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,800
 This is the message that Christ has for you.

639
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:48,480
 When girls have been trafficked through sex traffickers and pimps due to a thing called

640
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,420
 Stockholm Syndrome, they often don't want to leave the pimp.

641
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,600
 It's all they know.

642
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,520
 They've been fed drugs through him.

643
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,280
 They've been brainwashed through him.

644
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,480
 And so these people have to come in rescuing these girls to take them back to their loving

645
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,540
 parents and their pretty lives.

646
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,160
 They have to unbrainwash them.

647
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,440
 And so they show up and they say, "No, he's not good.

648
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
 You don't understand.

649
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,760
 He wants to kill you.

650
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,880
 He wants to kill you.

651
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,080
 Your mom and your dad, they're waiting for you.

652
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,360
 Your grandmother and grandfather are waiting for you.

653
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,680
 You have a home and a white picket fence and they have this for you.

654
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
 It's ready for you.

655
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
 You have a life.

656
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,280
 We're ready to take you home."

657
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,760
 And often the girls don't want to go with them.

658
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,320
 They want to stay in the slavery of getting raped for profit every day.

659
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,400
 I know that's harsh words.

660
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,720
 I know, but that's the truth.

661
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,400
 And so I'm telling you the truth.

662
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,120
 And this is what Jesus is saying, "Hey, this is not who you are.

663
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,240
 I have something better for you."

664
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,880
 I parent through this idea.

665
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,600
 My girls, when they do something, the other day we were outside and Presley had a granola

666
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,740
 bar and she just took off the wrapper and threw it on the ground and began to eat the

667
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
 granola bar.

668
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,920
 And I just, I stopped down, I get down and I said, "Presley, I don't say that's not what

669
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
 you do."

670
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
 Or at least I don't start there.

671
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,200
 I say, "Presley, that's not who we are.

672
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
 We're not litterers, okay?

673
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,600
 God has put us here temporarily.

674
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,220
 We're going to leave this place better than we found it.

675
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,560
 That's not what we do because that's not who we are, Presley.

676
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,040
 And that's what you got to hear right now.

677
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,080
 You're sleeping with that dude.

678
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
 That's not who you are, man.

679
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,840
 You need to get wasted.

680
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
 That's not who you are.

681
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,040
 Oh, you think you're better than everybody else?

682
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,920
 No, God saved you in spite of you.

683
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
 That's not who you are.

684
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,360
 You're going to stay in there, you're going to return to that website?

685
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
 That's not who you are.

686
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,640
 You're going to return to that drug?

687
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,360
 That's not who you are.

688
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,560
 God has something better for you.

689
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,600
 He set you apart.

690
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,720
 He's called you to know him.

691
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,480
 He's got plans for you, awesome plans for you.

692
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,080
 He wants to use you.

693
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,900
 He says, "Live good lives so that people know your good God.

694
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,680
 They know the one you serve, the way that you live, the way that you work.

695
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,920
 People are looking at you and they say, 'Man, what kingdom do you belong to?

696
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,040
 You seem so different than this world.

697
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
 You don't act like the world.

698
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,520
 You don't love the things that people of the world love.

699
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,600
 Who is your king so that you can point to him?'"

700
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,600
 Guys, I believe that God, and I want you to hear me, man.

701
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,320
 I believe that God desires to change the world through the people at this gathering.

702
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:28,240
 I believe that he wants to do incredible things through all of you, okay?

703
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,360
 But it starts with you.

704
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,460
 It starts with inside of you.

705
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,140
 You have to know who you are before you can know why he has entrusted the talents to you

706
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,500
 that he's entrusted.

707
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,100
 Before you know your purpose and your mission, you have to know who you are, who he's created

708
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,540
 you to be.

709
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,000
 In the past, whenever somebody would do something courageous, they would assume that they came

710
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 from noble blood.

711
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,220
 And so, like, if you did something, if you stopped evil, if you stood against evil, they

712
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,060
 would say of you, they'd say, "Oh, you must come from nobility.

713
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,980
 You must come from royalty.

714
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,820
 You must have royal blood inside of you.

715
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,620
 That's the only way that you would have had the courage to do that."

716
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,400
 And Jesus tonight is saying, "Hey, all of you have royal blood in you, and that is why

717
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,500
 you have the courage to do these things."

718
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,000
 And I don't know if you noticed what's going on in the world, but I can't think of a greater

719
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,820
 time for you to realize who you are and what you've been called to because there's racial

720
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:31,780
 rioting in Ferguson, Missouri over the death of a young man.

721
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,860
 This still exists today.

722
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,100
 There's still this confusion that happens.

723
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,480
 There's this Ebola virus that has broke out in Liberia.

724
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,820
 It's the most contagious virus in the history of the world.

725
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,580
 It's killing people.

726
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:52,340
 There's this group called ISIS, the Islamic State, that are killing anyone who opposes

727
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
 them.

728
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
 They're torturing them.

729
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,940
 If you call yourself a Christian, they're cutting off your head.

730
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,740
 This is happening today, 2014.

731
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,640
 There was 13 people killed and murdered in New York City this weekend, and it won't even

732
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,700
 make the headlines because of so much other craziness that's out there.

733
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,780
 And if you think church is a hobby, you look at that and you're like, "I don't know what

734
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,980
 the solution is."

735
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,780
 But if you realize that church is your identity, that you're a people who have been called

736
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,540
 apart from the world, you realize that the solution to those things is inside of you.

737
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:28,500
 "Well, JP, what are you asking me to do?

738
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,100
 Fly to Iraq, maybe?"

739
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
 I don't know.

740
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,280
 I don't know what gifts and talents the Lord has entrusted to you, but I know why he entrusted

741
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,620
 them to you.

742
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:45,660
 For him, there is something in you that cries out, "I've got to do more than this.

743
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,940
 I don't want to just settle for the mediocre American dream."

744
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,980
 And you take that American dream and you try to plug it in that void.

745
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,740
 And he's like, "No, I've called you to more.

746
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,900
 You're my people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God.

747
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,180
 I've called you out of that.

748
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,700
 I have plans for you."

749
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,980
 And the greatest tragedy I can think of right now is talent without purpose.

750
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:16,660
 And he says, "No, I have given you a purpose."

751
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,620
 You're going to watch these boundaries dispute over the Gaza Strip or any other news headline.

752
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,660
 He's like, "You might be the solution.

753
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,860
 At least the solution is inside of you.

754
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:31,700
 What are you going to do about it?"

755
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,320
 And so the application tonight, I'm trying to make this really clear.

756
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,940
 Some of you are here, you're stuck in sin, and you need to realize who you are.

757
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,020
 Like I said, you're not the life of the party anymore.

758
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,880
 You're not the easy girl anymore.

759
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,100
 You're not the drug addict anymore.

760
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,700
 You're not the porn addict anymore.

761
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,180
 You're not the kid with $100,000 in debt anymore.

762
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,420
 You're God's.

763
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,580
 And you've got to realize that.

764
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:58,420
 You've got to know that he's called you to more.

765
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
 And it may take a plan.

766
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,340
 It's going to take some accountability, certainly community.

767
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,860
 It starts with trusting in Christ for the forgiveness of sins and then living for him,

768
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:12,620
 his spirit in you, living for him, producing good works so that others would know the King.

769
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:17,420
 And then there's a second part of you that say, "No, I'm saved and I'm in and I'm going

770
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,660
 to church and I'm plugged into community group and I'm walking with God and I'm dealing with

771
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,820
 sin."

772
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,500
 And he says, "Yeah, yeah, the reason I saved you is to deal with the evil around you."

773
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,820
 And we got to lock arms and wreck shop starting here in Dallas and then spreading throughout

774
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,820
 the world.

775
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,940
 You're a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God.

776
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,860
 And so you want to do such good deeds that others say, "Well, who is the King that she

777
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,860
 serves?

778
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,240
 Who is the King that he serves?"

779
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,700
 And you say, "Well, what am I supposed to do?"

780
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,420
 And I say, "Man, get a pen and a journal and a Bible and a lot of prayer because I believe

781
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,980
 it's inside of you.

782
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:00,220
 I believe it'll tell you and it will just take some courage and some prodding.

783
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,140
 We'll partner with you."

784
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,080
 And then everyone here, and this is a layup application for you, everyone here has someone

785
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,580
 in their life that needs to be reminded of who they are.

786
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,780
 They said they knew God once, maybe you were in Bible study with them or they call themselves

787
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,180
 a Christian, but you realize that they've slipped off.

788
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,460
 They fell into some bad stuff.

789
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,700
 They got worldly.

790
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,700
 And I want you to text them.

791
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,260
 I want everyone in here to text someone and just say, "Hey, I want to remind you that

792
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,140
 you're royalty."

793
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,340
 And let that begin a conversation that you're going to have with them.

794
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,340
 They'll be saying, "What?

795
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,340
 What do you mean I'm royalty?"

796
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,340
 Or, "Why are you texting me?

797
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,340
 Are you drunk?"

798
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,100
 Or I don't know what they're going to say.

799
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,660
 But I want everyone in here, I want 3,000 text messages to go out throughout the world

800
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,780
 to someone saying, "Hey, you're royalty.

801
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,100
 Let's talk about it.

802
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:54,140
 I'm here to remind you that you're royalty."

803
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,660
 So everyone can think of someone.

804
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,780
 I'll close with this.

805
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,100
 I like movies, if you can't tell.

806
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
 I like music.

807
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,800
 I probably love movies even more.

808
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,500
 One I really like is Born Identity.

809
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,540
 I don't know if you've seen it, but there's this guy, Jason Bourne, he's a product of

810
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,020
 the government, a secret weapon.

811
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,020
 He's been trained up.

812
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,260
 He's been given all these skills.

813
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,300
 And then there's this scene when he's in this cafe, and he doesn't know who he is.

814
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,380
 Hence Born Identity.

815
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,740
 He doesn't know who he is, and he's sitting there with a friend, and he's saying, "I can't

816
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,820
 remember who I am."

817
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,820
 And she's like, "That's okay."

818
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,780
 And then he begins to say, "Hey, I know the license plates of all six cars in the parking

819
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
 lot.

820
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,860
 I know that our waitress is left-handed.

821
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,380
 I know that that guy over there is 215 pounds, and he can handle himself.

822
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,140
 I know that I can run a half a mile at this altitude before my hands start shaking."

823
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,940
 He goes, "But I don't know who I am.

824
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,680
 And so then I don't know why I can do all this, and I know all this."

825
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,660
 What a tragedy it would be if Jason Bourne took all those skills that he just said and

826
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,780
 began to use them on himself or something else.

827
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,840
 He didn't know who he was created by and why he had those gifts and talents.

828
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,980
 And some of you are here tonight, and you're like, "You know what?

829
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,700
 I can do this, and I can do this, and I can do this."

830
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,940
 But I'm here to tell you, you don't know who you are, and you're wasting those gifts and

831
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,760
 talents that God gave you for him for you, on you.

832
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,940
 You're spending them on yourself so that you can build a bigger temporary kingdom and try

833
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:37,460
 to play princess like Presley and Finley and try to play prince like Weston.

834
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,140
 "Man, you don't understand me, JP.

835
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
 I'm a lady, man."

836
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,700
 You're still playing prince.

837
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,980
 You don't realize that you are one.

838
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,780
 "Oh, you're still pretending to be a princess.

839
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,540
 I'll put on the dress and everything.

840
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,020
 I got a Pinterest album called Princess."

841
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,140
 That's not very Pinterest-ing, okay?

842
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,720
 God has something better for you.

843
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,980
 He's called you to more.

844
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,400
 The gifts and the talents that he's entrusted to you, he's given you for him.

845
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,820
 If you need help identifying what they are or how you might use them, we are here.

846
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
 We'd love to tell you.

847
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,700
 I'm just going to end by telling you what a royal is.

848
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,620
 Some of you are like, "What does it mean to be a royal?"

849
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:21,860
 It means you're an adopted child of the king of the universe, an heir of all the world

850
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,140
 and co-heirs with Christ.

851
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,660
 You are God's masterpiece created in Christ and assigned a purpose that was planned out

852
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,860
 before he created anything.

853
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,620
 You are more than a conqueror, an heir to an eternal inheritance that he has set up

854
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:42,260
 for you and sealed by his spirit, a saint who has set apart a place where God lives

855
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,420
 a light in a dark world.

856
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,460
 You're going to reign with Christ even over the angels.

857
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,180
 You will rule over the angels.

858
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,900
 You're no longer under the power of death called sin.

859
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,700
 You've been raised up with Christ and you have a seat in the heavenly places.

860
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,100
 You're immeasurably loved by God.

861
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,100
 God is your daddy.

862
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,180
 He says you can call him father.

863
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:06,940
 You are given a purpose uniquely designed without condemnation.

864
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,420
 He's no longer holding your sins against you.

865
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:16,740
 You are a new creation, a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special

866
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,140
 possession.

867
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,780
 You are.

868
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,780
 That's who you are.

869
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,340
 It's time we lived it out.

870
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,940
 If we did, everything would change.

871
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:36,340
 If just the people in the room right now understood who they were, everything would change.

872
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:42,740
 Let me pray for us that we would, and then let's worship that king.

873
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:51,020
 Father, we need your help to understand who you have created us to be.

874
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:58,180
 Father, that you had Jesus die in our place so that we might have life in this world that

875
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,820
 we do not belong to, that we would live in it as strangers and aliens.

876
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:08,780
 God, that we would deal with the sin that wages war in us, but then also that we would

877
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,260
 deal with the evil that wages war in this world.

878
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:17,460
 Father, as we sing to you, as we worship you, would you help us to identify the gifts and

879
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,380
 the talents that you've entrusted to us and help us to know what to do with them?

880
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:28,140
 Lord, protect us from ourselves that we would not waste our lives on us, but that we would

881
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,020
 spend our lives on you, the one true God.

882
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:42,060
 A few minutes convincing you from the scriptures by the Spirit of God that you're royals.

883
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,180
 And now I've got to tell you that not all of you are.

884
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,180
 That there's some of you on the outside you're looking in.

885
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,300
 There's a people that are in the room that have been set apart, and you're realizing

886
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,660
 that you're not one of them, that you've really been blending in more than you've been set

887
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:03,500
 apart, that maybe you at some point in your life have embraced the idea of God, but you

888
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,700
 haven't surrendered to him and what he's done through Christ, that he literally put all

889
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,940
 the sins that you've committed on Jesus, and he crushed him in your place because he loves

890
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:19,900
 you, and he chooses you, and he wants you playing for his team.

891
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,980
 And man, I know the world is hard.

892
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,060
 I know life is difficult, and I know it's full of distractions, and that's the hope

893
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,900
 that I give you is, man, we're all going to be together one day in paradise forever and

894
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,100
 ever and ever, and this will look like a commercial, man, like that long.

895
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,540
 Like we'll have a hard time remembering.

896
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,540
 Remember that breakup?

897
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,420
 And you'll be like, no, I don't.

898
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,380
 Like the greatest tragedy of your life, you'll be like, I don't, that happened?

899
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,380
 I don't remember.

900
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,380
 Really?

901
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,380
 Oh, maybe, no, I don't remember.

902
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,300
 I've been with God for a billion years.

903
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
 I don't remember.

904
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,300
 That's what's going to happen.

905
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,580
 That's where we're going to be, man.

906
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,140
 That's what's been set up for you.

907
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,100
 If you're here and you're realizing, man, that isn't my inheritance.

908
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,700
 That's not what I've embraced.

909
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,100
 That's not what I knew God had for me.

910
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,100
 We'd love to talk to you.

911
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,180
 There'll be a group of folks up here ready to pray with you and talk with you and wrestle

912
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,140
 with you, hard questions or wherever you're at, or just celebrate with you, man.

913
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,140
 We want to be about that here.

914
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,100
 If you've got good news, you've got a promotion, let us celebrate with you.

915
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,980
 Let us thank God with you.

916
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,480
 Amen.

917
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,980
 Amen.

918
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,480
 Amen.

919
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,980
 Amen.

920
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,480
 Amen.

921
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:19,980
 Amen.

922
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,480
 Amen.

923
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:20,980
 Amen.

924
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,480
 Amen.

925
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:21,980
 Amen.

926
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,480
 Amen.

927
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:22,980
 Amen.
