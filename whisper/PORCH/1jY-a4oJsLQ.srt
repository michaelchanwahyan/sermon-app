 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:25,160
 What's up, Porch?

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,560
 How are we doing tonight?

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,760
 Hey, it is so good to see you.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,960
 Hope that all is well.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,120
 If this is your first time ever, so glad you made it.

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,680
 Thank you for trusting us with your Tuesday night.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,720
 My name is Timothy Atteague, and I'm

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,960
 one of the teaching pastors here on Tuesday nights

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,680
 as well as Sunday mornings.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,200
 And I do want to give a shout out to all the Porch Live

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,240
 locations that are watching right now.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,560
 I want to say a special hello to Porch Live Indy, Porch Live

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,480
 Greater Lafayette, Porch Live Tulsa.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,600
 So glad that you're tuning in tonight.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,880
 I hope that all is well with you.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,120
 Here's the reality.

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,160
 If you've been at the Porch for a little bit,

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,480
 then you have heard me share often

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,560
 about my years in my days as a young adult.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,120
 And I just figure it is worth you

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,240
 having a visual of what I looked like when I was 24.

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,520
 So let me just show you a picture.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,640
 You can get just an image in your head.

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,040
 I don't know why you're laughing.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 That's super offensive.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:40,080
 So one person saw this earlier, and she

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,840
 said, if I saw you standing on the side of the road,

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,040
 I would be scared.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,840
 And that was hurtful.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
 Those shorts, I did not cut those off.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,600
 I bought them that way from Abercrombie and Fitch.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
 Thank you very much.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,520
 I was wearing those Chacos.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,640
 And I don't know what else to say about it, guys.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,360
 That just-- God did a great work in my life since then.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,680
 That's, I think, what I can say about that.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,840
 Here's what you need to know is that picture actually

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,080
 was taken at a time when I was in Europe

40
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,680
 right after the Lord wrecked my life and began rebuilding it.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,840
 So when I look at that picture, I kind of

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,920
 see past the cut off khaki shorts.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,520
 I see past the Chacos.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,440
 I see past the hair.

45
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,080
 I see past all of that.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,320
 And I see all of the goodness that God

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
 had done in my life over the past month

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
 that I had been out of the country.

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,160
 Because a month before that, my life

50
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,880
 had really crashed into rock bottom

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,760
 due to compromising decisions.

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,120
 I was living in the midst of a bunch of unnecessary pain.

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,600
 A couple of weeks ago, I told you

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,080
 that there's a difference between unavoidable pain

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
 and unnecessary pain.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
 Unavoidable pain is the pain that will find you.

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,680
 You don't have to go looking for it.

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
 It will track you down.

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
 But then there's unnecessary pain.

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 And it's what comes from compromising decisions

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
 in your life.

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,680
 I tell you that because when I look back to when I was 24,

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,760
 there's various things that I can look back and I can say,

64
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,320
 I'm so glad that I did that.

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,760
 Like, I'm so glad that I took that trip to Europe

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,800
 with friends.

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,600
 I'm so glad that I did some spontaneous road trips.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,480
 I'm so glad that I went back to A&M

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,960
 to watch some football games.

70
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,000
 Like, there's a lot of things that I did when I was 24

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,120
 that I'm glad I did.

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,480
 I'm glad that I jumped in and volunteered with Lake Highlands

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,120
 Young Life and invested in high school kids.

74
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,760
 And at the same time, there's various things

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
 that I can look back at that I did when I was 24.

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,240
 And I look back and I just think, what was I thinking?

77
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,080
 And so the reason that I bring that up is what's interesting

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,320
 is if you think about where you're at right now,

79
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,360
 whether you're 27 or 32 or you just graduated college

80
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,060
 and you just moved to Dallas, what's interesting

81
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,640
 is 10 years from now, 15 years from now, 20 years from now,

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,160
 you're going to look back onto this moment.

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,120
 You're going to look back on who you were at 2023

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 and you're going to have a picture of yourself

85
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
 and you're going to see it.

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,880
 And it's going to jog your memory about the life

87
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
 you were living right now.

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,580
 And there's going to be things that you're going to look back

89
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,800
 and you're going to think, I'm so glad I did that.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,500
 And then there's going to be other things

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,360
 that you're actually doing right now in your life.

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,080
 10 years from now, 15 years from now,

93
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,000
 you're going to look back on this time, this season,

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,040
 and you're going to say, what was I thinking?

95
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
 Isn't that crazy to think about?

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,680
 You're going to think, what was I thinking?

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,400
 Why did I date him?

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
 Why did I date her?

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,960
 Why did I go there?

100
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,640
 That was such a terrible idea.

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,680
 What was I thinking?

102
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,160
 And so there's been various times in my life

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,280
 where people have asked me, hey, if you could go back

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,080
 and talk to your younger self, what

105
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,720
 would you tell your younger self?

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,400
 And so that's what I want to do tonight.

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
 I want to share with you five things

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,040
 that I would share with my young adult self.

109
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,240
 Like if I could go back and talk to 24-year-old Timothy

110
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
 Attiq, there's five things that I would share with him.

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
 And what's interesting is the five things

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
 that I'm going to share aren't my own.

113
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,240
 Like this is not my own material.

114
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,760
 They just come straight out of the end

115
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,240
 of the book of Ecclesiastes.

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,440
 They actually come from King Solomon.

117
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,820
 If you're new to the porch, we've

118
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,640
 been in a series walking through the book of Ecclesiastes.

119
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,720
 You might not be familiar with Ecclesiastes,

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 but it's considered wisdom literature,

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,800
 which means it can show you how to live a wise life.

122
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
 It was written by one of the wisest people

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,160
 to ever walk on the face of the earth.

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,600
 It is highly applicable to the lives of young adults.

125
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,960
 In fact, right there at the end of the book,

126
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,840
 you know what it is?

127
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,480
 Is it is King Solomon who is old in life,

128
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,640
 and he's basically giving his swan song

129
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,960
 to the next generation.

130
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,040
 He is speaking into the lives of young adults.

131
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,200
 And what we're going to see King Solomon say

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,120
 to the next generation, and what ends up

133
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,760
 being the five things that I would say to my young adult

134
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,180
 self are the things that I want to share with you tonight.

135
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,080
 The five things that we're going to see from King Solomon

136
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,580
 is this.

137
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,160
 I'll share them with you now, and then

138
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,000
 we'll begin to walk through it.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,440
 First, before you follow your heart,

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,720
 you need a new and cultivated heart.

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,920
 Number two, embrace where God has you.

142
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,560
 Number three, today is the best day

143
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,680
 to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.

144
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,920
 Number four, your view of God determines your response to God.

145
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,380
 And number five, never get over the gospel.

146
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,080
 That's what we're going to unpack tonight.

147
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
 If I could go back and talk to my 24-year-old self,

148
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,200
 that's what I would tell him.

149
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,100
 And that's what I hope you hear tonight.

150
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,640
 So if you have a Bible, turn with me

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,320
 to Ecclesiastes chapter 11.

152
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,920
 We're going to start in 11, and then we're

153
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,520
 going to go through the end of the book,

154
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,720
 and we're going to finish our series tonight.

155
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,920
 [AUDIO OUT]

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,360
 Ecclesiastes chapter 11 is where we're

157
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,440
 going to find our first truth, which

158
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,600
 is before you follow your heart, you

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,880
 need a new and cultivated heart.

160
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,920
 So from King Solomon talking to the next generation,

161
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,760
 that is what he wants you to know.

162
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,800
 Look at what he says in verse 9.

163
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,080
 He says, "Rejoice, O young man, in your youth."

164
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,200
 Rejoice, O young man, in your youth,

165
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,720
 and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth.

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,880
 Do you see what he's saying?

167
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,280
 He's saying, look, your young adult years,

168
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,600
 they are great years.

169
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,320
 Like, enjoy them.

170
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,480
 Make the most of the years that you have right now.

171
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,120
 Like, don't let these years slip by.

172
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
 That's what he's saying when he says, let your heart cheer you

173
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
 in the days of your youth.

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,280
 And then he goes on, and watch what he says.

175
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,240
 He says, "Walk in the ways of your heart."

176
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,240
 We might say in our day, follow your heart.

177
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
 Walk in the ways of your heart in the sight of your eyes,

178
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
 but know that for all these things,

179
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
 God will bring you into judgment.

180
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,800
 So this is very interesting, because what Solomon is doing

181
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,680
 is he's like putting bumpers on the bowling alley lane.

182
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,440
 He's like, look, there's room for you to take--

183
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,320
 there's a fairway, and there are bumpers

184
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 that will keep you on track.

185
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
 The reason I say that is he says, follow your heart,

186
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,800
 but just remember that God will bring you into judgment.

187
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,240
 So when Solomon says, follow your heart, and when he says,

188
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,600
 walk in the sight of your eyes, here's what he's getting at.

189
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,800
 He's saying, look, you have more freedom right now

190
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,880
 than you will ever have in your life.

191
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,600
 And I know some of you guys are crushing 60 hours a week,

192
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
 but here's what I'm really saying.

193
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,760
 What I'm saying is you will only gain more responsibility

194
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,600
 the older you get.

195
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
 Like if you get married, you're going to have a wife.

196
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,160
 If you have kids, you're going to have a husband or wife

197
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,480
 and kids, and you might work your way up in your job.

198
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,360
 I was talking to one guy in his 60s recently,

199
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,320
 and he was like, I had worked myself to a place

200
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,440
 where I had five kids at home and 20 kids at work.

201
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,600
 What was he saying?

202
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,040
 He was like, my life was full of responsibility.

203
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
 But right now, in your young adult years,

204
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,440
 this is the most free you'll ever be.

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,880
 So what Solomon is saying is even though you are still busy,

206
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,160
 responsibility is only going to increase.

207
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,800
 So don't waste this time.

208
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,120
 Don't miss it, because you're full of passion.

209
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,680
 The heart is like the control center of your being.

210
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,520
 It speaks to your thoughts and your desires,

211
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,440
 your motivations, your dreams.

212
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,280
 And so what Solomon is saying is, hey, you've got dreams.

213
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
 You've got ambitions.

214
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,320
 You've got desires.

215
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,120
 And you should pursue those.

216
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,040
 Don't wait till some someday when

217
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,840
 it feels like all the stars align for you

218
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,440
 to finally follow your passions and follow your ambitions.

219
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,280
 He's saying, do it now.

220
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,680
 When he says, walk in the sight of your eyes,

221
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,840
 your eyes are the way that you perceive opportunity.

222
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,200
 So Solomon is saying, look, if you're beholding opportunity,

223
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,400
 step into it.

224
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
 Let's go.

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,480
 Don't wait around.

226
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,120
 Don't wait for someday.

227
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,560
 Today is the day.

228
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,080
 Get moving.

229
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,160
 Do it.

230
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,400
 And at the same time, he puts bumpers on it.

231
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,360
 And he says, just remember, though, for all of these

232
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,680
 things, remember, God will bring you into judgment.

233
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,960
 What's he saying there?

234
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,360
 He's saying, look, follow your passions.

235
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
 But just remember, God cares about your passions.

236
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,520
 Follow your dreams.

237
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,680
 But remember, God cares about your dreams

238
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
 and your opportunities.

239
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,520
 Not every passion or dream or opportunity is worth following.

240
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,960
 God cares about how you live now.

241
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,360
 So that's why the point is, before you follow your heart,

242
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,240
 you need a new and cultivated heart.

243
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,120
 What I'm really saying is, before you follow your dreams,

244
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,400
 you just need to make sure that they're godly dreams.

245
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
 And before you follow your desires,

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,800
 you just need to make sure that they're godly desires.

247
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,160
 We live in a day and time where we love the idea of just doing

248
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,320
 what feels right.

249
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,480
 But let's just be clear.

250
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,040
 Sometimes really bad things are going to feel really good.

251
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,080
 Like things that lead to really major brokenness in your life

252
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,160
 can feel really good at different points.

253
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
 So it's just good to have an understanding of our hearts.

254
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,680
 We talked about this a couple of weeks ago.

255
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,000
 Jeremiah 17 9 says, "The heart is deceitful above all things

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,160
 and desperately sick."

257
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,960
 Who can understand it?

258
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,640
 The heart is described as deceitful.

259
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,400
 Like your heart, apart from Jesus, it will deceive you.

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,560
 And it will lead you to do dumb things.

261
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,200
 But the good news of the gospel is

262
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,800
 that we are promised a new heart in Jesus.

263
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,000
 That's why I say, before you follow your heart,

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,520
 you need a new heart.

265
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,760
 Ezekiel 36 26 says, "And I will give you

266
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,920
 a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you.

267
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,400
 And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh

268
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,160
 and give you a heart of flesh."

269
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,360
 So when you come to know Jesus Christ,

270
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
 you're not a bad person that becomes good.

271
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,520
 You're a dead person that becomes new.

272
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,480
 And part of that is that you're given a new heart, which

273
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,240
 has new desires.

274
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,760
 And so your dreams become more in line

275
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
 with God's dreams for you.

276
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,840
 Your desires become more in line with God's desires for you.

277
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,400
 But before you follow your heart,

278
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,520
 you don't just need a new heart.

279
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,140
 You need a cultivated heart.

280
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,120
 Here's what I mean.

281
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,000
 God might put a new heart within you,

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,720
 but that heart needs to be cultivated.

283
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,120
 Like, you're not just going to magically trust in Jesus

284
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,760
 and then everything always in your life is just about Jesus.

285
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,960
 Like, you wake up every morning and all you want to do

286
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
 is be where Jesus is.

287
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,440
 And all you want to do is what Jesus wants you to do.

288
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,160
 No, there's still a battle inside of you.

289
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,160
 So that heart has to be cultivated by Jesus.

290
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,400
 So what does that look like?

291
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,320
 Well, let me explain it this way.

292
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,240
 I'm a big Dallas Cowboys football fan.

293
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,080
 Like, I don't know if there's any Cowboys fans.

294
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,160
 I don't know what your team is.

295
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,720
 Whoever your team is, you can just apply it to your situation.

296
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,640
 But I want you-- here's what I want you to think about.

297
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,200
 I want you to think about this.

298
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,160
 What if the Cowboys are on offense

299
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,640
 and they got into the huddle and Dak Prescott was like,

300
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,240
 here's what I'm thinking, guys.

301
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,360
 Everybody just follow your heart.

302
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,840
 Like, that's what I'm going to do?

303
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,360
 I'm going to follow my heart?

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,920
 Pollard, what are you thinking?

305
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
 You're going to follow your heart behind me?

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,840
 Great.

307
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,520
 C.D. Lamb, what are you thinking?

308
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,000
 You're going to go out and follow your heart?

309
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
 Whatever you want to do.

310
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,760
 Offensive line, what are you thinking?

311
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,720
 Don't tell me.

312
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,640
 Follow your heart.

313
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,720
 We'll just see what happens.

314
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,680
 Can you imagine how chaotic that would be?

315
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,240
 It would be crazy if Dak was like,

316
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,400
 I'm going to follow my heart.

317
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,240
 Everyone, you just do whatever you want to do,

318
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,600
 and it's going to be great.

319
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,640
 It won't be great because you actually

320
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,600
 have an opposing team that has been watching film

321
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,320
 on how to take you down.

322
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,400
 And the same is true in the spiritual realm.

323
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,160
 We have an enemy who is seeking to take us down.

324
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,760
 And so when we just do whatever we want to do,

325
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,480
 a lot of times it doesn't go well.

326
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,840
 What do you see Dak Prescott doing in between each play?

327
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,640
 If you watch him, you're going to see him

328
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,680
 covering up his ears.

329
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,880
 Why?

330
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
 Because there's comms in his helmet

331
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,200
 and his coach is calling the play.

332
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,440
 If the comms not working, he's going to look to the sideline

333
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,320
 to get the play.

334
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,040
 Do you know what it looks like to cultivate your heart?

335
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,760
 To cultivate your heart is to consistently look

336
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,000
 to the sideline.

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,960
 You look to the coach to call the play.

338
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,040
 God is the coach.

339
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,880
 He is the one who is after our joy.

340
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,520
 He wants us to walk in fullness of joy.

341
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,160
 But that fullness of joy comes from our desires, our dreams,

342
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,080
 our motivations being driven by him.

343
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 So when Solomon says, get going, walk

344
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,760
 in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes,

345
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,800
 what he's saying is, hey, when your heart and your sight

346
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
 are aligned with God, something amazing

347
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,200
 can happen in your young adult years.

348
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,560
 But what does it look like to look to the sidelines?

349
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,720
 Well, number one, you've got to come to Jesus.

350
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,800
 Like if you don't know Jesus, if you're here tonight

351
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,600
 and you're not a Christian, like you're just

352
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
 checking this thing out, you thought it was a restaurant

353
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,560
 and it's actually a church, you got tricked.

354
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,520
 But you're still-- you're here.

355
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,960
 So you might as well explore it.

356
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,880
 Come to Jesus.

357
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,160
 Put your trust in him.

358
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,520
 But don't just come to Jesus.

359
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,760
 Live surrendered to Jesus.

360
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,440
 Don't just make Jesus your savior.

361
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,360
 Let him be your king.

362
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,400
 Let him reign in your life.

363
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,880
 And then submit to his word.

364
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,120
 You can't know God's ways without knowing his word.

365
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,440
 Don't just know what other people say.

366
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,840
 Know what God says.

367
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,600
 He's the coach.

368
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,040
 He calls the plays.

369
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,480
 And then walk with others.

370
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,280
 Invite other Jesus followers into your life

371
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,120
 who can help you identify, hey, I

372
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,080
 don't think that that desire is in line with God's desires.

373
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,120
 Don't follow your heart in this situation

374
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
 because it's going to mislead you.

375
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,000
 So if I were to talk to my young adult self,

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,080
 here's what I would tell them.

377
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,040
 I would just say, before you follow your heart,

378
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,920
 you need a new and cultivated heart.

379
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,000
 The second thing that I would tell them

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 is I would just say, embrace where God has you.

381
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,280
 Embrace it.

382
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,600
 When I say embrace, I am saying hug the place

383
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,440
 where God has you now.

384
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,000
 Look at what Solomon says in verse 10.

385
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,760
 He says, "Remove vexation from your heart.

386
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
 Put away pain from your body for your youth.

387
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,720
 In the dawn of life are vanity."

388
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,520
 I want to break down what he's saying here.

389
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,800
 When he says the dawn of life, that

390
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,320
 can be translated the prime of life.

391
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,800
 You are in the prime of life right now.

392
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,240
 Congratulations.

393
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,200
 You made it.

394
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,040
 You're there.

395
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,560
 You are officially in the prime of life.

396
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,120
 That word dawn, it literally means black or blackened.

397
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,240
 It's talking about the hair.

398
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,080
 Like you're in the stage of life where there is no gray hair

399
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
 yet.

400
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,920
 What's that like?

401
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,280
 It's been a minute since I was there.

402
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,400
 But he's saying, look, the dawn of life, youth

403
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
 and the dawn of life, they're vanity.

404
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,960
 That word vanity, it's the word that's

405
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
 used most in the book of Ecclesiastes.

406
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,160
 It's the Hebrew word hevel.

407
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,280
 It literally means mist or vapor.

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,560
 So it's like that steam that comes out

409
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,960
 of your mouth on a cold day.

410
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
 It's like trying to catch that.

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
 It's impossible.

412
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,880
 It's so fleeting.

413
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,960
 So Solomon's point is your youthfulness, the prime of life,

414
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,360
 it is so fleeting.

415
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,120
 It will flash by.

416
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,560
 What's crazy is this is how young adulthood goes.

417
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,480
 You graduate from college.

418
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,080
 And for the first 10 years after you graduate college,

419
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,280
 you feel like you just graduated college.

420
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,200
 But think about this.

421
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,120
 If you're 25, you were a freshman in college

422
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,840
 seven years ago.

423
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,000
 Seven years ago.

424
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,960
 If you're 30, you were a freshman in college 12 years

425
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,920
 ago.

426
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,800
 That's how fast time moves.

427
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,760
 It flies by.

428
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,120
 And so Solomon's point is, hey, the prime of life goes fast.

429
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,440
 So don't spend all of your time missing out on joy

430
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
 during the season.

431
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,520
 Instead, what does he say?

432
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,560
 He says remove vexation.

433
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,080
 Do you know what vexation is?

434
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,600
 It's referring to unnecessary emotional anxiety

435
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,240
 and frustration.

436
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,800
 Saying don't spend all of the prime of your life frustrated.

437
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,480
 And yet I feel like so many young adults

438
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,480
 spend all of their young adult years frustrated waiting

439
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
 for the next season of life to come.

440
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,040
 Like they will truly be satisfied and happy

441
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,040
 in the next chapter, but not in this chapter.

442
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,800
 And that was me.

443
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,240
 That 24-year-old you saw in that picture,

444
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,120
 I hated being single.

445
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
 Hated it.

446
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,400
 I actually had a friend, my best friend,

447
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
 here's what he told me.

448
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,400
 He said you are just happier when you're in a relationship.

449
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,960
 Why?

450
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,800
 Because I needed that.

451
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 I needed a girl in my life to feel valuable,

452
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,960
 to feel that companionship, to have those plans,

453
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,360
 to feel wanted.

454
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,120
 I needed that to feel satisfied.

455
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,000
 And so in all of the days that I was single,

456
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,360
 I was frustrated.

457
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,520
 And I wonder if that's you.

458
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,320
 I wonder if you're just frustrated.

459
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,080
 You look around at other people and you're frustrated.

460
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,600
 Maybe it's not about a relationship.

461
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,400
 Maybe you're just frustrated that you're not in the job

462
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,680
 that you want to be.

463
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,040
 Like I know a lot of young adults, they graduate college,

464
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,120
 they get their first job, they're really excited about it,

465
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,760
 they're finally making their own money,

466
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,600
 and then you get into the job and you're like, wait a second,

467
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,280
 there is no more summer break.

468
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,000
 Like spring break isn't a thing.

469
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,240
 Like this is just, this is your life now.

470
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,120
 And you're like this job, like there is so many layers

471
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,880
 of management above me and this feels

472
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,480
 like it's not fully maximizing who I am as a person.

473
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,400
 And so you get three months in and you're like, oh my gosh,

474
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,160
 I only have nine more months until my apartment lease is up.

475
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,520
 Because you're just ready to move on to the next thing.

476
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,600
 You're frustrated.

477
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,880
 Let me just encourage you, don't spend all

478
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,400
 of your young adult years longing for the next thing.

479
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,440
 Embrace where God has you now.

480
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,560
 And let me just tell you, the best way to experience more joy

481
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,000
 with where God has you now, stop looking around

482
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,280
 and comparing yourself to other people.

483
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,400
 Stop comparing.

484
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,720
 Stop comparing how much money you have

485
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,280
 versus how much they have.

486
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,680
 Stop being frustrated that they have the Tesla and you don't.

487
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,600
 Stop being frustrated that they take the extravagant vacations

488
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,320
 to Europe and you don't.

489
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,640
 Stop getting frustrated that they get to go out to eat and go

490
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,560
 to happy hour and buy drinks more than you get to.

491
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,960
 Embrace where God has you.

492
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,520
 It is what it is.

493
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,400
 And God has good plans for you now.

494
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,160
 He wants to do something in your life now.

495
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
 And so don't miss it.

496
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,560
 Now here's what I'm not saying.

497
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,120
 It's OK if you're single and you want to be married.

498
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
 That's a good desire.

499
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,200
 You don't need to do this thing where you're like,

500
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,800
 OK God, I don't want anyone.

501
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:58,640
 I mean, he looks amazing, but I don't even want him.

502
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,160
 No.

503
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,840
 Like you don't need to-- let's not be fake.

504
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,920
 It's OK to acknowledge he would be nice.

505
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,280
 She sounds great.

506
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,280
 But like I'm not going to bank on a relationship.

507
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 I'm not going to bet all of my joy on a relationship.

508
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,400
 Find your joy in Jesus and where he has you right now.

509
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,920
 Number three.

510
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,400
 Today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.

511
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,200
 If I could talk to 24-year-old TA, that's what I would tell him.

512
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,160
 I would say, today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.

513
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,720
 And you might be like, I know your story.

514
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,280
 Weren't you in seminary at the time?

515
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,800
 Yeah.

516
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,040
 And you know what happened to me?

517
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,640
 I let serving Jesus replace knowing Jesus.

518
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,000
 And so what I would tell him is I would say, today is the best day to

519
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,880
 wholeheartedly follow Jesus and know Jesus.

520
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,360
 Watch this.

521
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
 This is chapter 12.

522
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,800
 Chapter 12 is masterful.

523
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,000
 OK.

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,680
 Watch what Solomon says.

525
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,320
 Verse 1, he says, "Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before

526
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,400
 the evil days come and the years draw near, of which you will say, 'I have no

527
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,840
 pleasure in them.'" So what's he saying?

528
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,560
 He's saying right now, while you're still young in your young adult years, like

529
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,240
 remember your Creator now before you get old.

530
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,800
 Because when you're old, it's not nearly as enjoyable.

531
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,600
 Life is not nearly as enjoyable as it is now.

532
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,120
 And what's interesting is he refers to God as Creator.

533
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,640
 Why?

534
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,080
 Because he's trying to transport us all the way back to the beginning of the

535
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,720
 Bible at creation, where everything was perfect.

536
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,840
 And Adam and Eve had a perfect relationship with God, where they saw

537
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,800
 God face to face, and they enjoyed his presence.

538
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,040
 And yet what happened is they rebelled against God.

539
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,560
 And because they rebelled against God, they were removed from the presence of

540
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,240
 God.

541
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,880
 They could no longer walk by sight.

542
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,240
 They had to walk by faith.

543
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,080
 And so sin had broken into the picture and fractured our relationship with God.

544
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,280
 And yet what Jesus has done is he has come.

545
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,360
 And what he's done is he's come to repair that broken relationship that each one of

546
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,800
 us has with God.

547
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,600
 And he's come so that we could begin to taste what life was like with God in the

548
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,120
 garden.

549
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,840
 That's why he says, "Remember also your Creator."

550
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,080
 Because he's saying, "Look, I want you to taste what Adam and Eve experienced at

551
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,000
 creation."

552
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,320
 You can experience nearness with God.

553
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,920
 You can experience his presence.

554
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,400
 You can experience intimacy and joy just being with him.

555
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,600
 So when he says, "Remember your Creator," what he's not saying is, "Hey,

556
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,200
 every Tuesday night, check in with God."

557
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,840
 No, what he's saying is, "Walk with him now.

558
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,960
 Passionately pursue him now.

559
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,160
 Enjoy him wholeheartedly now.

560
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,840
 Do it now before the evil days and years draw near of which you will say,

561
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
 'I have no pleasure in them.'"

562
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,160
 What he's talking about is he's talking about getting old.

563
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:19,240
 And then in verses 2 through 7, Solomon shares this poem about getting old.

564
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,640
 And it's one long run-on sentence, and the idea is that if you were to just read

565
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,120
 this thing straight through, you would be out of breath.

566
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,640
 And the idea is that it's like as your breath runs out, it's like the clock runs

567
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,280
 out on your life.

568
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,360
 So just watch what he says.

569
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,000
 He says, "Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars are darkened

570
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,600
 and the clouds return after the rain."

571
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,680
 You know what he's saying?

572
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,600
 He's saying like, "The older you get, the darker your days get."

573
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,040
 And like one storm is going to hit your life, and just as that storm is passing,

574
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,880
 there's new clouds already coming in.

575
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,240
 Like the older you get, you get to a point where it's just like one health issue

576
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,680
 after the next, and you're going to doctors that you can't even pronounce the

577
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,120
 name of their ologist.

578
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,400
 You know, like it's too hard to say.

579
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,000
 And you're going to specialists after specialists, and you're going to way more

580
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,480
 funerals than you're going to weddings.

581
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,480
 You're burying more and more friends.

582
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,200
 He's like, "Don't wait till that day to start walking with God."

583
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,080
 Then he goes on, verse 3, "In the day when the keepers of the house tremble."

584
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,520
 He's talking about your arms and your hands.

585
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,760
 Like a day is coming where your arms and hands, they're going to shake,

586
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,000
 and you don't want them to shake.

587
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,640
 Like my aunt is 92, and she jokes because she's got a tremor in her hand,

588
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,040
 and she's like, "I can't hold a hamburger because by the time it got to my mouth,

589
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,880
 all of the fixings will be gone."

590
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,560
 But it's a tremor that she didn't ask for, but that's just a part of her being 92.

591
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,920
 "In the days when the keepers of the house tremble, in the strong men are bent."

592
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,120
 That's talking about your legs, the older you get, your legs get bent,

593
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,440
 and you begin to walk hunched over.

594
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,280
 "In the grinders," those are your teeth, "your grinders cease because they are few."

595
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,840
 He's saying your teeth fall out.

596
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:29,640
 "In those who look through the windows are dimmed, your eyesight begins to fade."

597
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
 It goes bad.

598
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,680
 Don't wait till then to finally start walking with Jesus.

599
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,080
 Verse 4, "In the doors on the street are shut when the sound of the grinding is loud."

600
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,160
 That's talking about your ears, that you become more and more hard of hearing.

601
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,200
 And watch this, "And one rises up at the sound of a bird."

602
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 It's like that bird chirps once, and you're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's happening?

603
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
 What's happening?"

604
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,280
 Like my 92-year-old aunt, I was staying with her last month, or at the beginning of this

605
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
 month.

606
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
 You know what she said?

607
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:07,400
 She said, "I have 3.30 in the morning," because she can't sleep past 3.30.

608
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,680
 That's just her reality.

609
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,080
 She doesn't set an alarm.

610
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,920
 That is just, when you get, the older you get, the harder it is to sleep.

611
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,840
 "All the daughters of song are brought low."

612
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,800
 That's talking about the vocal cords that no longer have the elastic strength.

613
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,520
 Verse 5, "They are afraid also of what is high."

614
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,100
 It's like, that's too high.

615
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
 Can you reach that for me?

616
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,240
 I'm kind of scared of what could happen.

617
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,280
 Like what I will pull, just trying to reach for it.

618
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,560
 And terrors are in the way.

619
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,680
 The almond tree blossoms.

620
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:48,120
 Almond trees, almond trees are pale in the springtime.

621
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,960
 This is talking about someone's hair which has turned white with age.

622
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,360
 The grasshopper drags itself along.

623
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
 What an image.

624
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,320
 There's just, there's no spring in your step anymore.

625
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:08,380
 It's like, just to walk is kind of a miserable process.

626
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,120
 And then he goes on, he's like, "And desire fails."

627
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,560
 Which is so interesting that Solomon, the guy with hundreds of wives and concubines,

628
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:27,380
 is like, "Even in the old age, the thing that I couldn't get enough of has finally dissipated.

629
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,200
 Like even my sexual desire is gone."

630
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,120
 He's saying as an old man.

631
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,240
 He says, "Because man is going to his eternal home and the mourners go about the streets."

632
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,880
 Verse 6 says, "Before the silver cord is snapped."

633
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,400
 He's describing here a well from which you draw water.

634
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,900
 He's saying, "Before the silver cord is snapped or the golden bowl is broken or the pitcher

635
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,080
 is shattered at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern."

636
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
 What's his point?

637
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,120
 All of these things work together to draw up life-giving water.

638
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,560
 And he's like, "The things that hold life-giving water are broken."

639
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,520
 It's like your body, you reach a point in life where your body is no longer capable

640
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,560
 of holding life and you die.

641
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:21,600
 And so he says in verse 7, "And the dust returns to the earth as it was.

642
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,400
 And the spirit returns to God who gave it."

643
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,880
 In verse 8, this is the refrain that he started the book with.

644
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,160
 He says, "Vanity of vanity," says the preacher, "it is all, all is vanity."

645
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,320
 He's just saying, "Look, your life is so fleeting.

646
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,100
 I know you're in a stage of life where you feel like you're going to live forever and

647
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,680
 you're always going to have your strength and you're always going to be able to run

648
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,080
 a marathon and you're always going to be able to do whatever you want to do whenever you

649
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
 want to do it.

650
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:00,440
 And that day is going to be so painful if you wait until that day where you can't function

651
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,240
 like you want to function and you wait until that day to finally find Jesus."

652
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,160
 He's saying, "Don't waste your youth.

653
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,800
 There's never been a better time to walk with God.

654
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,680
 Walk with God now when you still have strength in your hands to serve people.

655
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,640
 Walk with God now while your legs still work well and you can go and you can be a messenger

656
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,640
 to the roughly three billion people in the world that have never heard the name of Jesus.

657
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,560
 Know Jesus now while you can still behold beautiful things.

658
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:40,560
 You can behold creation and your heart can well up with joy just beholding all that God

659
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,480
 has created.

660
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,040
 Like while your vocal cords are still strong, worship Jesus now when you can sing at the

661
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,920
 top of your lungs."

662
00:33:51,920 --> 00:34:00,360
 Today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus.

663
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,240
 And I just want to be clear with you.

664
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:09,800
 I just want to speak to you to make sure you know this is why you exist.

665
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,400
 You exist to know Jesus and to make him known.

666
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,080
 That's what the point and purpose of your life is.

667
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,680
 It all boils down to that.

668
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,480
 That's why Paul says in Colossians 116, he says, "For by him," talking about Jesus, "all

669
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,720
 things were created," which is interesting because Solomon in the Old Testament says,

670
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
 "Remember your creator."

671
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,880
 Well, Paul says, "Well, do you know who was involved in creation?

672
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
 Jesus."

673
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:39,160
 He says, "For by Jesus, all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,

674
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,440
 whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through

675
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
 Jesus."

676
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,480
 And watch this, "All things were created for Jesus."

677
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,840
 You were created for Jesus.

678
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,320
 The reason you exist is to know Jesus.

679
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,000
 I'll explain it this way.

680
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
 Some of you all might have heard this before.

681
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,420
 I always have my iPhone with me on stage.

682
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,980
 Why does the iPhone exist?

683
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,240
 The iPhone exists to put the world at your fingertips.

684
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,720
 You can see someone face to face and you can have a conversation with anyone in the world

685
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,640
 without actually being in person.

686
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,040
 You can get a date without leaving your house.

687
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,960
 Just one swipe could change your life.

688
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,280
 The iPhone exists to put the world at your fingertips.

689
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,520
 You can live like the iPhone exists for a different purpose, right?

690
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,960
 Like if the table's wobbly, you could jam your iPhone under there and be like, "Man,

691
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
 that works really well."

692
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,080
 Or you can flip it over on your coffee table and you're like, "Man, this is a great coaster.

693
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,920
 I don't know if you've ever tried this, but it just works well as a coaster."

694
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,880
 You can use the iPhone for a different purpose, but it doesn't change the fact that the iPhone

695
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,560
 is most fully fulfilling the purpose for which it's been created when it is putting the world

696
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,720
 at your fingertips.

697
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,560
 And the same is true for you.

698
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,880
 You have been made to know Jesus.

699
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,880
 That is why you exist.

700
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,680
 And you can live as if you exist for a different purpose.

701
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,200
 You can live as if you exist to be a millionaire by 30.

702
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,100
 You can live as if you exist to get a ring on your finger.

703
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:28,360
 You can live as if you exist to be the top person in your company or to run your own

704
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
 thing.

705
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,960
 You can live as if you exist to complete an Ironman triathlon.

706
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,360
 You can live like that's why you exist, but it doesn't change the fact that you will be

707
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,480
 most fully alive and most fully functioning when you fulfill the purpose for which you've

708
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:53,180
 been created, which is to know Jesus Christ intimately.

709
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
 And so I'll just say this.

710
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,280
 Do you want to know where regret is found?

711
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:06,280
 Regret is found in getting to 40 and still sitting in spiritual diapers because you've

712
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,740
 just never taken the time to grow up in your faith.

713
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,880
 Because you want to run to everything else because you think that there's more life,

714
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,480
 more joy, more satisfaction out there than there is with Jesus.

715
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,720
 And so if I could tell 24-year-old Timothy Atteke something, I would just say, "Look,

716
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:29,000
 today is the best day to wholeheartedly follow Jesus."

717
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,400
 The fourth thing that I would tell my younger self is this, is I would just say, "Look,

718
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,500
 a good truth to live by is this.

719
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,720
 Your view of God determines your response to God."

720
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,340
 Hopefully you've heard me say that multiple times before, but I say that because Solomon

721
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,280
 brings it up.

722
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
 Your view of God determines your response to God.

723
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,600
 That is the greatest single truth that I learned in my late 20s as a young adult.

724
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:02,480
 I learned it right around the age of 29, and I wish that at 29 I could have gone back to

725
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,920
 my 24-year-old self and just said, "Look, your view of God will determine your response

726
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,120
 to God, and that truth will change everything."

727
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,720
 Solomon says right at the end of the book, skip down to verse 13, what does he say?

728
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,960
 He says, "The end of the matter, all has been heard."

729
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
 Do you know what he's saying?

730
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,560
 He's saying, "Look, this is what it all boils down to."

731
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:31,520
 Solomon, the wisest guy in the world, the wealthiest guy in the world, the guy who had

732
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,920
 probably had more sex than anyone else in the world, he says, "Look, here's the end

733
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,040
 of the matter.

734
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,560
 Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man."

735
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,880
 This is what life comes down to.

736
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,720
 It comes down to fearing God and keeping His commandments.

737
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,280
 He says, "Fear God and keep His commandments."

738
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,880
 Fear God talks about your view of God.

739
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,660
 What he's saying is live with a right view of God.

740
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,120
 He says, "Keep His commandments."

741
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:07,440
 He's talking about your response to God, have the right response to God.

742
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,840
 What I want you to learn at whatever age you're at right now is that the two go hand in hand.

743
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,980
 Your view of God will actually determine your response to God.

744
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,220
 If you have a big view of God, you're going to have a big response to God.

745
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,200
 If you're sitting there right now and you feel like you're having a small response to

746
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,160
 God, you wake up in the morning, you don't want to spend time with God, you feel too

747
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,920
 busy for God, when you show up here you're not interested in worshiping Him, you know

748
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,120
 what the problem is?

749
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,520
 You're having a small response because you have a small view.

750
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,440
 This is how all relationships work.

751
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,920
 When you find a guy who's head over heels about a girl, like he'll watch any Nicholas

752
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,000
 Sparks movie with her and he's like, "It's got a good plot."

753
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 "No, it doesn't."

754
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,440
 Like, you know what's happened there?

755
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,920
 He's got such a big view of the girl that he has a big response to her.

756
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:05,000
 But what happens when that view of a person changes?

757
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,680
 You stop texting, you start ghosting.

758
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,920
 Why?

759
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,920
 Your view determines your response.

760
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:22,160
 You know what, for so much of my young adult life, I lived under the banner of this is

761
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,280
 what I should do spiritually.

762
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,160
 I should read my Bible.

763
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,920
 I should go to church.

764
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,360
 I should pray.

765
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,600
 Do you know why it was a bunch of shoulds?

766
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,720
 Do you want to know why it was a bunch of discipline?

767
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,200
 Not much delight.

768
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,240
 Because I was operating, I was trying to have a big response with a small view.

769
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,800
 And everything changed.

770
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:00,440
 When I began to fight for the biggest view of God possible, it changed my response.

771
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,760
 Solomon says, "Fear God, keep His commandments."

772
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
 That's what it all boils down to.

773
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,360
 So my encouragement for you is fight for the biggest view of God possible every day.

774
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,560
 And just watch what happens to your response.

775
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,400
 And then the final thing that I would tell myself, my 24-year-old self, is this, never

776
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,040
 get over the gospel.

777
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,760
 Never get over the good news of Jesus Christ.

778
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,720
 Look at what verse 14 says.

779
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,720
 Solomon ends the whole book by saying, "For God will bring every deed into judgment with

780
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,160
 every secret thing, whether good or evil."

781
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,960
 And then the book ends, that's it.

782
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,640
 He ends by saying, "God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether

783
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,680
 good or evil."

784
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,360
 What a bad note to end on.

785
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,040
 It's so unsettling.

786
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,560
 Someday you're going to stand before God and everything you've ever thought, everything

787
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,000
 you've ever said, everything you've ever done is going to be revealed by God.

788
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,980
 The reason I would tell my younger self, never get over the gospel, is because if you know

789
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:14,160
 Jesus Christ, then you don't have to fear that day that you stand before God.

790
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,600
 Why?

791
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,640
 Because when you know Jesus Christ, when you understand what He's done for you on the cross,

792
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:25,160
 that His body was broken and His blood was shed on the cross to make payment for all

793
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,000
 of your sins, all of your imperfections, and when He rose from the dead, it was a demonstration

794
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,760
 that He had taken care of all of your failures.

795
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,660
 When you know Jesus Christ in a personal way, do you know what happens is all of your failures

796
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,920
 are cleansed.

797
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,220
 They are dealt with by Jesus.

798
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,740
 So when you stand before God, the blood of Christ has washed you clean.

799
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,540
 But not just that.

800
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:00,300
 Like today, the reason I say never get over the gospel is because today, because of what

801
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:05,940
 Christ has done, and because of faith in Him, He's actually put His Spirit inside of you

802
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,020
 so that you can live a life pleasing to God.

803
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,180
 And so when you stand before God, there's going to be plenty of things that are revealed

804
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,460
 that just shows how amazing and powerful the Spirit of God was working through you to make

805
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,300
 you more like Jesus.

806
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:33,220
 And even now, in the moments when we fail, God's grace is sufficient.

807
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:40,460
 So even when we fail, we can look to the cross and the empty tomb to know that Christ's death,

808
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:48,160
 Christ's burial, Christ's resurrection is enough, even for our failures today.

809
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,020
 Never get over the gospel.

810
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,500
 Never get over the gospel.

811
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,340
 And some of you are sitting there saying, "I don't even have the chance to get over

812
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,140
 it because I've never truly understood it."

813
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,560
 And so I just say, if you are not a Christian and you are here tonight and you are understanding

814
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,980
 for the first time that when you stand before God, you don't just cross your fingers and

815
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,340
 hope for the best.

816
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:17,640
 Either you will stand before God and you will have to answer for your sin, or you will stand

817
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,980
 before God and Jesus Christ will have already answered for it.

818
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:28,100
 And so your hope is either in Jesus or you're going to cross your fingers and hope for the

819
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,100
 best.

820
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,460
 And I promise you, the Scripture is clear.

821
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,500
 Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.

822
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,580
 No one comes to the Father except through me."

823
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:46,380
 And yet Jesus Christ's invitation to you tonight is to come, to give your life to Him.

824
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:51,420
 And you can experience complete forgiveness for your sin tonight.

825
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,780
 So I'll close just kind of where I started.

826
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,160
 I just want you to think, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years from now, you're going to look back

827
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,080
 to where you are right now in 2023.

828
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,460
 What if you could say, what if you could look back to this season of life and say, "I'm

829
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,900
 so glad that in 2023 God gave me a new heart.

830
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,380
 In 2023 I cultivated my heart for the Lord.

831
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,620
 So I followed my heart because it was a heart that was aligned with God."

832
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,300
 What if you could say, "I embraced where God had me and I'm so glad that I did because

833
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,180
 I didn't sit there in frustration.

834
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,300
 I just said yes to where God had me in 2023."

835
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,620
 What if you could say, "That's when I really went for it.

836
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:40,340
 That's when I started wholeheartedly following Jesus and I'm so glad I did."

837
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,860
 What if you could say, "That's when I began fighting for the biggest view of God possible

838
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,580
 and it has changed my response to Him."

839
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,860
 And what if you could look back and say, "That's when I really began to appreciate the gospel,

840
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:59,620
 not just as my ticket into heaven, but as the way that heaven has been getting into

841
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:07,260
 me every day for 10, 15, 20 years."

842
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:13,860
 May we be a people who walk wisely, where joy is maximized and unnecessary pain is minimized.

843
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,860
 Why?

844
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,540
 Because we know the King, Jesus Christ.

845
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:26,060
 Let's pray together.

846
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,180
 If you're here tonight and you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ, I don't

847
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:35,660
 want to miss an opportunity just to give you a chance to pray the way that we express faith

848
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,860
 to God.

849
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,900
 Romans 10, 9 says that if we confess with our mouths that Jesus is Lord and believe

850
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,100
 in our heart that God raised Him from the dead, then you will be saved.

851
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:53,580
 So I just encourage you now to just say, "Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?

852
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,660
 Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me.

853
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:01,460
 Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.

854
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,620
 Would you come into my life?

855
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,980
 Would you forgive me of my sin?

856
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:15,380
 Would you begin to lead me in a new life?"

857
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,780
 And for the rest of us, what's God saying to you tonight?

858
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,100
 Maybe you're sitting there and you're like, "Okay, this is it.

859
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,660
 This is the day.

860
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:28,960
 Today is finally the day that I'm going to start wholeheartedly following Jesus."

861
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,580
 Maybe there's desires, motivations, passions that you know are not aligned with the Lord

862
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:40,220
 that you just need to confess.

863
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,500
 Maybe your view of God has spawned, you just want to say, "God, would you expand my view

864
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,500
 of you tonight?"

865
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,740
 Or maybe you just want to say, "God, thank you for the good news of the gospel, that

866
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,900
 it's enough."

867
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,740
 Do business with the Lord now.

868
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,300
 We love you, Lord.

869
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,820
 We thank you for all you've done.

870
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,780
 respond to you now.
