 [Music]

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I love it! Let's go!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 You guys, man, you are funny. Hey, welcome friends!

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Let's all do the wave! Woo! Oh my gosh! So ridiculous!

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Welcome friends in the room, and friends in Fort Worth, and in Houston, El Paso.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 This is my family sitting in the front rows.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And Tulsa, College up in the loft, all the different people that are joining us right now from wherever you are.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Hey, anyone a big fan of pineapples?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Yeah, wow! Man, we gotta get you guys out more, okay?

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Here's a little fun fact about pineapples. This probably cost about $2, maybe $3 today.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 But there was a time in the history of the pineapple

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 where a pineapple would have cost you about $8,000.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 This is a terrible pineapple, it's falling apart.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 $8,000.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 With Columbus!

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Oh, I love it! You guys, you got me. I love it, you got me on that one.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Hey, there was a time where Columbus discovered the pineapple in the ancient, in the new world,

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 and he brought this fruit back, and it was such a luxury item.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 They'd never seen anything like it before, and Christopher Columbus discovered it, they brought it back to England,

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 and this thing became like only the elite of the elite had access to a pineapple.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 It becomes such a status symbol that people wouldn't even eat the pineapple.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I mean, true story, in today's money, it would have been the equivalent of $8,000.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Think about that. What I'm holding right now, if you back up to the 1600s and 1700s,

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I mean, this thing would be worth more than my car.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 This thing would be worth, in such a way, you'd be like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe that guy has a pineapple."

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Everyone would gather down front, want to take pictures with the pineapple.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 True story. I mean, this is not crazy.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 In fact, there's even a famous picture by King Charles II of England,

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 where in the 1670s, he commissioned someone to paint, to do a painting of him receiving a pineapple.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 It's hard to see, but that's what that guy's been down holding up.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 "Here's a pineapple for you, sir."

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 That this was such a status symbol in the ancient world.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 There you go, Billy. Enjoy that. You earned it.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 That people who couldn't afford a pineapple,

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 there was somebody who was out there who was a hustler who was like, "Hey, we're going to work around that.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 You may not be able to afford a pineapple, but we will rent you a pineapple

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 that you can take around to parties with you and carry it."

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 No one ate them. They were literally just a status symbol.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 You walk into the house, you'd be like, "Oh my gosh, there's a pineapple on the wall.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 This is incredible. These guys really have arrived in life. Mama made it. Pineapple."

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And it's crazy.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Because today we look at it and we're like, "What?"

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I mean, that's like two to three dollars. No one would keep a pineapple.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 No one thinks it's that big of a deal.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And it just is almost mind-boggling.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Now, what does that have to do with what I'm talking about tonight?

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Well, here's what's interesting.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 The pineapple hasn't changed.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Same fruit. Same kind of prickly outside.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Same top on it.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 The pineapple pointing hasn't changed.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Our perspective on it has.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Thanks to the invention of kind of modern agriculture and modern industry,

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 we've been able to mass produce, you know, not just pineapple, all kinds of foods.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And because of that, the value of this thing that was once seen as such incredibly valuable

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 has plummeted.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But the pineapple hasn't changed.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Just our perspective on it has.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And I think that's such a great parallel and illustration

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 for what we're going to talk about tonight, which is the topic of sex.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 That sex was this thing that was to be this exclusive experience

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 between one man and one woman for life.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 This thing that you would enter into with a spouse, with a husband or a wife,

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 that you would never have to wonder if they were comparing you to someone else

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 because you were the only someone they'd ever been with.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 This thing that you never had to worry, "Am I going to get an STD with this person?"

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And this thing that was of such incredible value that God created

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 and He gave to be experienced exclusively.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Something incredibly valuable that we live in a culture that has so devalued this thing

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 and sex hasn't changed, our perspective on it has.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And we're in a series called "Lyrics and Lies,"

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 and tonight we're going to cover a topic that is wrecking havoc on our country,

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 on many of us in the room, on all of our lives at some point in some way.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 We've all been impacted by the devaluing of sex

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 that has taken place in culture all around us, and particularly,

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 tonight we're going to talk about some of the lies that we've been sold about sex

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 in the songs that we sing, in the songs that we hear,

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 in the songs that really shaped us as we grew up.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 We're in this series called "Lyrics and Lies Anthem Edition."

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 What's "Lyrics and Lies Anthem Edition?"

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's essentially looking back the last 10 to 15 years

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 where we explore some of the songs that shaped so much of our growing up.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Maybe it was your high school, maybe it came out.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 These songs came out when you were in junior high,

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 but just kind of anthems that our generation has rallied around, big hits,

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 that all of them, we all know the songs.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Some of them, they were our ringtones at some point in time.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 They were that song that brings back junior year, "That Someone,"

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 and looking at different lies that were contained in some of them.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 So tonight, we're going to talk about, really, man, I could pick any song like this,

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 and it's going to hit something with a sexual lie inside of it.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 It just seems to be what all of them are about.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But here's one that is probably as famous as any song,

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 and I may go on record as saying maybe the best beat in the 21st century.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I mean, great beats, man.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 The 2000s took first place for sure in the beats,

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 but they introduced something that has been toxic around the topic of sex.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I mean, what I mean by I could, like, literally pick any song.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I mean, think about some of the songs that were famous.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 "Thong Song" by SisqÃ³, "Bootylicious" by Destiny's Child,

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 "Shake Your Tailfeather" by Murphy Lee, "My Chick Bad" by Ludacris,

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 "Lollipop" by Little Wayne.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 That was a test. That was a test.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 And everyone who said "Little Wayne," you are dismissed.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 By Little Wayne, there's so many littles.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Little John, Little Wayne, Little--okay.

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 "Hot in Here" by Nelly. Not hot in here, hot in her.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 "Candy Shop," "Disco Inferno," "Blurred Lines," "Get Low,"

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I mean, "Milkshake." I mean, something happened.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Like, we went in the '90s from, like,

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 âª I want it that way âª

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 to, "To the Window! To the Wall!"

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And I'm going to stop there.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And it's like, dude, wow, that escalated quickly, okay?

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I mean, it just quickly--

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 all of a sudden, culture became so sexualized.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I mean, truly, it just exploded wherever the song--

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 and it only gets worse.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I mean, we were talking to our team today

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 about some of the songs out today,

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 and it's like, man, we have become so desensitized

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 as a culture.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 I mean, songs that our parents or our grandparents

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 would have heard and been like, "Oh, my gosh,"

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 are just kind of like, man, it's awesome.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It's a great beat.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And it is--it's almost disturbing

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 how desensitized myself included,

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 we've all become, some of the message--

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I mean, it's audio porn,

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 especially some of the songs that are coming out today.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 When you look at "Fifi," you look at just any number of the--

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 everything that Nicki Minaj has ever put out.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Or you look at, you know, Post Malone stuff.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 I mean, it's--it's sad.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And is it any wonder, at a time in our world--

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 like, we live in such weird times,

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 because on the one hand, everything is so sexualized.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Like, everything is--like, I can't even read

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 some of the lyrics.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It's like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm uncomfortable,

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 "and I'm your pastor. I can't read this to you."

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 And at the same time,

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 it's clear that there's such dysfunctional sexual behavior

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 that has plagued and is still plaguing

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 so many of the lives in our country.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 We live at a time where--between, you know,

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Lil' Jon or Lil' Wayne putting out "Get Low,"

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 and then you have Harvey Weinstein

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 and everything going on with the Me Too movement.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 We live at a time where rape levels today,

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 according to Megan Meeker, in her book

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 "Strong Fathers and Strong Daughters,"

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 said that 12%, 11.9% of females

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 will experience forced intercourse in their lives.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 We live at a time where STDs among the millennial generation

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 are spiking back up.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 There's been a tremendous decline,

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and for the first time, really, in the past couple decades,

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 they're back on the rise.

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 We're divorced in marriages

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 that have been just eroded or destroyed

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 because of sexual unfaithfulness of a partner.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 We're abortion.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 A million children will be aborted in 2018

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 because of sex outside of the context of marriage

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 in an unwanted pregnancy.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 That's 3,000 children a day in our country,

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 just our country,

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 in a time where sex outside of marriage

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 is so responsible for not just abortion,

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 but also for single-parent homes.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 For the very first time, a majority, 54%,

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 of children will be raised in a single-parent household,

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 54%, where sex has clearly had

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 all kinds of catastrophic impact on our lives.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 We sing it, and we celebrate it,

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 and these musicians promote it.

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Inside of the music are such deep,

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 destructive, and toxic lies.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We're gonna talk about a couple of them tonight.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Specifically, what's interesting and challenging

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 about this subject is I think there's really,

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 there's a lot of lies contained in some of these songs,

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 but there's a message consistently projected to the men

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 and consistently projected to the women,

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and they're slightly different.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It's important to distinguish them

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 because I think they impact each of us in different ways

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 among the lines of men and women.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So I'm gonna talk first about the lies

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 that are being told to men,

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 and then I wanna look at some of the lies

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 that are being told to women,

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 and then I wanna look at some of the remedies

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 from God's Word that we're told

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 in response to these lies that we can live by.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 So the first one, let's talk about the lies

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 that are coming to men,

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 and that's as clearly or as simply as I can put it

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 that women are sex objects.

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 I mean, this is every song,

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 whether it's "Shake Your Tail Feather" in the club,

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Akon, smack that,

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 is that women are here for sex.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You should sleep with them.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 You should have sex with whoever, whenever,

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 as often as you can, however.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 That women are there, and essentially,

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 the benefit that women are there to provide for men,

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 you should see them as sex objects.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What do I mean by that?

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I mean, look at Ludacris in Usher's famous

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 or well-known song, "Yeah."

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I'm just gonna read some of his lyrics,

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 and when you stop and read 'em, you're like,

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 oh, wow, man, I can't believe you said that.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So here, I'll read 'em and kind of unpack.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 My outfit's so ridiculous,

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 in this club looking so conspicuous.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 He's proud of his outfit.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And, "Row, these women all on the prowl.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 "If you hold your head steady, I'm gonna milk the cow."

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 I'm not even gonna go into that,

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 because that's a sexual innuendo

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 I'm uncomfortable even reading.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 "Forget about the game, I'm gonna spit the truth.

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 "I won't stop until I get 'em in their birthday suits."

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And I don't think he means suits with balloons on the outside.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 I think he means naked.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 "So give me the rhythm, and it'll be off with their clothes.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 "Then bend over to the front and touch your toes.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 "I left the jag and I took the rolls.

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 "If they ain't cutting it, then I put 'em on foot patrol."

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Basically, hey, I'm not gonna stop

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 until they get their clothes off,

237
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and if they won't comply, they can walk

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 and not have a ride in the car.

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 "So give me the rhythm, and it'll be off.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 "How you like me now when my pinkies valued over 300,000?"

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 He's got a big ring.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 "And let's drink, either one to please.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 "Ludacris fills cups like double Ds."

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 I have no idea other than he's clearly talking about boobs.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 "Me and us once more, we'll leave 'em dead.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 "We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed."

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Then you look at songs like "Blurred Lines"

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 and T.I. in his part of that song.

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 "So I'm watching and waiting for you to salute

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 "the true big pimpin'.

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 "Not many women can refuse this pimpin'.

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 "I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused.

253
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 "This is pimpin', so I don't want to be any confusion here.

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 "I am here to use you for sex," T.I. says.

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 So right there, we read it, or we played it earlier.

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 "I like the way you look in them pants, see you fine.

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "Your mama a quarter piece, she's far from a dime."

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Not sure why he even goes there, but.

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 (congregation laughing)

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 "The type of girl that'll get you up and go make you grind.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 "I'm thinking about snatching her up dirty, making her mine.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 "Look at her hips, what, look at her legs, ain't she stacked?

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 "I'm sure I wouldn't mind hitting that from the back."

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 There is a clear message in each one of these songs

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 that women are there and they're sex objects

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 to be lusted over or to sleep with if you can.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And it is so toxic.

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And I know it seems like these are extreme things,

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 but when you think about the ways that men,

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 myself included, you are being bombarded every day

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 with this lie that women are sex objects.

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And it feels like, oh, that's a little extreme.

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Would I really be bombarded?

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I mean, just think about the way that sex

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 has been so commercialized in our culture.

276
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 The pornography epidemic, which only feeds into this,

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 which is a bigger business industry than ABC, NBC,

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 and CBS combined, bigger than the NFL,

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 bigger than the NBA, one third of internet traffic

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 is pornography, all of it's feeding into this.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 To just even candidly, the hyper-sexualization

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 that you can't escape, men, and neither can I.

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 What do I mean by that?

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I mean, imagine if you lived in a time in a world

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 where the very first time that you ever saw a woman

286
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 in her underwear or in a bikini was on your wedding night.

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 You can't live in that world.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Society around us has taken that option.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 What do I mean by that?

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 I can't drive down the highway

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 without seeing a woman in a bikini.

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 You can't turn on TV, you can't watch a commercial

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 without seeing cleavage thrust in front of you.

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And so I have deep sympathy,

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 but I want us to all be on the same page

296
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 and know, men, there is a war,

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and you are under an attack by an enemy

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 who wants to take you out and wants to take that sex drive

299
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 and let it drive your life to pornography,

300
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 to abuse, to introducing sex into a relationship,

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 to one-night stands, that there is an enemy

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 that wants to take you out.

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And I don't even think we realize how immersed we are

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 in the sexualization that has taken place all around us.

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 It is so far from the biblical values

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 that, tragically, that we're to have,

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 and it's a tragedy that we're so far.

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 What do I mean by biblical values?

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 That Paul says, "Hey, this is what I want the young men to do.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 "I want younger men to treat older women as mothers,"

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 1 Timothy 5, verse 2,

312
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 "and younger women, or young women, as sisters

313
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 "with absolute purity."

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And our culture around us, at the same time,

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 that chastises men who clearly abuse,

316
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 who clearly follow the lies that the culture is feeding us,

317
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 that's what Harvey Weinstein is doing.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It's disgusting, let's be clear.

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But he's logically following what the message,

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 that the men inside of this room,

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 you're being fed every single day.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 I'm gonna talk about what we do in response to that.

323
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 But it's clearly what's happening.

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Essentially, what we're being told,

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 what the music we listen to tells us,

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 what so many of the messages that you hear,

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 is, hey, women are something you use,

328
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 and then you kinda, when you're done with it,

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 you trade it in or you get rid of it.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Essentially, like, hey, treat women like a rental car.

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 What do I mean by that?

332
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 A rental car is something that, hey, you use, you keep it,

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 you keep it for a time, but then when you're done with it,

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 you kinda get rid of it.

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 You don't really pour time and energy into it.

336
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Like, no one in the room has ever gone

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 and gotten an oil change on their rental car.

338
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Do we agree there?

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 No one is like, you know, I was gonna take this back to Hertz,

340
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 but I'm gonna get the car washed,

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 really clean this thing up a little.

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 No, everyone's like, I don't care,

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I lift trash all over it, I get the insurance,

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and I drive it any way that I want.

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 That is what culture is saying men are to do,

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 as it relates to women.

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And is there any wonder how messed up

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 our society is around this issue?

349
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And the lie that's being told to women is just as toxic.

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 What do I mean by that?

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 The second idea I wanna talk about tonight

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 is the lie that's being told to women.

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 The lie that's being told to women, which is this.

354
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 You ladies should use your body to get what you want.

355
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Use your body, whether that's in the way that you dress,

356
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 in the way that you dance, in the way that you look,

357
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 in the way that you, you know, in sex.

358
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Use your body.

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Men are being told to use, women are being told,

360
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 hey, use your body to get what you want.

361
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 What do I mean by that?

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 You read songs, I mean, there's so many different examples,

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 but one that we just heard from,

364
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 from Black Eyed Peas, My Humps.

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 My love, my love, my love, your lovely lady lumps.

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So her curves.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 My hump, my hump, my hump, my humps, they got you.

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 She got me spending, oh, spending all my money on me

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 and spending time on me.

370
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 She got me spending, oh, spending all your money on me.

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Oh, oh, oh my gosh.

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 This is bad grammar.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Time on me.

374
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 What you gonna do with all that junk inside of that trunk?

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 I'm gonna get you drunk, get you drunk,

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 get you love drunk off my hump.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Then I'm gonna use it to lure you in.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 I'm gonna use it as bait and intoxicate you.

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Or Kaleese, milkshake.

380
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 My milkshake, my body and the way that it moves

381
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 brings all the boys to the yard.

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Not sure which yard she's talking about,

383
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 but and they're like, it's better than yours, right?

384
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's better than yours.

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 I can teach you, but I have to charge.

386
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 and they're like, it's better than yours, right?

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 It's better than yours.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I can teach you, but I have to charge.

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I know you want it.

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 The thing that makes me what guys go crazy for,

392
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 they lose their mind for,

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 the way I wind, I think it's time.

394
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 The message, essentially to women, is similar.

395
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 It's essentially like, hey dude, the guys out there,

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 they are like crazy about women and their curves

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 and their bodies and they just can't,

398
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 you should use that to your advantage.

399
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Use it to get the things that you want.

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Use it to, whether the things you want are like,

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 hey, I just want free drinks tonight.

402
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Whether the things you want are attention from that guy,

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 he's kind of cute over there,

404
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I'm gonna pose in a certain way.

405
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It may not even be in terms of a relationship.

406
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 It may be like, hey, kind of use it to get out of a ticket

407
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 and I'm flirting, wink, wink, and here we go.

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Use it to get a job.

409
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Use it, you should use your body to get what you want.

410
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 It may just be you had a hard day

411
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 and you want some attention or affirmation,

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 and that's okay.

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And it is a lie.

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And it's furthering the divide

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 and it's making the problem worse.

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And on both sides, it's broken.

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 On both sides, it's a lie.

418
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 The reason use your body as bait

419
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 to get a guy is so dangerous,

420
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 let me try to be clear,

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 is it will work.

422
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Like if you use your body as bait to get a guy,

423
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 it's gonna work.

424
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 I don't think you're gonna like the guy

425
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 that you're gonna get.

426
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 But if you use your body as bait, it's gonna work.

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 There's a guy out there that would love to take that bait.

428
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 You know, in fishing, I don't know if we have

429
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 many fishers in the room, I'm not a huge fisherman,

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I have family that loves to fish,

431
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 but one thing I do know, having spent time with fishermen,

432
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 is that the bait that you choose to use

433
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 will determine the fish that you catch.

434
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Glad everyone came, in case you don't feel like

435
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 you're getting your money's worth, how about that?

436
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 The bait that you use, in terms of, is it a worm,

437
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 or is it a piece of meat, or hot dog, or whatever it is,

438
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 the bait you use will determine the fish that you catch.

439
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 All the fishermen are like, did he say hot dog right now?

440
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 He has no idea what he's talking about.

441
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But he is accurate in that the bait you use

442
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 determines the fish that you catch.

443
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 The bait that you use will determine the type of guy

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 that you're gonna catch.

445
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And I don't, as your brother in Christ,

446
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 as someone who is deeply concerned

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and cares about you sisters,

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I do not think you're going to like the guy that you catch

449
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 if your body is your bait.

450
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 You're gonna catch a guy who wants you for your body,

451
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 which means he will trade you in

452
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 for another body as soon as possible.

453
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Let me say it a little bit more clearly.

454
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 If you catch a guy because of your boobs,

455
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 you will lose him because of your boobs to some other girl.

456
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 You are going to attract a type of guy you do not want.

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And so if you play the game that,

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 hey, I'm gonna dress a certain way,

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I'm gonna take pictures in a certain way

460
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 to show off and accentuate,

461
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 you're gonna get attention for sure.

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I just don't think you're gonna get attention

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 from the type of guys that you're gonna want long-term,

464
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 from the type of guys who are following Jesus

465
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 wholeheartedly.

466
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I think the biggest temptation in the room,

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 if I'm sitting there,

468
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 from just my friends, ladies here,

469
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 is that there's something almost vindicating.

470
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 The temptation is like, I'm gonna use my body

471
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 to almost kind of get back some of the control.

472
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 'Cause I sit here and there's a bunch of guys

473
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 and they don't ask out

474
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 and they just kind of sit on their hands,

475
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 they're all passive, so I'm gonna kind of take action

476
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and I'm gonna get out there.

477
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Not just that, there's also like,

478
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 man, guys can be total jerks.

479
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They don't call me back.

480
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 They tell me they're gonna do something and they don't.

481
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And so I can kind of come out here

482
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and it feels like empowering to kind of dress a certain way,

483
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 get attention in a certain way.

484
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And it's a response because of being hurt.

485
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 There's a temptation essentially to like,

486
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 man, I'm gonna put myself in the driver's seat

487
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 in how I dress, how I look, and how I behave.

488
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And tragically, the answer is not to try

489
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 to put yourself in the driver's seat

490
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 by the way that you dress or with your sexuality.

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 The answer is to change the people

492
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 that you're driving in the car with.

493
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 There are godly men out there

494
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 who are not looking for you to dress in a certain way,

495
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 wear a certain level of clothes,

496
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and if those are the guys that you're hanging out with,

497
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 you're hanging out with the wrong guys.

498
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 You may be thinking, uh, duh, that's all guys out there.

499
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 You are hanging out in the wrong spots.

500
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 To be clear, there's a lot of guys inside of this room

501
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 who are like that.

502
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And they're looking for bait and they wanna zoom in

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 and they're running towards just whatever fits the curves

504
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and the humps that they're looking for.

505
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 That's in this room.

506
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 But there's a lot of godly men in this room.

507
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 There's like a lot of godly men out there

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 who are not looking for curves,

509
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 they're looking for a woman who has character.

510
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And if you date someone,

511
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 and the reason why they're attracted to you

512
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 is simply your curves, you are dating someone

513
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 who is with you because of a depreciating asset.

514
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 He's dating you because of something

515
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 that is not gonna last.

516
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 If you date a guy just because of the way he looks,

517
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 you're dating someone for a depreciating asset,

518
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 something that's not gonna last.

519
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Gravity wins on all of us.

520
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It just does.

521
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Can I get an amen from somebody over 28?

522
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Thank you.

523
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's like, dang, my back is hurting

524
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 and all I did was like dry off out of the shower.

525
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I'm so old.

526
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And at the same time, I am so sorry.

527
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 For the guys who have mistreated the girls in this room.

528
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 They may not have even been here,

529
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 but you didn't deserve that.

530
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 And sadly, it's all too common of an experience,

531
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 but at the same time, the answer is not

532
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 to take back control and get in the driver's seat

533
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 by seeking to use your body to get what you want.

534
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 The answer is surround yourself with people

535
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 following Jesus and you follow Jesus.

536
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And that problem is likely to fix itself.

537
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Will it be wolves?

538
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Is there someone that could appear on the outside

539
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 like they're following Jesus?

540
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Yes.

541
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But you would tremendously increase your chances

542
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 of dating the wrong guy or the wrong girl

543
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 if you date outside of God's people

544
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 and you don't date in community

545
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 with other believers inside of your life

546
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 speaking into that.

547
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I, candidly, I have a daughter that's 12 weeks old now

548
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 and my heart breaks for her

549
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 and for so many girls in this room.

550
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 It is disgusting, the sexualization of women.

551
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And my heart, candidly, is fearful over the temptation

552
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 that she's gonna feel that she needs to behave a certain way,

553
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 have some sort of sexual experience

554
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 which still, all the temptations that are gonna rush in

555
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 because all the messages that are being fed to you every day

556
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 about how you need to look, how sexual you need to be,

557
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 be a virgin but also be a lady in the street

558
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 and a freak in the bed,

559
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 all the different things that are just so messed up.

560
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 But I want you to know that the answer

561
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 is not living according to what the world says.

562
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Anytime that we do, we always invite,

563
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 anytime we bring sex outside of what God's word says

564
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and live and bring it in line with what the world says,

565
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 we always bring scars into our life.

566
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 What do I mean by that?

567
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I was reading a book this past week

568
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 and inside of the book it basically was talking about,

569
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 it was drawing a parallel between how sharks,

570
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 when they mate or have sex, this took a left turn,

571
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 they'll bring scars or they have scars

572
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 that happen on their body.

573
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And what do I mean by that?

574
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Basically, the book was saying how you can identify

575
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 a female, a great white shark or shark in general

576
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 and you can tell if she's of mating age

577
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 because she'll have scars on the side of her body

578
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 because the male shark has to hold on somehow

579
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 so he'll bite onto the female shark

580
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 and it leaves scars behind.

581
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Interestingly enough, the female shark's skin

582
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 is twice as thick as the male shark's because of that.

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 So you can see on sharks, you can look it up later

584
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 or now or not.

585
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 (laughing)

586
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 That's weird.

587
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But you can see these scars that basically communicate sex.

588
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Sex brings scars.

589
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And the reason that's so just profound

590
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 is not just with sharks that sex brings scars,

591
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 it's with all of us.

592
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Not just physically on the outside, usually not,

593
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I mean maybe that's possible,

594
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 but emotionally, spiritually, mentally.

595
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 What do I mean by scars?

596
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I mean think about it.

597
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 When I think about scars, I think about the friend,

598
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 the family friend whose entire family just disintegrated

599
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 after their dad's sexual sin was exposed.

600
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 That's a scar, sex brought.

601
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 I think about the friend who was molested

602
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 by a family member at a young age, scar.

603
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Some of the deepest wounds inside of this room, I know,

604
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 are from sex and they're scars.

605
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Anytime sex is introduced outside of the context

606
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 of marriage, scars.

607
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 I think about the friend who was raped by a stranger

608
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 in her own home, scar.

609
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 I think about the friend whose wife struggles

610
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 with sexual intimacy because of the shame of her past

611
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 and the memories it brings up, that's a scar.

612
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Think about the friend who got pregnant

613
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 after casually hooking up with a guy

614
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 and had an abortion.

615
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And every year on the anniversary of that decision,

616
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 she weeps, thinking about the age

617
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 the child would have been, scar.

618
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Sex always brings scars outside of marriage.

619
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I think about the pastor who was exposed to pornography

620
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 in junior high in a hotel with other boys

621
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 on their way to church camp and battled pornography

622
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 for nine years in the shame and guilt

623
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 and all the ways it made him not honor women.

624
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 That's my scar, that's one of them.

625
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Anytime we introduce sex outside of the context

626
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 of marriage, it always brings scars.

627
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And the God who's there, he's not anti-sex.

628
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 He's crazy, he invented sex, that's absurd.

629
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Every time people are like, man, the devil's

630
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 sexist rock and roll, at least sex is not on his side.

631
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 All of them really would be on God's side.

632
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 But at least for sure that one.

633
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 No one's accusing Steve Jobs of being like,

634
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 you're anti-iPhone, dude, that's what you are.

635
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 That would not make any sense.

636
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 God is, he's the inventor of sex.

637
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 There's commands in the Bible that say,

638
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Proverbs chapter five, it's a command.

639
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Husbands, let the breasts of your wife

640
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 satisfy you contiguously.

641
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Always be intoxicated in her love.

642
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 That is a command from God.

643
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Think about that.

644
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 It's not anti-sex, that's absurd.

645
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 He's pro-sex and he's pro-you.

646
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 And he knows that sex outside of marriage

647
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 always brings scars.

648
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Finally, the third idea I just wanna talk about briefly

649
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 and then we'll land the plane,

650
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 is just what's the remedy for these lies?

651
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And the remedy for the lies is always what the remedy,

652
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 anytime there's a lie is, which is the truth.

653
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 The remedy is replacing the lies with the truth.

654
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 What truth am I talking about?

655
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I wanna talk to the girls for just a second.

656
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And guys, you're in the room, so I'm talking to everybody.

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Your value has nothing to do with how sexually,

658
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 how sexual you are, your sex appeal,

659
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 the way that you look, your body.

660
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Your value is esteem to give to you

661
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 because of one reason.

662
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 You are made in the image of God.

663
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Let me be clear.

664
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Genesis chapter one, verses 26, 27,

665
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 it says that in the beginning,

666
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 God created the male and female.

667
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 In the image of God, he created them.

668
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 What does that mean?

669
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Maybe you came into the room and you're like,

670
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 man, guys are made in the image of God

671
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 and females are kinda like, hey, we're here to help.

672
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 That is a lie.

673
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Men and women have been made equally in the image of God.

674
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 In other words, if you got rid of all the women,

675
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 you would lose part of the image of God

676
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 that's reflected in mankind.

677
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.

678
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.

679
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.

680
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 (congregation applauding)

681
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 The value that you have has nothing to do

682
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 with what a guy says about you,

683
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 with how good you are in bed.

684
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Your value has nothing to do with the past that you have.

685
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Your value has been given by God.

686
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 You cannot lose it even if you wanted to.

687
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.

688
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And this is important because here's what I know.

689
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 If you're in the room, the way that you see yourself,

690
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 the guys in your life are going to adopt

691
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 and embrace the way that you see yourself.

692
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You think you're damaged goods,

693
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 you think you're not worth anything,

694
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 the men in your life that are gonna surround you

695
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 are gonna be men who think you're damaged goods,

696
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 not worth anything, and they will take advantage of that.

697
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Your value has nothing to do with your past,

698
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 has nothing to do with your present,

699
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 has nothing to do with the way that you look.

700
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 It has been given by God.

701
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 You couldn't lose it if you wanted to.

702
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 You have been made in the image of God.

703
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 This is why pornography for all of us is so dangerous,

704
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 because it communicates that a woman is just there for sex,

705
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 she's a sex object, two-dimensional idea on a screen.

706
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Your value has nothing to do with the way that you look.

707
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 The second idea I want to talk about

708
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 is around the topic of modesty.

709
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Everyone's favorite topic.

710
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 I also, 1 Timothy 2, verse nine and 10 says this,

711
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 I also want women to dress modestly,

712
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 with decency and propriety, adorning themselves

713
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls

714
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 or expensive clothes, but with good deeds

715
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 appropriate for women who profess to worship God.

716
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Paul, what are you saying?

717
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 You can't wear seven jeans or pearls?

718
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 No, he's saying I want you to be considerate

719
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 of the way that you dress, I want you to dress modestly.

720
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Now, stay with me, 'cause inside of the room,

721
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 a couple responses are going on.

722
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 One is that the vibe can kind of be like,

723
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Christians are always like, hey, modest is hottest.

724
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Not really.

725
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 (audience laughing)

726
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 And I want to address that.

727
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 We live in a world where men are being forced

728
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 these images all the time.

729
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 And there is something carnal in every single guy

730
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 inside of this room, every girl inside of this room,

731
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 but it's being fed, and there's messages that,

732
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 hey, what's really hot is women should look a certain way,

733
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 women should look a certain way.

734
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Is there part of every guy that likes the way

735
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Beyonce inappropriately dresses at the halftime show?

736
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Yes.

737
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 But it doesn't make it right.

738
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And you can either be a part of perpetuating the problem

739
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 or helping and providing a solution by dressing modestly

740
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 for your brothers in the room, and you may be like,

741
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 that's their problem, if they lust over me, you know,

742
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I could be like in an astronaut suit,

743
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 and you'd be like, what's up, girl, astronaut?

744
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 Yes, that is true.

745
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 But it doesn't mean you have license to dress

746
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 however that you want.

747
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Is it our problem? Yes, it's our problem.

748
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 The Bible commands you are to dress modestly.

749
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Not frumpily, and not in like a, you know, burlap sack.

750
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Be stylish, go all in.

751
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Whatever that means.

752
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 But help your brothers in the room

753
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 by dressing modestly.

754
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 That means including on your social media,

755
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 and this is where I'm just gonna lean in a little bit more here.

756
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 That's what we do. Welcome to the porch.

757
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 That means being cognizant of what you post,

758
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 being aware, mindful of what you post on social media.

759
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 It means, candidly,

760
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 you may not want to put the bikini pic

761
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 as your profile picture.

762
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Awkward.

763
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And that's not because you are, not 'cause you don't,

764
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 I'm not trying to stymie, maybe I am trying to stymie,

765
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Paul's trying to stymie, let's blame it on Paul.

766
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 That's what Paul's trying to do here.

767
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Help your brothers and sisters in the room.

768
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 You will get attention for the way that you dress.

769
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 It may not be the right type of attention.

770
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And it may not honor God.

771
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Men, I think the lies around women are sex object

772
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 is something that you are gonna face,

773
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 and I face every single day.

774
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 And the best action step or truth that you've got to embrace

775
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 is you've got to pursue healing.

776
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Maybe for the rest of your life.

777
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 You've got to kill pornography.

778
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 You've got to get rid of,

779
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 you've got to be mindful of what you're feeding yourself.

780
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Maybe you're watching Netflix.

781
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 There's so much junk on Netflix

782
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 that's just as bad as pornography.

783
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Be mindful of the songs or the things that you're listening to.

784
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 The reason pornography, as I said earlier, is so dangerous

785
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 is it feeds the lie women are objects.

786
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And further, it's every time you watch it,

787
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 you're going to school, and you're getting taught,

788
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 hey, that one woman is not enough,

789
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 and a real woman is not enough.

790
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And you are hurting, if not ruining your marriage,

791
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 long before you even get married.

792
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 It will not go away.

793
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 You've got to kill it.

794
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 You've got to live in community and confess

795
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 and live honestly with other guys.

796
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 If you are in the room and you would say, "I struggle.

797
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 "I got an email today, an email yesterday."

798
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Constantly we get it from guys

799
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 as it relates to struggling with pornography.

800
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 The same thing happens every time they come down front

801
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 or they'll talk, they want to meet,

802
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 struggling with pornography,

803
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 want to really experience freedom from it.

804
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Well, tell me what struggling looks like.

805
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 Where's your phone?

806
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And they'll pull out their phone, and they have an iPhone,

807
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 iPhone 10, they have an iPhone.

808
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And they are walking around with the thing

809
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 that gives them access to pornography.

810
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 It would be like someone who's an alcoholic

811
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 walking around with a flask.

812
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 You may have to do what Jesus says in Matthew chapter five,

813
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 go to extreme lengths, where he uses an analogy saying,

814
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 cut off your hand even if you have to,

815
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 where you have to go back to getting a razor phone

816
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 for a season, and you're like, "I can't get a razor."

817
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 How badly do you want to be healed?

818
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 You need to get Covenant Eyes.

819
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 I cannot advertise and commit or talk enough

820
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 about Covenant Eyes, which is a software

821
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 that you can put onto your computer

822
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 that will help monitor the websites that you're going to.

823
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 And this is speaking from someone

824
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 who faces the same temptation every single day.

825
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 That the truth that you've got to embrace

826
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 is you have got to move towards healing.

827
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 And that involves community and living authentically

828
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 with other guys inside of your life.

829
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 This changed my life.

830
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 My junior year of college, coming honest with other dudes

831
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 and opening up about pornography,

832
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 and getting Covenant Eyes, it changed my life.

833
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Freedom is possible, and you can experience it.

834
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Finally, I want to say,

835
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 finally, to the guys,

836
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 and then I have one more thing to everyone.

837
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 You've got to reject what the world tells you

838
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 to look for in a woman.

839
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 That it is not curves that you're looking for,

840
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 some, hey, I'm a butt guy or boob guy.

841
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 You are looking for character.

842
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I cannot highly communicate and encourage that enough.

843
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I've been on set for almost 10 years.

844
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 I can't tell you the number of stories

845
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 of people who married, wow, she was a knockout,

846
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 and their marriage went to ashes.

847
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 What was like, man, she's incredible, the sex is amazing,

848
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 and then they weren't believers,

849
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 and maybe they were kind of like marginally,

850
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 they were cultural Christians, essentially,

851
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 sleeping together before they got married.

852
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 They ended up getting married, she was a knockout,

853
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 and they were miserable together.

854
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 When I compare that to the men and women

855
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 who married one another, not because of their bust size,

856
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 but because of their commitment to Jesus,

857
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 it's undeniable the difference.

858
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 And it's not even close in terms of those

859
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 who are happily married.

860
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 You've gotta reject what the world says around us.

861
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Ladies, candidly, you've gotta reject what the world says.

862
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 To the men, you are looking for a godly woman of character.

863
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Of character.

864
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Finally, the last lie that I think you've gotta replace

865
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 with the truth is that your past does not define you.

866
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Your past does not define you.

867
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Your past does not define you.

868
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 If you trust in Jesus and you walk with him,

869
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 regardless of your sexual sin in your past,

870
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 regardless of the sexual baggage that you may carry,

871
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 regardless of the abuse, that wasn't your fault.

872
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 It wasn't your fault.

873
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 Regardless of what you carry around,

874
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 God is not done with you, your past does not define you.

875
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 And if you will take those things to Jesus,

876
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 there's no limit to which he can't rewrite

877
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 the story in your life.

878
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 This is personal to me.

879
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 I have a very close member of my family

880
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 who says things like, man, a godly guy

881
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 would never want a girl like me.

882
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 That is a lie.

883
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 A godly guy will see you, if you're in the room,

884
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 I want you to listen.

885
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 If you've ever wondered that, if you've ever thought like,

886
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 man, that works for the preacher boy up there,

887
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 and yeah, kind of all these perfect people

888
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 that have it all together, but that wouldn't work for me,

889
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 a godly guy would never like a girl like me.

890
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 You have bought a lie.

891
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 A godly guy, just like a godly woman,

892
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 will see you like Jesus would see you, and does see you.

893
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 What do I mean by that?

894
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Jesus, the perfect one of God, a godly guy,

895
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 will see people like Jesus sees people.

896
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 How did Jesus see sexually broken people,

897
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 which was everyone, how did he see maybe

898
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 the extreme sexually broken person,

899
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 the person who can't even talk about what they've done?

900
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Well, we're actually told multiple times.

901
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 We're told of an occasion with a woman,

902
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 and one story in particular, in John chapter eight.

903
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 And in John chapter eight, this woman

904
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 who's been caught in adultery, she's caught having sex

905
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 with a man who's not her husband,

906
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 and she's caught having a sexual sin

907
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 that the law said she deserved to die for.

908
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 And she's dragged in front of Jesus, caught red-handed.

909
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 Jesus, we caught her.

910
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 The law says we should kill her.

911
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 What do you say?

912
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Jesus bends over, this crowd of men standing around,

913
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 and a woman in the middle.

914
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 And we're told he begins writing with his finger in the dirt.

915
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 We don't even know what.

916
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 And he looks up and he says,

917
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 "Let him without sin cast the first stone."

918
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And the Bible says that one by one,

919
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 from the oldest to the youngest, the men walked away.

920
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And left was just Jesus and the woman.

921
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And Jesus bent back down, wrote again.

922
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And then Jesus looked up, and here's what he said.

923
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 John chapter eight, verse 10, Jesus said,

924
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 "Woman, where are they?

925
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 "Has no one condemned you?

926
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 "No one, sir.

927
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 "Then neither do I condemn you."

928
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Jesus declared, "Now go and leave your life of sin."

929
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 He says, "I don't condemn you.

930
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 "I don't condone your sin, but I do not condemn you."

931
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 How would a godly guy or a godly girl

932
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 see someone who has a sexually broken past

933
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 if they're a godly person like Jesus?

934
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 They will see them like Jesus sees them.

935
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 As a person that is just like them,

936
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 a candidate for God's grace,

937
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 who God can use, who God can restore,

938
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 who can be a part of experiencing the healing

939
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 that only Jesus offers and brings.

940
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 I'll close here.

941
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I mentioned that idea of just sex brings scars.

942
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 And the sexual sin in my life has brought scars.

943
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Jesus can heal and he is healing them.

944
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 Sexual sin in your life has brought scars.

945
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 But the scars in your life and in my life

946
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 are just represented by our sexual sin

947
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 are not the only scars that were brought about.

948
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 There were other scars that were brought and introduced.

949
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 And unlike the scars in your life that don't communicate

950
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 how valuable you are, your sexual past,

951
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 when you think back, "Oh man, that hurts,"

952
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 or, "Man, what was done to you,"

953
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 it doesn't communicate how valuable you are.

954
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 That's not where your scars communicate.

955
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 These scars do.

956
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 They're the scars brought about by your sexual sin,

957
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 every decision that you made to sleep with that person,

958
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 to give your body away,

959
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 every abortion collectively represented

960
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 in the room to everyone listening online,

961
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 every decision that was made to look at pornography,

962
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 every decision to make to go to the strip club,

963
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 every decision sexually that was sinful

964
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 brought about these scars.

965
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 And they're the scars that are now currently

966
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 on the hands and legs of the Savior, Jesus,

967
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 who said, "I will go to such great lengths

968
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 "that I will bring about scars on my own body

969
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 "that do not communicate regret and baggage and pain.

970
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 "They communicate how valuable you are to God."

971
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 What do I mean by that?

972
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Listen really closely and I'm shutting it down.

973
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 We are landing this plane right here.

974
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 What do I mean by that?

975
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 The value of a thing, Economics 101, you remember it?

976
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 Anyone take Economics?

977
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 Economics 101, the value of a thing is determined

978
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 by what it will bring.

979
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 The value of something is determined

980
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 by what someone's willing to pay for it.

981
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 That's what determines its value.

982
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 I could say my car's worth a million dollars.

983
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 I could say, but at the end of the day,

984
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 it's only worth what someone will pay for it.

985
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 What is your value?

986
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 What is the value you have?

987
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Some of you in the room,

988
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 you think you are not worth anything.

989
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 Some of you think that you're worth what you did today.

990
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 The value you have, let me tell you very clearly,

991
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 the value of a thing is determined by what it will bring.

992
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 What did your life bring?

993
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 The son of God, who would lay down his life,

994
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 whose scars communicate how valuable you are to God,

995
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 despite your past, despite your present.

996
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 That's how loved that you are.

997
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 You've searched and maybe you've searched

998
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 and looked at all kinds of places to feel wanted.

999
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 That's the number one reason guys look at pornography.

1000
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 It's the number one reason why girls give themselves away.

1001
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 And all along, the truth of the matter is,

1002
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 you've been wanted all along, so desperately wanted.

1003
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 How much more valuable could you be?

1004
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 You couldn't.

1005
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 You are more valuable to God than anything else,

1006
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 that he would give his own life for you.

1007
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Your value is not determined by what you wear,

1008
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 the way you look, by what you've done.

1009
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 It was determined at a cross named Calvary.

1010
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Or on a hill named Calvary.

1011
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 And a cross that rested there.

1012
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 There's no story in the room that God is done with.

1013
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 The years the locusts have eaten,

1014
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 he could restore and he will restore.

1015
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 If you will return to him, if you will walk with him.

1016
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Many of you, you need to hear me loud and clear.

1017
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 It wasn't your fault.

1018
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 And healing is offered.

1019
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 Perfectly, I don't know.

1020
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 I know permanently in eternity.

1021
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 But it's the best shot we got.

1022
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 It's the only shot our world has, candidly.

1023
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
 A world that's so sexually messed up.

1024
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 And we have the solution.

1025
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 It's not in a hashtag.

1026
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 It's in Jesus.

1027
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 And it's offered to you, it's offered to me.

1028
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 Let me pray.

1029
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 (soft music)

1030
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 God, unlike the pineapple,

1031
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 which value has gone up and down and changed,

1032
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 the value of my friends in the room has not.

1033
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 It was determined, it was set, it was paid for, it was done.

1034
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 Life of even your son.

1035
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 God, I pray for anyone in this room

1036
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 who has never trusted in Jesus as the payment for their sin.

1037
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 They carry the shame and guilt and regret

1038
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 from decisions they made that may have something to do

1039
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 with sexual sin, may have just all across the board,

1040
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 that right now you would speak to them,

1041
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 minister to them, press on their heart,

1042
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 and that they tonight would receive just forgiveness,

1043
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 take a step in the direction of healing.

1044
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 I pray that you would destroy the shackles

1045
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 of pornography in this room.

1046
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 The men would confess and women would confess

1047
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 and we'd begin to experience healing.

1048
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 I pray for anyone who's sitting here

1049
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 just believing a lie from the enemy

1050
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 that they're damaged goods.

1051
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 That you would break through in a way

1052
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 that my words couldn't, the song we're about to sing couldn't,

1053
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 and you would renew their mind around who they are.

1054
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 Which is who you say that they are.

1055
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 Yours, forgiven, chosen, pure,

1056
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 and there is no story too messed up for you to heal,

1057
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 for a plot twist to come in,

1058
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 something to take place beyond even anything we could imagine.

1059
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 And so God, would you unleash that now.

1060
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 We confess we are sexually broken

1061
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 and we have walked in sexual sin, Lord.

1062
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 And we receive your forgiveness by grace,

1063
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 by trusting in what Jesus did for us,

1064
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 dying in our place and rising from the dead.

1065
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 We are who you say we are, God.

1066
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
 We worship you now in song, amen.

1067
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:33,000
