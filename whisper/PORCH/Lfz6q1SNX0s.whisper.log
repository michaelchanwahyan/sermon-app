[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:22.900]   - I love it.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.720]   Well, that's right.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.920]   We are continuing our series Bad Advice tonight.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.880]   Welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.640]   and in Houston and in Spring and El Paso and Tulsa
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.100]   and tuning in wherever you are.
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.760]   Has anyone ever heard of the term a sneezer before?
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.640]   It's a business term and here's what I know.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.720]   You may not know what that word means,
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.660]   but you know someone who is a sneezer.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.500]   I'll tell you what a sneezer is.
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.880]   A sneezer is someone who spreads ideas or experiences
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.020]   or things that they really like,
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.280]   like a virus or a contagion.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.400]   Like they're the kind of person,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.080]   everyone knows a guy who's a sneezer.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.720]   Everyone knows a girl or a guy who's a sneezer.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.560]   They're the kind of person who,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.160]   when they experience something they really like,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.520]   they gotta tell everybody in the world about it.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.840]   Like, hey, I have this toothpaste.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.120]   I don't care what toothpaste you're using.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.360]   This is the greatest toothpaste of all time.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.800]   You gotta change this toothpaste.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400]   They're the kind of person that spreads this restaurant.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.240]   You gotta try it.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.880]   They have the best appetizer you've ever ate before.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.760]   You gotta go to this person.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.520]   They seem to always have a guy for something.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.180]   They're like, oh man, you're looking for a mechanic?
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.020]   Look, I got somebody.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.040]   I can take care of you.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.280]   There's the best mechanic in the entire DFW area,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.720]   tri-state, you gotta go see him.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.700]   He's the best.
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.880]   See his reviews on Yelp.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.880]   They're the person who knows everything
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.720]   or they seem to have a strong opinion
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   on just about everything that it seems like.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.320]   They're really common.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.360]   Everybody, anybody know someone who's like this?
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.040]   Like, they just kinda like, they gotta tell you
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   about the different experiences that they've had
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.900]   or this new restaurant or this new hotel
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.720]   or whatever thing that they've done.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.080]   Here's why I appreciate sneezers,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   because I am totally a sneezer.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   For whatever reason, it's like hard for me to not share.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.160]   Like, when I, I'm totally the guy who's like,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.320]   dude, I have the best dentist.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.920]   I don't care who your dentist, oh, it's your dad?
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.520]   Hey, look, this guy's better than your dad.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.680]   And whatever it is, it's just easy.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.520]   It overflows.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.800]   Like, when I went on my honeymoon,
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.760]   we went to this amazing hotel
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.880]   or this amazing resort in Mexico, came back from it.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.000]   And of course, I was like, man,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I gotta tell everybody in the world.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.200]   I work with young adults who are getting married
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.640]   all the time, and there is one option in the world
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.980]   for you people that I need to make sure
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.900]   that everybody knows about, the greatest thing
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.080]   that you're ever gonna experience in terms of a honeymoon.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.920]   It's just easy.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.240]   It kinda overflows and pours out.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.200]   And if you're a sneezer in the room,
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.080]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.200]   It's just part of your personality.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Now, as easy as it is to talk about virtually anything,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.000]   there's one category that, for me,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.560]   it's not as easy to bring up,
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.100]   and it's not as easy to talk about, faith.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.520]   I mean, despite the fact that, yeah,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.560]   I'm a pastor, secret's out, when I'm outside engaging
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   with people or talking to neighbors or different things,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.160]   that unlike other arenas or other conversation starters
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.500]   or other topics, for me, when it comes to talking
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.560]   about faith, there's just something
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.680]   where it's a little bit more sensitive
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.720]   of a subject, a little bit more delicate.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.120]   It's a little harder for me to move into that conversation.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.480]   In other words, I'm not, there's natural evangelists
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.600]   out there, for me, sharing my faith is more
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.120]   like a discipline, it's something I have
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.300]   to be intentional about and mindful about.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.200]   There's natural evangelists like JP,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.080]   who every time I'm around him at a meal or dinner
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.840]   or any place that he goes, he's always sharing his faith.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.800]   He's the guy that shares it literally with everybody.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.200]   You'll bump into a coffee machine.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.440]   Coffee machine, trust Christ.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.400]   He's the guy who shares it with anybody and everybody.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200]   And for me, that's just not my story.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.880]   I have to be more intentional and more to work at it.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.000]   And here's why.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.640]   'Cause unlike when you're talking about a dentist
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.760]   or about your favorite place to shop for clothes
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.880]   or store the best deal or this website
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.560]   that you gotta check out, unlike all those different things
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.060]   where you could talk about, when it comes
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.020]   to the topic of faith, those other things are not offensive.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.760]   But there's something when you bring up the idea
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.480]   of Jesus or faith, religion, where all of a sudden,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.120]   there's just a heightened sensitivity
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.800]   that everybody else feels, where people can get offended
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.360]   or we're afraid we're going to offend someone
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.280]   in a way that those other topics typically don't.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.120]   And here's why.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.840]   Because of the bad advice we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   That we live in a world who has been saturated
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.120]   or we as Americans live in a culture that's been saturated
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.040]   with the bad advice tonight, which is don't impose
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.280]   your beliefs on people.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.200]   That you and I, you can't impose your beliefs on people.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   You shouldn't impose your beliefs on people.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.360]   You shouldn't impose your faith or religion on people.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.440]   And tonight, we're gonna explore
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.320]   why that is such bad advice.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.680]   Not only from the verses that we're gonna see,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560]   but for those of us who are Christians in the room,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.080]   it's bad advice just from the words of Jesus,
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.400]   who says, man, to not impose your beliefs,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.280]   don't hide behind the lie of that bad advice.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.880]   You are the light of the world.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.280]   You are the light of your apartment complex,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.960]   your workplace, the cubicle.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.080]   You are the light of your family, if you're a believer,
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.900]   if you're a Christian.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.160]   Tonight, we're gonna talk about Christians
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.040]   and explore why it is such bad advice, if you buy the lie,
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.200]   that you should not impose your beliefs
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.600]   on the world around you, on those who live near you,
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.360]   those who work by you.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.400]   Specifically, we're gonna see from the Apostle Paul
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.120]   why that's such bad advice and how we share our faith
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.280]   or what is the method by which we share our faith.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.000]   We're gonna be in Acts chapter 17,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.980]   where Paul lays out as clear as any other place
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.280]   through his own life and his example,
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.880]   his motivation for sharing his faith,
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   the method that he uses to share his faith,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.520]   and the mixed reactions that always happen
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.960]   anytime you share faith, 'cause this is further what I know.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.720]   80%, a recent poll came out and said,
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.040]   80% of people who are Christians,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.480]   so if you're a Christian, talking to you in the room,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.400]   say, "Hey, man, I trust you."
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.360]   80% of Christians say, "Man, I have a personal responsibility
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.480]   "before God to share my faith."
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.620]   And the same poll found that the vast majority of those
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.420]   has said that, "Not only do I believe I'm supposed to,
[00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.520]   "but I haven't any time in recent history.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.840]   "Within the last six to 12 months,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.580]   "I have not shared with anybody."
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.720]   So there's some great divide that exists for many of us,
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.440]   and that was in America, in a USA poll,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.540]   as it relates to the Christian church
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.040]   that they believe I should share, I just don't.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.400]   And tonight, we're gonna look at why that's such a tragedy
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.320]   and how we can overcome it.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.000]   We're gonna be in Acts chapter 17.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.520]   If you have a Bible foot there, Matthew, Mark, Luke, Acts.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.600]   And let me set the scene.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.840]   Acts is essentially the story of the early church.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.400]   So Jesus leaves, and the book of Acts
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.920]   is all about the apostles in kind of the early church days.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.740]   And it's the apostle Paul,
[00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.200]   who was the artist formerly known as Saul,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.580]   who spent the first half of his life
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.960]   trying to kill Christianity, stop Christianity,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.440]   meets Jesus, and spends the next half of his life
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.280]   trying to spread Christianity.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   Here's what's going on in Acts chapter 17.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.000]   Paul has been hanging out,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.240]   he's been spreading the message of Jesus
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.200]   all over the place, all over the ancient world.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.400]   He's in Athens, he's waiting for a couple friends.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.640]   He's hanging out in the city of Athens.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.860]   And that's where our story's gonna pick up.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.980]   Here's all you gotta know about Athens.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.000]   Athens was like the cultural hub of the day.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.720]   It was the religious hub of the ancient world.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.200]   It was a port city, it was a city of incredible influence.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.360]   Olympics started there, Western philosophy started there,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.480]   Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, all those guys
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.600]   that you heard about once in philosophy class years ago.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.620]   All those guys were from the city of Athens.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.880]   And Paul shows up, and what he sees inside of the city
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.760]   moves him to Acts.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.360]   So here's where we're gonna pick up the story, verse 16.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.320]   While Paul was waiting for them in Athens,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   he was greatly distressed, so he's waiting for his friends,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.960]   and he's greatly distressed to see the city
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.200]   was full of idols.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.120]   And Paul looks around inside of the city of Athens,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.880]   and all of a sudden, and the word distressed
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.800]   is like a heart-wrenching.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.280]   But he looks around and sees idols everywhere.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.300]   We know from other writings of the day
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.520]   that there were 25 to 30,000 idols inside of Athens.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.480]   It is a common saying that it's easier to find a God
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.040]   than a man in Athens.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   So Paul looks around everywhere,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   he looks and sees these different gods or false idols
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.480]   to these different things that they worshiped,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.280]   and here's what happens.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.320]   So this distressing moves him, and he does something.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.640]   So he reasoned in the synagogue with both Jews
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.000]   and God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.040]   day by day with those who happened to be there.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.480]   So Paul moves to Act.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.360]   This distressing moves him to begin having
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.240]   these different conversations with people.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   And he begins reasoning with them about their faith
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   and about what he believes in Jesus.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.520]   And all of a sudden, this debate happens.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   A group of Epicureans, which is like a class of people,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.960]   be like the Republicans or Democrats,
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.360]   or it's kind of a group that's known,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.920]   identified with this belief.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.000]   Epicureans, here's all you need to know about them.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.520]   There are people who believed there is no afterlife.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.720]   They essentially, they and Drake would get along,
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.200]   live by the motto, YOLO, eat, drink, and be merry,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.040]   'cause tomorrow we die.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.080]   So Epicureans are there, and Stoics,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   who essentially live by CrossFit,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.440]   that life is about discipline.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.920]   They begin to debate with Paul, and some of them asked,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.840]   "What is this babbler trying to say?"
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.200]   And others remarked,
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.480]   "He seems to be advocating foreign gods."
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.320]   They said this because Paul was preaching the good news
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.560]   about Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.760]   That Paul shows up, and he sees this city full of idols,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.920]   and he sees everywhere that he looks,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.120]   these different gods that they're worshiping.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.240]   And all of a sudden, because he knows the one true God,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.840]   he's moved not to begin to go picket Athens
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.680]   and be like, "We're gonna boycott this city,"
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.580]   and he's not Snapchatting,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.200]   "Can you believe these crazy people?"
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.960]   He's moved to begin to share his faith
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.520]   with those in the marketplace.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.440]   He begins to reach out and talk about Jesus
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.600]   and the resurrection.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.680]   Why would Paul feel like he has the right
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.040]   to share with these people?
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.160]   Because Paul knew, and Paul was driven by a motivation,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.800]   that it is not loving to know the truth about Jesus,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.280]   to know the truth about eternal life,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.300]   and to not share it with people.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.000]   That Paul was driven, or his motivation,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.100]   just like our motivation, is that of compassion.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.920]   The reason why Paul looks around at a city
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.000]   that's full of idol worship,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.240]   that has all kinds of different gods
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.260]   that they're worshiping, and then go,
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.040]   "Ah, yeah, teach his own, it'll be okay."
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.200]   The reason why he doesn't do that
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.640]   is because he's moved with compassion,
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.000]   that I know the one true God,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.400]   and it would be unloving for me to sit here silent
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.120]   and to not share my faith.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.480]   Paul, our first idea from the text,
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.800]   his motivation, just like ours, is compassion.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.040]   The motivation that believers have,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.800]   if you and I are ever gonna move to share faith,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.000]   or the motivation that should move us to share faith,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.120]   is that of compassion, that like Eminem said,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.080]   there's a place called heaven and a place called hell,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.520]   and everyone will spend eternity
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.920]   at one of those two places.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.260]   That everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.520]   That every person, red, yellow, black, and white,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.000]   every person you've ever interacted with,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.620]   the person who bags your groceries,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.680]   the person in the apartment complex above you,
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.780]   the person that sits next to you at work,
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.920]   every person in your family, immediate and extended,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.280]   everyone you've ever been eyeball to eyeball with
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.100]   is someone who will spend and live eternally,
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.760]   either in heaven or in hell, and this moves Paul,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.360]   'cause he knows the only way that a person
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.660]   can have eternal life and experience eternal life in heaven
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.180]   is by trusting what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.240]   in his death and resurrection.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.480]   That's not by being a good person.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.880]   Paul knows the only way that a person
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.320]   can live eternally in heaven and not eternally in hell
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.520]   is by trusting what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.080]   It would be so unloving for me to keep my mouth shut,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.940]   and it moves Paul to begin to open up his mouth and talk.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.520]   I mean, what greater motivation
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.600]   could a group or an organization have
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.720]   for their mission than the church?
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.400]   Than the fact that, like, man, every person
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.880]   that you've ever interacted with is someone
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.160]   who not only Jesus died for,
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.280]   but that will live forever with God
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.500]   or forever apart from him.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.400]   What greater motivation,
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.800]   like a lot of groups have different motivations.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.440]   Like if you're a teacher, you have a motivation,
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.160]   like, hey, get these kids educated so I can pay my bills.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.760]   If you're a person who is in sales,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.360]   you're like, man, I'm motivated to get more money.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.920]   Or maybe you're in construction,
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.240]   you're motivated to complete a job.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.760]   The Apostle Paul shows us the greatest motivation
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.680]   is that of the one that everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.080]   And so how can I not share?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.160]   I was in Africa a number of years ago,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.000]   and I spent essentially a summer in Africa.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.920]   And while we were there,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.040]   we were in this like East Ugandan village.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.860]   It was super remote.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.660]   Like we are no electricity, no water in this village
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.460]   doing some kind of orphanage stuff.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.400]   And like, I mean, deep, we're in the bush.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.240]   You know where the bush is?
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.060]   We're there.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.580]   And so we're super remote,
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.620]   and we're hanging out with the villages,
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.760]   and we're there for about a month.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.340]   And while we're there, one of the villagers said,
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.740]   hey, I wanna have you guys come over
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.740]   and essentially have something to eat and drink with us.
[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.660]   We go into this guy's house, get there,
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.460]   walk in the door, he hands me an ice cold Coke, Coca-Cola.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.620]   And I'm like, dude, how could this possibly
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.460]   be here right now?
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.020]   Like it is a cold Coke.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.060]   There's no refrigerators anywhere around here.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.640]   What sort of magic trick has this man played?
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.100]   Where could this possibly have come from?
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.940]   Here's how it got there.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.180]   The guy had boughten or bought it, boughten,
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.900]   it from a, (laughs)
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.020]   I need you educators.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.820]   You guys didn't do your job, teachers.
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.700]   (audience laughs)
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.540]   The guy had bought it.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.020]   There was someone in the village who every single day
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.140]   would sell these Coca-Colas.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.300]   How did he get the Coca-Colas
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.700]   to begin to sell to the villagers?
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.580]   He would go on his bike and he would ride his bike
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.500]   and he would meet with a cooler.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.220]   He would go pick up at this truck that would show up
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.220]   and go around to these different remote villages
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.740]   and he would hand off Coca-Cola.
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.580]   The guy would take the Coca-Cola on his bike.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.640]   He would go around, he would sell.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.060]   That's how he made a living.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.340]   Now, so that's how we got the Coca-Cola there.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.540]   Now let me ask you this.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:20.700]   What motivated Coca-Cola to get the product
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.460]   into the hands of East remote, random people
[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.300]   all over the planet?
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.740]   People who will never even experience electricity
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.020]   but they have Coca-Cola.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.700]   What could have possibly led to the sequence of events
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.940]   that ended up with Coca-Cola being in this village?
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.540]   Here's what I mean.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.220]   Was it the fact that somewhere some guy who made Coca-Cola
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.900]   was like, "This is an incredible product.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.460]   "It's life-changing.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.740]   "The nutritional value here is incredible.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.200]   "We gotta get it in the hands of every African out there,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.340]   "every person on the planet.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.180]   "We gotta get it there."
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.420]   No, it's not the right Coke.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.360]   It's like, "We gotta get it everywhere
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.200]   "'cause it's a great product."
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.900]   It's terrible for you nutritionally.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.100]   And you could leave a nail in there for a few days
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:55.940]   and it'll disintegrate.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.420]   That can't be good, whatever that means.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.700]   So it's not because of that reason.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.300]   It's for one reason and one reason only, which is what?
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.860]   Money.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.780]   That in some C-suite somewhere, there's some CEO
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.540]   in some high-rise on the eighth floor going,
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.540]   "We gotta get Coca-Cola in more places
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.360]   "and more spaces into the hands of more people
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.200]   "all over the planet.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   "We're gonna fill the Great Commission of Coca-Cola.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.460]   "Every country in the entire world will have Coca-Cola."
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:19.300]   Why?
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.500]   For one reason, money.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:26.100]   Little pieces of green paper with dead presidents on it.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.180]   And this thing drives, and Coca-Cola, man,
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.700]   they have fulfilled almost their Great Commission.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.140]   It's on every country on the planet
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.140]   except for Saudi Arabia and North Korea.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.220]   All because of one motivation, money.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.220]   How much greater is the Christian message?
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.980]   And Paul looks in the eyes of these Athenians,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.500]   and the reason he's even in Athens
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.460]   is because he believes there is a God who's out there.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.860]   Every person that I'm surrounded by
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.380]   will live eternally somewhere,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.140]   either in heaven with the God who created them,
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.660]   love them, die for them on a cross,
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.980]   or eternally apart from him.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.060]   And he is reaching out through the body of Christ,
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.380]   and I am moved with compassion.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.820]   It's unloving for you to stay silent
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:06.620]   while those around you wonder about the God who's out there.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.900]   It's unloving to keep your mouth shut.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.980]   And we live in a world that's like,
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.100]   man, it's so judgmental,
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.260]   and it's not loving for you to talk about your faith.
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.140]   Paul would say the opposite is true.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.060]   And man, when I read the story of Paul,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.300]   it's so convicting,
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.080]   because man, this was so real for him.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.740]   He believed it, and it impacted him at such a core level.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.020]   His motivation, it drove him all over the ancient world,
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.020]   sharing his faith, unique, even among the disciples.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.700]   All the apostles, even when you look at ancient history,
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.860]   you study the church, there's something about Paul.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.260]   He stands out, even different from Peter, James, and John.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.820]   When you read the story, you read the book of Acts,
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.380]   you can see the first few decades of the church,
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.900]   and you see just the places that these different guys went.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.580]   You see where Peter, James, and John,
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.180]   and where they took the mission.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.900]   All of them, for the first couple decades,
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.980]   pretty much for the most part, just hang out in Jerusalem,
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.420]   versus Paul, who goes all over the place,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.400]   taking the message everywhere that he goes,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.300]   all over the ancient world and Europe.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.740]   Almost as though there was some meeting that took place
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.780]   with all the apostles together that we missed,
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.180]   where they got together, all 12 in a room.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.380]   Paul's standing there, he puts up a big map on the wall,
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.300]   and he's like, all right, you guys got the whole world here.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.760]   You guys take Jerusalem, I'll take everything else.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.780]   Good?
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.180]   Like there was something where Paul just,
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.500]   it grabbed hold of him.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.340]   And while everyone else kinda hung around
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.100]   for the first couple decades, instead of Jerusalem,
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.620]   Paul went everywhere, saying this is for every person,
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.340]   because every person lives forever somewhere,
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.960]   and I have a motivation of compassion
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.420]   that they would know the risen Christ
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.140]   and the resurrection and Jesus.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.180]   So Paul shares this, and this creates kind of a stir
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.420]   in Athens, and so they take him before
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.940]   the elite of elite group.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.420]   They begin to say, man, all right,
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.540]   hey, we've heard your message,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.700]   we wanna make sure that they hear it.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   So here's what happens next, verse 19.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.580]   Then they took him, and they brought him
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.420]   to the meeting of the Areopagus.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.860]   Areopagus is a word that means the hill of Ares,
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.200]   or Mars Hill, you may have heard it called before.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.820]   It's essentially this hill that these 30 men
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.140]   who made up kind of the Supreme Court of the day of Athens,
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.380]   these were the high-power individuals,
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.460]   and they're kinda over the city of Athens,
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.460]   and they decide what religions can be tolerated here
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.180]   and what's gonna happen and what can take place,
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.980]   and there's these 30 men who are the governing body.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.660]   So Paul comes before them.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.420]   Interestingly enough, this is the group that Socrates,
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.780]   if you know who that guy is, Socrates went before,
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.380]   and for proclaiming foreign deities,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.140]   Socrates was sentenced to death.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.200]   So Paul goes before these guys, and he's standing
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.160]   in what very likely could be a group
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.320]   that wants to have him killed,
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.760]   wants to have something happen,
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.120]   and he doesn't shy away at all,
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.920]   'cause Paul is straight thug life,
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.640]   and he goes right into sharing the gospel.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   Here's what happens.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.000]   He brought them before the Areopagus, and they say,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.420]   "We want to know these new teachings
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.480]   "that you are presenting.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.900]   "You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears,
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.040]   "and we would like to know what they mean."
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.540]   All the Athenians and the foreigners who live there
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.400]   spent their time doing nothing but talking about
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.720]   and listening to the latest ideas.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.240]   So they said, basically, "Hey, we want to hear
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.780]   "what you're bringing, what you're talking about,
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.640]   "and these foreign ideas."
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.320]   So then Paul launches into his TED Talk, if you will,
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.440]   and takes the opportunity to share about his faith.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.280]   Here's what happens.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.320]   He stands up at the meeting in the Areopagus and said,
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.660]   "People of Athens, I see that in every way
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.860]   "you are very religious.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.960]   "For as I walked around and looked carefully
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.080]   "at your objects of worship,
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.860]   "I even found an altar with this inscription.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.080]   "To an unknown God."
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.800]   The unknown God, so basically what Paul just said is,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.200]   "Hey, I walked around the whole city.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.000]   "You got a sun god, a moon god, a stars god,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.100]   "you got a sewage god, you got every kind of god out there,
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.080]   "and then you have this one inscription that says,"
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.360]   true story, they have a sewage god,
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.820]   "and they have this one inscription that says,
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.020]   "To an unknown God."
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.680]   And Paul realizes what, of course, you would see
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   is that they had this uncertainty that, man,
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.360]   we have all these different gods, but maybe we missed one.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.240]   Maybe we missed one.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.560]   In case, like, there's some god we forgot to honor
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.940]   or worship, and maybe he's gonna show up someday
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.960]   and be like, "Hey, I'm Bob.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.800]   "Hey, where's my idol?
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.640]   "Where's the statue?
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.460]   "There's nothing."
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.300]   And they're gonna go, "Oh, Bob, you're here.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.240]   "We just didn't know your name.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.280]   "This idol to the unknown God, this is for you.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.780]   "This is you, we knew you were there.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.000]   "We just didn't know your name."
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.080]   And Paul recognizes that you guys have all
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.920]   of these different expressions of worship,
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.900]   but you don't have any certainty.
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.360]   You admit at the end of the day,
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   idol to the unknown God, you're guessing.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.760]   You don't know the gods that are there and not there,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.400]   and so you kind of are covering your bases
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.260]   by having this one, and he says,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.200]   "I know the name of the unknown God.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.520]   "I know the God that is there."
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.560]   And he launches again into this topic.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.140]   Continues, "So you are ignorant of the very thing
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.560]   "that you worship, which I'm gonna proclaim to you.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.940]   "The God who made the world and everything in it
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.800]   "is Lord of heaven and earth."
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.680]   So the God who is there, there's not a lot of gods.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.520]   There's one God.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:11.200]   And he does not live in temples made by human hands.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.020]   There's temples everywhere, and he's going,
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.720]   there's one God, and he doesn't live in that building
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.840]   or in that building.
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   And he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.680]   Rather, he himself gives everyone breath
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.020]   and everything else.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.960]   "From one man, he made all the nations
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.280]   "that they should inhabit the whole earth,
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.360]   "and he marked out their appointed times and history
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.760]   "and the boundaries of their land."
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.280]   So not only is God great, God is intimately involved
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.400]   in the places and times in which humanity lives.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.420]   Side note, God is intimately involved in where you live,
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.140]   the family you live in, the time in which you live.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.380]   Like, it is not an accident that you live in 2017.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.180]   You may be like, "No, my parents told me I'm an accident."
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.900]   You are not an accident to God
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   that he knows everything about.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.180]   He placed you exactly where you was,
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.260]   and he did it for a purpose.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.980]   I love this verse.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.900]   Why did God place people in the times
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.200]   and places where they are?
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.580]   God did this so that they would seek him
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.540]   and perhaps reach out for him and find him,
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.560]   though he's not far from any of us,
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.220]   that God placed people when and where he did
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.480]   so that in hopes that the place that they live
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.320]   and the time that they live,
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.680]   they would reach out and find God,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.000]   and they would find, as Paul's about to tell us,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.700]   that he's a God who's reaching back out towards them.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:35.000]   And he quotes some of their own poets.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.840]   I love this.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.300]   For in him we live and move and have our being,
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.940]   as some of your own poets have said.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.900]   We are his offspring.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.940]   Therefore, since we are God's offspring,
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.300]   we should not think that the divine being
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.900]   is like gold or silver or stone
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.420]   or an image made by human design and skill.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.700]   Like, in other words, hey, even your own poets,
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.840]   he quotes their own poetry, like Greek poets,
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.980]   people they would have known.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.140]   He doesn't quote Deuteronomy.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.660]   It'd be like quoting Jay-Z.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.500]   It'd be like quoting Eminem,
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.680]   and that's exactly what it'd be like.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.360]   He quotes these two Greek poets that would have known.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.320]   He's like, look, even your own poets acknowledge
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.400]   the gods who are there are a whole lot bigger
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.800]   than these different little statues.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.880]   In him we live and move and have our being.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.320]   We're his offspring.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.160]   If we're the offspring of God,
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.400]   we shouldn't think that we could create God.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.800]   Even your own poets say that, hey, God created us.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.200]   Therefore, we can't just make a little statue,
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.020]   and that's God.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.280]   That's silly, and Paul just reasons with them
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.480]   and connects them or connects to them,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.040]   and the beliefs and the things that they believe.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.040]   He continues, in the past, God has overlooked such ignorance,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.560]   but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.200]   The word repent is a little Greek word for change your mind.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.080]   There's different times throughout Scripture
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.360]   where depending on the context, it means, hey,
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   turn from these actions that you're doing,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.420]   and other times in Scripture where based on the context,
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.720]   it's just a word for, hey, change the way
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.120]   you're thinking about it.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.680]   Paul, in this context, is not saying,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.200]   hey, you need to correct your behavior.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.640]   He's saying you need to change the way you think about God,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.520]   that God commands all people everywhere,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.480]   that there isn't Zeus and Mars or Ares
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   and all these different gods.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.200]   There is one God who created the world
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   and formed everything in it, and he commands all people
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.720]   to change the way that they think about him,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.880]   change the way that they think, many of them,
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.520]   who think that God is demanding something from him,
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.840]   that God who's there is not served by human hands,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.240]   but he loves to serve, and he did so by coming
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.080]   in the form of Jesus and dying on a cross.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.640]   Here's what he says, commands all people,
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.300]   for he has set a day he will judge the world with justice
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.080]   by the man, that's Jesus.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.200]   He is appointed, and he has given proof of this
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   by raising him from the dead,
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.360]   that Paul says God commands everyone everywhere
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.900]   to change the way that they think about the God
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.480]   who is there, who's not demanding something from them.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.080]   He's not served by human hands,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.560]   but he's done something for them,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   and he died and rose from the dead in their place.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.120]   Paul lays out really in doing so,
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.720]   gives us a perfect model of the method
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.560]   by which we share our faith.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.180]   So our motivation is compassion.
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.760]   That's why don't impose your beliefs is horrific advice.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.280]   And the method by which we share our faith, Paul lays out.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.100]   What's the method?
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.160]   Our method is that we connect and confront.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.520]   The method by which we share our faith,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.280]   just like Paul did, is you connect to those
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.700]   who you're talking with or sharing your faith with,
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.760]   speaking with, and then you confront them with Christ.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.600]   You don't confront them with,
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.760]   "Why, man, you should change your sexual behavior.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.400]   "You should stop smoking that."
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.300]   You confront them with Jesus.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   Jesus alone is enough of a stumbling block.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.240]   You point them to Christ, and everything else will change,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.520]   or everything hinges on that.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.080]   You connect first, and then you confront.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.840]   Paul's method is, hey, connect first, confront.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   How did Paul connect?
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.960]   Like, he starts out, like, think about this.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.040]   He doesn't condemn their idol worship
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.960]   and be like, "What are you guys doing?
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.980]   "A sewage God?
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.200]   "That's pathetic."
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.960]   He looks at them and compliments them.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.640]   "Hey, man, I see you guys are religious.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.640]   "Like, you're trying to figure this out.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.240]   "And I also see there's an unknown God,
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.660]   "and he seeks to connect.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.200]   "There's an arena you're not certain on."
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   Not only does he do that, I mean,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.160]   think about the fact that he even quotes
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.000]   from their own poetry.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.840]   At some point, Paul cared enough about these Greek men
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.960]   and women to read their literature, study it,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.160]   and use that as a springboard into a conversation
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.840]   that you seek first to connect and then move to Christ.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.240]   The way that our method for sharing
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.160]   is we seek first to connect and then to confront.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.000]   What does this look like for us?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.720]   It just looks like asking questions
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.240]   in the midst of trying to share our faith.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.360]   It's just like, man, hey, what's your name?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.200]   Where are you from?
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.280]   How long have you worked here?
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.320]   What are you up to this weekend?
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.600]   Man, are you dating someone?
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.440]   How's that going?
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.260]   What's his name?
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.120]   And we just seek any way that we can connect
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.480]   with real life, caring for people,
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.240]   and use that as a springboard
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.680]   into a conversation about Jesus.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.280]   I mean, there's just different ways, man,
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.120]   especially around here where it has been so healthy for me.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.100]   I love this place 'cause if you hang around here long enough,
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.560]   you will learn different ways to jump into the conversation
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.040]   about sharing your faith,
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.880]   whether it's like allowing someone's name
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.480]   to be a springboard, like, oh, man, your name is Sarah.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.520]   Awesome, Sarah.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.420]   Hey, do you know where your name comes from?
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.360]   It comes from the story of a woman in the Bible
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.560]   who was married to Abraham.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.520]   I actually worship the same God as Abraham and Sarah,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.660]   the person who your name is from.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.980]   Would you like to worship her?
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.760]   Him, him.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.480]   I mean, it's just different ways
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.680]   where you can springboard into it
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.160]   in any direction that you go.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.200]   Hey, this weekend or last weekend
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.060]   or whatever weekend is Easter,
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.900]   do you know what your plans are?
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.740]   What are you doing on Easter?
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.160]   What do you believe happened at Easter?
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.320]   We just look for a way to connect.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.400]   We look to, man, it's really stressful
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.120]   and someone's sharing about just the anxiety
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.040]   that they have about their job.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.020]   Gosh, I get anxious sometimes, too.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.980]   Do you know what helps me when I'm anxious?
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.000]   And we just try to springboard into our faith.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.960]   We connect with people wherever they are
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.440]   and then we confront and we confront them with Christ
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.520]   and let the message of Jesus and that alone
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.480]   be the turning point inside of life,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.520]   just like Paul did where he says,
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.960]   look, I'm gonna share, I'm gonna connect with you
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.520]   and I'm not gonna shy away from speaking
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.400]   about the resurrection and the one Savior
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.560]   of the entire world.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.900]   Same thing for you and I.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.080]   I got to experience this a couple days ago
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.600]   where I came home from work, getting sick, apologize,
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.680]   and there was AT&T was in my driveway.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.200]   There was a guy who was going door to door
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.520]   to sell AT&T services and pull up
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   and we don't have AT&T and don't want AT&T
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.000]   and roll down the window and I'm like,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.160]   what's going on, man?
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.200]   Hey, do you want to, you wanted to talk about AT&T.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.520]   We're actually okay, we're good, thank you so much,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.280]   but God bless you, man, it's hot out here.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.760]   And then I begin to pull the car up
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.200]   and he says, hey, hey, hey, it is hot, man,
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:53.480]   you got any water?
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.240]   And I look in the car and then he goes, I can wait.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.040]   And I was like, great, all right, well, I'll pull the car in.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.440]   So I pull the car in, I go in, grab water,
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.080]   I come outside and give him water and say,
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:05.920]   hey, what's your name?
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.320]   He said, Yusuf.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.720]   And I said, Yusuf, huh, where's that come from?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.760]   He said, oh, it comes from the name Joseph.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.920]   Hey, you laughed at the name thing, but this, it works.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.760]   Joseph, no way, man.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.840]   Okay, are you someone who is familiar
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.920]   with the story of Joseph?
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.560]   Are you a follower of Christ?
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.760]   And we were into the conversation.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.280]   And he began to say, no, I'm not,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.840]   I kind of was raised in church,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.080]   but honestly, man, I've done a lot of bad things
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.040]   and I can't say that I'm a Christian anymore.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.360]   And I don't think that the God who's there would accept me.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.520]   I've done a lot of bad stuff
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.400]   and I feel like I'm doing a lot of bad stuff.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.040]   And I said, Yusuf, I don't know your story,
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.240]   I don't know what you're doing.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   Here's what I know.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.360]   The message of Christianity is not,
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.520]   as long as you're not a bad person, God will accept you.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.920]   In fact, the message of Christianity is that
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.640]   the only ones who God will accept
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.200]   are those who acknowledge I'm not a good person.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.900]   I'm not a good enough person to save myself.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.200]   As good as I think I am, I'm sinful.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.840]   And if I'm ever gonna experience a relationship with God,
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.720]   it's gonna be by grace through faith
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.800]   or by trusting what Jesus did on the cross,
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:18.980]   paying for my sins.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.520]   Dying in my place and rising from the grave.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.880]   Not by me trying to earn my way to God
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.840]   by being a good person.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.000]   So I don't know what your story is,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.360]   I don't know what you're involved in,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   but I know whatever it is, it won't keep you out of heaven
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.400]   if you trust in the one thing that will get you in,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.460]   which is Jesus.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.320]   And we began to dialogue and I said,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.600]   have you ever heard that before?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.800]   You know, you said you were raised in church.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.120]   He said, no.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.100]   And at some point, we were just talking about Watermark
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.140]   and him coming here and he was like, man, I'm intrigued.
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.700]   I've never heard that message before.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.940]   That is, I wanna come.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:56.980]   And he said, does your church,
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.460]   like do they program you to talk like this?
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.220]   Or tell me this, why did you share?
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.060]   And what Yusuf needed to know
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.300]   is not that there's a God or a church that programs you,
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.820]   there's a God who programmed the world
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.860]   to work in a certain way.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.140]   And it's God who's programmed every human heart
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.860]   to the reality that it will not find satisfaction,
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.900]   it will not find life apart from a relationship
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.540]   with that God who programmed it, who created the world,
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.220]   who created them to live in existence with him.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.500]   And what I looked and said to Yusuf is, no,
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.660]   no, there wasn't a program.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.900]   What moved me to share, here's what I believe, Yusuf,
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.080]   I think the God of this world loves you so much
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.540]   that he brought you to this house right now
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.300]   and he made you thirsty so that you would want water,
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.340]   so that would bridge into a conversation
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.140]   about the God who hasn't given up on you,
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.360]   hasn't forgotten you, and who loves you enough
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.740]   to die in your place, if you'll accept it,
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.260]   you'll experience eternity with him forever and ever and ever.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.100]   And he looked and he said, this is how I could tell
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.180]   he'd been raised in church before, he goes,
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:00.900]   man, you have given me much more than water.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.620]   You have given me living water.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.140]   (laughing)
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.180]   I was like, man, you have definitely been
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.380]   in Sunday school at some point.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.100]   John chapter four is where that came from.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.940]   And he said, I'm gonna call you,
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.060]   I'm gonna come next Sunday.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.080]   And so who knows?
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.060]   But in sharing our faith, man, we seek to just connect.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.260]   Sometimes it involves like meeting a physical need
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.900]   before being able to share on a physical need,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.740]   but we seek to connect and then we confront
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.660]   just with Christ, we point people to Christ.
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.480]   Not our behavior, their behavior, any of those things,
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.300]   we confront them with Christ, connect,
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.040]   and then confront them with Christ.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.100]   Paul then goes into what happens when he shares this message
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.820]   with these Athenians and what takes place in their response.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.180]   Verse 32, when they heard the good news about Jesus,
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.020]   they fell on their knees and said,
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.420]   I believe in Jesus, he will save me forever.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.940]   No, that's not there at all.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.940]   You guys are not reading along with me.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.980]   That's what we would think, or that's a lot of times
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.340]   what we think it would say.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.340]   It's not what it says at all.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.340]   Look what happens.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.300]   In other words, it's not something like,
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.700]   oh man, you share and all of a sudden,
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.620]   everybody for sure, every time gets saved.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.900]   When they heard about the resurrection of the dead,
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.940]   some sneered.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.780]   (exhaling)
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.660]   Oh God, resurrection, okay.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.740]   Some become critical.
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.340]   Others said, we wanna hear you again on this subject.
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.320]   But some were curious, like Yusuf.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:26.340]   And at that, Paul left the council and some people
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.060]   became followers of Paul and believed.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.140]   Among them was Dionysus, a member of the Areopagus,
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:36.380]   one of the 30, and also a woman named Damaris
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.380]   and a number of others that Paul shared.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.860]   There were some who were critical,
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.260]   some who became curious.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.460]   I just wanna hear more.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.260]   And then some converted.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.700]   That anytime that you and I share the message,
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.700]   our third idea from the text,
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.200]   so we have the motivation for sharing,
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.180]   the method by which we share,
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.380]   which is connect and confront to Christ,
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.700]   and then the mixed reactions that our message creates.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.580]   We have a message that creates the message of Jesus.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.780]   It just creates mixed reactions, just like in Paul's.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.620]   If you ever share your faith,
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.460]   you go outside of this room,
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.100]   you're gonna share with different people in your family,
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.980]   different people you work with,
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.100]   different people you interact with.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:05.940]   If you share your faith,
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:06.940]   you're gonna fall into three categories.
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.260]   The response that people have to the name of Jesus.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.820]   They either are critical,
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.140]   I don't need that, I don't believe that,
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.180]   I'm spiritual, man, I got my own way.
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.820]   They reject it, they're curious,
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.580]   wow, you actually believe this.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.860]   I don't think I've ever met a Christian
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.940]   who actually believes this.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.420]   And they wanna hear more.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.340]   They're critical, curious,
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.780]   and sometimes they convert.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.580]   They trust in Jesus.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.560]   That whenever we share the message of Jesus,
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.140]   there's mixed reactions that take place.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.020]   That there's people who, man,
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:37.860]   when you share your faith,
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.140]   they're just, Jesus said,
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.460]   I came, Matthew chapter 10,
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.020]   that I came to bring division.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.740]   That you should expect when you share your faith,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.180]   some people are gonna hate you for it.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.940]   They hated me first.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.820]   Other people are, like Yusuf, gonna be curious.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.340]   And then sometimes, rarely,
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.940]   man, they're gonna on the spot say, I trust in Jesus.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.020]   Which for the most part, for a lot of us,
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.180]   at least from my experience,
[00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.120]   is very much the outlier.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:02.960]   Outside of these doors,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.160]   outside of church and ministry and mission trips,
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.920]   when you're just interacting with people out in public
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.400]   or strangers, when you share your faith,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.240]   very rarely, at one time in the last eight years,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.080]   has someone ever been like,
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.840]   man, I wanna trust Christ right now in this moment.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.800]   But we're just planting seeds.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.440]   Here's why this is important for you to know.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.800]   Because as you share your faith,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.440]   as any of us, if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.600]   which you have a responsibility, according to Jesus, to do,
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.760]   as you share your faith,
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.400]   the measure of success is not
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.340]   which category did they fall into.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.520]   The measure of success is sharing.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.000]   In other words, I think for a lot of us,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.920]   we were coming in the night and I said,
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.160]   hey, what is a successful,
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.600]   what would be success when it comes to sharing your faith?
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.440]   Like at the end of the day, like,
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.080]   hey, that was a win, put a W up on the board.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.120]   Like, what would be a success?
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.840]   If everyone got an answer inside of their head of,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.400]   oh man, what is successful
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   when it comes to sharing your faith?
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.040]   I think a lot of us would go,
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.340]   if they like pray the prayer and trust Jesus right there,
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.740]   and Paul would say, no.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.860]   It's not your job to save or my job to save.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.480]   Success comes in sharing.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.360]   Whatever the response,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.320]   that a successful success
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.880]   as it relates to sharing your faith in my faith
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.100]   is simply in sharing the message of Jesus.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.400]   And let God do what only God can do,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.240]   which is save people like Dionysus,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.960]   or create curiosity inside of the hearts of people
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.880]   and move them.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.920]   Our job is not to save, it's simply to share.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.120]   And Paul says, look, of course I'm gonna share my faith
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.320]   and I'm gonna let God determine the outcome.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   For most of us,
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:43.340]   man, and I have deep sympathy for this,
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.920]   but I think the reason why we don't share our faith
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.920]   is for one reason or one word.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.760]   You know what it is?
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.280]   Awkward.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.560]   We're like, oh gosh, it's just,
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.600]   I don't know if I can do it.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.340]   It's just gonna create a little awkward tension
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.180]   in the moment.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.920]   It's gonna be awkward inside of that conversation
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.760]   and what are they gonna think?
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.960]   If they're gonna think of some weirdo
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.280]   and just gonna make it weird around the office,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.720]   or it's gonna be awkward with this person,
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.880]   or maybe they're gonna feel uncomfortable.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.120]   I don't wanna make them feel uncomfortable
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.280]   and it's just too awkward.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.880]   I don't wanna feel uncomfortable.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.840]   And can you imagine having that conversation
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.940]   with the apostle Paul?
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.800]   Like, wait a second,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.480]   the reason you're not sharing your faith?
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.720]   I mean, Paul, who like suffered.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.880]   In 2 Timothy chapter two, he says,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.480]   "Look, I will suffer anything
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.260]   "to spread the message of Christianity.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.680]   "Whatever it takes, whatever it costs,
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.520]   "whatever they do to me,
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.960]   "I will suffer whatever it is
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.000]   "in order to move forward the message of Christianity
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.100]   "because everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.680]   "I need to get the message out to people
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.880]   "that there's a God who loves them.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.440]   "He's not asking them to do something.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.600]   "He died for them in their place.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.200]   "And if they'll trust in him,
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.640]   "they'll have eternal life."
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.040]   And he says, "Whatever it takes, I'll suffer anything."
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.800]   2 Timothy chapter two tells us.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.680]   And when you go, man, what did Paul actually suffer?
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.920]   They're like, what was he really willing?
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.640]   You read the story and you see,
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.640]   Paul in 2 Corinthians talks about some of the things
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.700]   that he suffered and he says,
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.160]   "I was whipped with a cat of nine tails."
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.920]   It was essentially a whip with metal spikes on the end.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.080]   Five different times.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.360]   Each of the different times, it was 39 lashes.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.180]   That's how many times.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.360]   So on five different occasions,
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.480]   I was whipped with these metal spikes on the end.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.840]   Someone who was whipped with a cat of nine tails
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.080]   often was so permanently disfigured
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:24.280]   that you couldn't even tell where the back would begin.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.440]   Paul, many people didn't live.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.200]   Five different occasions he was whipped.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.800]   Three chapters earlier, he's sharing the message of Jesus.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.080]   The crowd gets angry at him
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.680]   and they begin to pelt him with rocks or stone him.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.580]   Not like stone, like, yeah, but like stone him with rocks.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:41.760]   To the point where they think he's dead
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   and they drag him outside his city.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.860]   And miraculously, at some point he wakes up.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.680]   Three different times he says, "I was shipwrecked."
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.880]   I mean, which is amazing.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.260]   He just kept getting on the boat.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.740]   He's like, "I don't care what it takes.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.740]   "I'm gonna get on that thing."
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.420]   Versus like, "Let me just take the camel."
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.160]   And he's like, "Whatever it takes, I'm gonna go.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.000]   "I'm gonna spread the message.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.780]   "Whatever it costs me, I'm willing to suffer anything
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.980]   "for the sake of God's people to get the message everywhere
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.180]   "because everyone lives forever somewhere."
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.060]   It's like embarrassing as Americans.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.860]   When you think of like if the apostle Paul was here
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.060]   and he was like, "Guys, how's it going?
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.500]   "You sharing your faith?"
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.100]   No, it's just, yeah, tell me about it.
[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.200]   What are they, are they throwing you to lions?
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.400]   Are they throwing you in the dungeon?
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.440]   They trying to cut your head off?
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.280]   They whipping you?
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.100]   Is that what's going?
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.880]   No, man, are they taking your family?
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.720]   Are they taking things from you?
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   No, it's just, it's just awkward.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.640]   [congregation laughing]
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   You'd be like, "What?
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.800]   "What does that even, what is that, modern form of torture
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.640]   "that they've created?
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.040]   "Like we wouldn't even have a category for it."
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.780]   And yet, maybe because, man, we live in like the land
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.760]   of the free, our pain tolerance is so low.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.420]   Some of us, the most godly thing we can do tonight
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.700]   is say, "God, will you kill my fear of it being awkward?
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.200]   "Will you kill the part of my heart that's afraid,
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.580]   "that's not compassionate and not motivated
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.980]   "by compassion towards people?
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.460]   "Will you help me to seek to connect and care
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.620]   "and confront people, not with my opinion
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.880]   "and my political ideas, but with the gospel,
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.380]   "with Christ alone?
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.400]   "And will you help me in the face of mixed reactions
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.460]   "to not lose heart, to see it as success,
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.340]   "to allow you to stretch out your hand and save,
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.500]   "and to see it as a success by just sharing
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.700]   "the message of eternal life?"
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.780]   There's only one way that they can experience that.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.620]   Will you help me, Lord?
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.040]   And the most godly thing I think for most of us,
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   'cause if any of the polls are accurate,
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.140]   then 80% of us would say we agree,
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.340]   the Christians in the room, and then the vast majority
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.300]   would say, "Yeah, we just don't do it."
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.580]   And so asking the God of angel armies,
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:51.620]   come win in this heart, come move this heart
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.380]   with compassion towards those around me
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.380]   who will never know the message of Christ
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.140]   apart from someone sharing it with them.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:03.260]   In conclusion, our motivation is compassion.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.780]   Our method is to connect and to confront with Christ,
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.160]   and our message creates mixed reactions.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.920]   We have this expression in culture
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.440]   that essentially is like,
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.700]   "Hey, that's not a hill I would die on."
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.940]   And it's things like we hold loosely,
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.940]   that, "Hey, I think that the warriors
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:27.280]   "are better than whatever,
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.120]   "but it's not a hill I would die on.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.620]   "I think that Pepsi's better than Coke,
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.240]   "but not a hill I would die on."
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.180]   I think for many of us, that's how your Christian faith is.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.500]   That you're like, "Yes, I love Jesus, and sure,
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.960]   "I think if you're asking me to share,
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.760]   "and I like church and all this stuff,
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.500]   "but it's not a hill I would die on.
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.960]   "I'm not gonna do it if it costs me anything.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.240]   "I'm not gonna do it if it costs me relationships
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.520]   "or friends or kind of makes me uncomfortable
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.300]   "or I could lose my job over it.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.640]   "It's not something, it's not really a hill
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:55.860]   "that I would die on."
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:01.400]   And the Apostle Paul, 2,000 years ago,
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.120]   walks up Mars Hill, a hill,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.720]   and he looks into the eyes of 30 men
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.840]   who literally hold his life in the balance.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.920]   They, very shortly or a few hundred years before,
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.840]   had put to death Socrates for believing
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.720]   the exact same thing, proclaiming foreign deities,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.200]   the exact same words.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.780]   And he looks these men in the eyes and says,
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.400]   "Look, this is a hill I will die on.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.780]   "Not just Mars Hill and Aries Hill,
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.420]   "but the hill of the reality and the truth
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.060]   "that Jesus is the only way.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.460]   "There is one God out there.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.100]   "All of these other gods will fall.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.700]   "2,000 years from now, every Zeus, every idol,
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.740]   "every statue will not be here.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.400]   "There will be one God that is worshiped all over
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.820]   "this land, all over the West.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.840]   "It will spread like wildfire."
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.480]   The message of Christianity,
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.920]   the message of the God who was there,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.080]   who is love, who sent his son into the world
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:47.920]   to die in your place.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.420]   "It is a hill I will die on.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.160]   "You can kill me, but this is something
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.760]   "I will not let go without being said.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.640]   "And I'm willing to die on this hill."
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.000]   And for those of us in the room who are like,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.880]   "Man, I don't know if I would share my faith.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.320]   "It's just not really a hill I would die on."
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.400]   I want you to know the hill that Jesus died on,
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.260]   a hill called Golgotha.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.280]   Why did he do it?
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.080]   Because just like even the message and motivation of Paul
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.600]   that, "Hey, I love these people so much.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.620]   "I want them to know that God that is there
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.380]   "does not have to be unknown,
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:23.900]   "that the God who is there is reaching out to them
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.480]   "and wants them to know,
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.680]   "wants them to know that he's done something for them
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.940]   "if they would just accept what he did on the cross
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.800]   "in their place and it moved him to die on a hill."
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.880]   It was a hill he would die on called Golgotha.
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.880]   It's a hill that Paul stood before this Athenian group
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.700]   and said, "It's the only hill worth dying on.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.600]   "It's the only hill that will last for all eternity.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.400]   "All of these gods will fall."
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.960]   And today, the one true God is reaching out
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.320]   through the hands and feet of Christ, which Paul was,
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.040]   and you are if you're a Christian,
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.380]   to say, "This is the message of eternal life.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.400]   "There is no other.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.100]   "And this is the God who is there.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.320]   "There is no other."
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   Can I tell you about him?
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.240]   He wants to be known and I wanna tell you about him.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.080]   Let me pray.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:21.260]   Father, we need your help.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:30.600]   We live in a world that every day sends the message
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   that you can talk about everything but religion and politics
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.200]   but we live in a world where it's so quick
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:40.040]   to either get offensive or tense or any of those things
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.360]   when you bring up the conversation,
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.520]   specifically the name of the one Savior, Jesus.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:49.760]   So would you move in the hearts of your people,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.120]   starting with me, and inspire courageous faith?
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.020]   Would you move us to act?
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.920]   Would you make us winsome engagers
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:58.600]   as we move in conversation?
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.720]   I pray for my friends in the room
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.300]   who have never shared their faith before ever.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.060]   That you would allow whatever barriers exist there,
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.780]   whatever personal wirings, introversion,
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.620]   whatever it is that holds them back
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.060]   from wanting to say something,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.460]   whatever fear of making something uncomfortable,
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.540]   fear of the person having questions they can't answer,
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.020]   whatever those obstacles would you win,
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.940]   take them down in the way that you took them down
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.540]   in the heart of Saul, who you converted to Paul,
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.060]   who changed the world.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.060]   Father, we thank you for your love.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.460]   Father, we thank you that we worship the one true God
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.660]   who that in a thousand years
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.520]   will still be enthroned and worshiped,
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.360]   either in this life or in the next, should you return.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.620]   Would you win inside of this city?
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.940]   Would you start a revival and start with this group
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.440]   and unleash your people and the message
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.580]   and the hope of eternal life that is found in Christ alone?
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.480]   We worship you in song, amen.
