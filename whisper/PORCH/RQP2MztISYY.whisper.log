[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.820]   Love it.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.340]   Well, I don't know what caused conflict in your family
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.980]   with your siblings when you were a kid,
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.180]   but when I was really young, younger than 10,
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.340]   my brothers and I would always fight over something
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.540]   called Sega Genesis.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.220]   And if you're younger than--
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.180]   or if you weren't born after like 1985,
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.100]   you probably don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.860]   We'd always fight over NBA Jam and Sonic the Hedgehog,
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.360]   and this would lead to all kinds of conflicts in our house.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.780]   And on one of these occasions, my younger brother,
[00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.740]   who was seven and I was nine at the time,
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.740]   got into a fight playing NBA Jam.
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.620]   Someone cheated, and all of a sudden, there's
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.540]   a fist fight going on.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.860]   And my mom walks into the room.
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.780]   She says, that's it.
[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.060]   I'm taking away Sega, and you're both getting spankings.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.060]   This was like before the spanking ban that's
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.620]   taking place.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.540]   And so I immediately and my brother
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.540]   walk to the edge of her bedroom, and she
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.820]   says, Michael, who's my little brother, you're up first.
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.580]   So he takes her in there.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.080]   And my mom was the kind of mom that
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.020]   would sit you down and walk you through.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.280]   Do you understand what you did?
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.820]   Do you know that this hurts me more than it hurts you?
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.460]   When you're nine, you're like, but I always leave crying.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.260]   How does it hurt you?
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.740]   And so she would walk through that whole experience.
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.220]   So that's going on, and she told me, stay outside the door.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.620]   Stand right here, and I'll get to you next.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.060]   So the door shuts, and it hits me.
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.860]   I've got like a minute and a half, maybe two minutes.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.340]   And so immediately, I take off up the stairs,
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.940]   and I go and begin to put on every pair of underwear
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.780]   and shorts that I own to create an insulation where
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.700]   the paddle, which we had like a spanking paddle, would strike.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.220]   And so my little brother comes out, quack, quack, ah,
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.540]   and he comes out of the room.
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.420]   And now it's my turn.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.420]   So I'm going in more confident than normal, and I sit down.
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.540]   Yes, I understand I've done something really wrong.
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.700]   Yes, I'm repentant.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.060]   She bends me over, and she realizes what's going on.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.300]   To which she looks and says, great, OK, well,
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.100]   we'll just wait for your father to get home.
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.260]   And I immediately knew, because then you
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.860]   longed for the paddle, because then the belt came out,
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.180]   and it got really, really bad, and no amount of padding
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.140]   could help you.
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.660]   And so that was my first experience of a principle
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.780]   that really all of us can relate to, and all of us
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.900]   have experienced in life, of rebellion.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.260]   When you rebel against a command,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.980]   whether it be from God or from your parents
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.900]   or whatever authority you're underneath,
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500]   there always is pain brought into your life.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.300]   And in that scenario, I was further
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.900]   introduced that the more you rebel,
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.740]   the more pain will oftentimes be brought
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.660]   into your life and to my life.
[00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.460]   And so as you and I go throughout life,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.500]   if you and I in any arena of life
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.060]   begin to rebel against God's authority or God's commands,
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.780]   we will introduce pain into our life.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.500]   And tonight, we're going to study the last three
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.420]   kings of Judah as we continue this series Game of Thrones.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.860]   And more than any other of the kings that I know of,
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.660]   they illustrate this principle that rebellion always
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.460]   brings pain.
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.020]   And when you go against what God has said,
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.940]   you go against life, and you will bring pain.
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.700]   Their names are King Jehoiakim, King Jehoiachin,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   and King Zedekiah, which I know everyone's really excited
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.620]   to write those down, which you can't spell.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.540]   So this will be the best sermon you've ever
[00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.540]   heard on King Zedekiah, because it'll probably
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.660]   be the only one you've ever heard on King Zedekiah.
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.160]   But these men-- and you may go, why are we talking about them?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.940]   What's interesting about these three kings
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.700]   is that 84 chapters--
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.180]   think about this--
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.820]   84 chapters in your Bible and in my Bible
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.620]   talk about these three kings.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.700]   The whole book of Jeremiah, the whole--
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.660]   or the first half of Ezekiel, Lamentations,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.140]   2 Chronicles 36, 2 Kings all speak of these men.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.780]   It was something about their story
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.900]   that God wanted to make sure you and I know.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.020]   I mean, Noah gets four chapters.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.660]   Abraham gets 12.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.260]   Yet these three kings, which we're going to observe tonight,
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.180]   get 84 different chapters.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.660]   So we're going to be in the book of 2 Kings.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.780]   And here's further what's going to be unique about tonight
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.860]   is we're going to jump around between 2 Kings 24 and 25,
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.260]   if you want to write that down and you're the kind of person
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.140]   who likes to go read it later, or 2 Chronicles 36,
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.620]   and then different parts of Jeremiah,
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.980]   because the entire book of Jeremiah
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.100]   is written as it related to these two kings.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.340]   So let me give you a little bit of recap about what's
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.460]   even in the Bible and where we are as it relates
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.580]   to these books.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.820]   So Game of Thrones is the study of the kings of Israel.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.580]   There was this few hundred years
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.220]   where Israel had these kings.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.380]   And the Old Testament is all about the history
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.520]   of the nation of Israel.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.120]   So inside of the Old Testament,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.340]   there's this little section that tells us
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.300]   about the kings of Israel.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.660]   It's called the historical books.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.660]   If you've ever read 1 Chronicles or 2 Chronicles,
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.960]   1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.580]   you can read about the kings of Israel.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.960]   And here's what's further interesting.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.880]   During that same time period of the kings,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.860]   there were these men called the prophets.
[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.140]   And the prophets are those pages in the middle
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.900]   of your Bible that it just seems like the guys
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.220]   are really angry, and I will bring calamity on you,
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.460]   and disaster, and I will do this and this.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.140]   And that was the prophets.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.780]   And those prophets lived, many of them,
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.740]   during the same time period of the kings.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.600]   And they speak about the same events
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.580]   that are going on with the kings.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.980]   And so during this three-king reign,
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.700]   Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.020]   there's a man named Jeremiah who writes his entire book
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.820]   about these three men.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.500]   And so that's what's going on as we jump in right here.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.900]   So last week, in the last couple weeks,
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.540]   we discovered the nation of Israel,
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.340]   they got a king, and God said, "You don't want a king.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.320]   "It's gonna be really, really bad if you get a king."
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.460]   They said, "No, no, no, we want a king.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.300]   "Give us a king."
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.780]   He said, "Fine, you can have a king."
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.220]   And that began a long series of one bad king
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.300]   after the next bad king after the next bad king.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.620]   The nation split up, and it just got really bad.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.140]   So much so that where our story picks up,
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.860]   the nation has split into two,
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.860]   and the southern kingdom, Judah,
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.980]   has just totally fallen apart.
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.900]   There's child sacrifice going on
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.100]   in the streets of Jerusalem and all throughout Judah.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.460]   The temple where God was to be worshipped
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.060]   was filled with all these idols.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.660]   They'd totally fallen apart because of one bad king
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.880]   after the next, and the nation refused to repent.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.380]   And so these three kings now have their chance
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.020]   to turn and repent, return the nation,
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.340]   to turn back to God.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.100]   And so we're gonna see what happens.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.620]   But because of so many bad decisions
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.580]   made by all the kings in the last couple hundred years,
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.380]   God basically said, "Hey, nation of Israel,
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.960]   "you're grounded, no more Sega Genesis for you."
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.000]   Maybe you had parents that would say,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.820]   "You're grounded," or "You're spanked," or whatever it is.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.460]   When God would punish or discipline the nation of Israel,
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.780]   here's what he would do.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.620]   He would bring in a foreign country
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.080]   to conquer his people and say,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.400]   "Hey, I want you to turn back and worship me,
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.380]   "and if you do, then I'll get rid of this foreign army
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.480]   "that's coming and conquering.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.980]   "But if you don't, then I will let you have foreign gods
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.460]   "and a foreign ruler."
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.100]   So at this time, Babylon has come in,
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.860]   and it's conquered Judah.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.740]   And this is around 600 BC.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.640]   You guys with me?
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.700]   And so around 600 BC, Judah has just so rebelled
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.620]   that God says, "Fine, I'm gonna give you over to Babylon."
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.300]   So Babylon comes in, they've conquered the known world,
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.640]   and they're led by a guy named Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.480]   And he sets up Jehoiakim,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.860]   who would be the third to last king in Judah's history.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.100]   The second king's 24, which is where we'll be.
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.620]   I would say if you are the kind of person
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.360]   who likes to follow along, tonight may frustrate you,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.900]   'cause we're gonna move and jump back.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.180]   So write these down, and you can read it later.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.380]   And for the next 20 minutes,
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.900]   it's gonna be a really unusual message,
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.360]   because we're just gonna go and see a movie.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.860]   I'm gonna take you through the story and see what happens,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.120]   and then at the end, we'll get a takeaway
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.620]   where we can all learn from the mistakes
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.460]   of these three kings.
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.280]   So here we go.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.540]   This is 2 Kings 21.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.140]   It's about Jehoiakim, who's our first king,
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.620]   and he's underneath Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.460]   This is what it says.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.340]   "During Jehoiakim's reign,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.220]   "Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, invaded the land,
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.140]   "and Jehoiakim became his vassal,
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.180]   "or his puppet king, for three years."
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.700]   So Nebuchadnezzar comes in, he says,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.260]   "Jehoiakim, look, I'm gonna let you stay in power,
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.620]   "but you're really my errand boy.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.340]   "Just pay me my taxes.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.740]   "Don't do anything stupid,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.100]   "and you can still have whatever crown you want around here,
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.180]   "but you're not really the king, I'm the king."
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.220]   And so here's what happens.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.220]   But then, he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.480]   So three years go by, and he goes,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.860]   "Look, I'm sick of being the errand boy.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.020]   "You know what, I'm the king.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.920]   "I'm done with this.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.120]   "I'm gonna rebel against Nebuchadnezzar."
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.060]   And here's, I've tried to think all week
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.860]   about how to communicate how insane this was.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.660]   The nation of Judah, rebelling against King Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.180]   who had conquered the known world,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.620]   would be a little bit like this.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.260]   It would be like Fort Worth,
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.700]   for you guys out there in Fort Worth,
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.820]   or Tarrant County within Fort Worth,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.700]   rebelling against the state of Texas.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.700]   That would be what it was like.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.840]   And you may be thinking over in Fort Worth,
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.400]   "Yeah, yeah, remember, come and take it.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.860]   "We got a lot of guns over in Fort Worth.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.700]   "This isn't Dallas.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.700]   "We got guns, we bringing guns to the ports."
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.700]   And you may put the fort back in Fort Worth.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.300]   And so any attempt that you would make,
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.400]   like that, didn't you?
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.940]   But regardless, no matter how many guns you have,
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.540]   it wouldn't stand against Fort Hood, or Fort Sam Houston,
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.060]   that it would just be insane, and eventually it would fall.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.060]   And so God raises up the prophet Jeremiah,
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.460]   because he spoke to the nation,
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.260]   and spoke to the king through the prophet.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.180]   He goes to Jehoiakim, and he says,
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.400]   "Hey, this is a bad idea.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.240]   "We're not gonna win this fight,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.160]   "not only because we are Fort Worth, and it's Texas,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.780]   "but because God is judging the nation.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.860]   "He wants us to worry not about going to war,
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.860]   "but about who we're gonna worship, and turn back to him.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.020]   "And so what are we gonna do?"
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.620]   And so Jeremiah gets this message from God.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.340]   And God says, "Hey, I want you to write this down,
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.500]   "and the king will read it, and hopefully,
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.380]   "he won't go to war against Nebuchadnezzar."
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.860]   And God gives him the message, and here's what it says.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.920]   "Jehoiakim, if you go to war, you will die.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.380]   "It will go bad for you.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.660]   "You need to tell the nation to get rid of the idols.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.320]   "If you go to war, everything will be destroyed,
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.260]   "and you will suffer.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.140]   "If you rebel, you will suffer for it."
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.700]   And so eventually, this scroll,
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.940]   King Jehoiakim knows that Jeremiah wrote it,
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.400]   so he goes, "Hey, somebody go get me that scroll.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.500]   "I wanna see what it says.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.180]   "I know that God speaks through him sometimes."
[00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.140]   So he goes, and he gets it, and he's sitting,
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.940]   the scripture tells us this, Jeremiah 36,
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.780]   if you wanna read it later.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.260]   He's sitting inside of his winter part of the palace,
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.660]   and he's sitting in front of a fire,
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.300]   and he asks, "Hey, somebody read me the scroll."
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.700]   And so one of his servants begins to read the scroll,
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.940]   and it's like, "If you rebel,
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.180]   "I'm gonna bring calamity on you and disaster,
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.640]   "and if you do this, your children and your throne
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.940]   "will be disintegrated."
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.700]   And at every page that's read,
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.940]   Jehoiakim looks, he takes the page,
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.280]   rips it out, and throws it in the fire.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.120]   Read another one.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.460]   And it says he showed no fear or any sign of repentance.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.680]   That he refused, I'm just not gonna listen to that.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.300]   Prophet.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.180]   And so this, I mean, we really can all relate to this.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.380]   When someone comes into our life
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.860]   and they tell us something we don't wanna hear,
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.740]   "Hey, I don't think you should do that, that's illegal,"
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.700]   or "I don't think you should date her,"
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.820]   or "I don't think you guys should hang out together,"
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.200]   or "Y'all shouldn't move in together,"
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.920]   there's something inside of all of us that can go,
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.740]   "You know what, well, I'm just not gonna listen
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.640]   "to you anymore.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.740]   "Every party needs a pooper,
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.380]   "and so I'm not gonna invite you to my parties anymore."
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.220]   Right?
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.500]   Like we've all at least seen this play out,
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.700]   and so that's what Jehoiakim's doing.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.280]   He's going, "Look, I'm just not gonna listen, Jeremiah.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.120]   "I'm the king.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.540]   "We're gonna rebel against King Nebuchadnezzar."
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.700]   So here's what happens.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.340]   This is 2 Chronicles 36.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.740]   King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked him,
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.500]   and he bound, speaking about Jehoiakim,
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.860]   so Nebuchadnezzar shows up,
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.580]   and he bound him with bronze shackles
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.180]   to take him to Babylon,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.380]   and he also took Babylon articles
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.820]   from the temple of the Lord
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.940]   and put them in his temple there.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.180]   So one day, there's a knock at the door,
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.900]   and it's Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.340]   and the scripture says there was no war.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.020]   He just walked in, he got off of his horse,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.660]   he said, "Jehoiakim, you're coming with me,"
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.540]   and he led him back in bronze shackles to Babylon
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.540]   as the city watched their king tied up and led away,
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.820]   and Jeremiah's sitting there thinking,
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.660]   "What were you thinking?
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.960]   "I told you, you can't go against God's word.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.360]   "If you go against God's word, you're going to lose,"
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.540]   and that's what happened,
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.820]   and then something happens.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.300]   Nebuchadnezzar, on his way out,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.980]   he says to Jehoiachin, who was Jehoiakim's son,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.960]   "Hey, look, you're the king now,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.200]   "but you're not really the king,
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.800]   "so just pay me my taxes
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.160]   "unless you wanna come with dad here.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.520]   "Just send me the money,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.480]   "and just don't do anything stupid,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.660]   "and everything will be fine,"
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.780]   and so the story continues.
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.180]   This is back in 2 Kings,
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.300]   and Jehoiachin is not the sharpest crown in the box,
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.140]   as we're gonna see.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.020]   Here we go, verse eight.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.420]   Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he became king.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.580]   That's probably some of the problem right there.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.060]   This is like a high school senior who's ruling a nation,
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.740]   and he reigned, check this out,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.720]   in Jerusalem three months.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.900]   The scripture tells us that three months went by,
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.560]   and Jehoiachin went, "You know what?
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.840]   "I think we can take him.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.440]   "I think we can take on Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.280]   "We're gonna be free.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.100]   "Who's with me?
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.940]   "Who wants to be free?
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.780]   "Let's do this,"
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.640]   and so he began to raise up an army,
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.660]   and began to refuse to pay taxes,
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.140]   and said, "What, what are you gonna do, Neb?
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.180]   "Come and get it,"
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.220]   and so the story continues with Jeremiah coming
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.940]   to this guy going, "Excuse me.
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.140]   "Hey, remember me?
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.880]   "I was friends with your dad.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.080]   "Do you think this is a good idea?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.080]   "Oh, you're gonna rebel?
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.580]   "Anybody else rebelled recently that you know of?
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.900]   "Oh, your father.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.320]   "How'd that go for him?
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   "Oh, it's gonna be different for you this time.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.380]   "This is a bad, bad idea, Jehoiachin.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.920]   "If you do this, God has spoken.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.420]   "You will pay for it for the rest of your life,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.080]   "and the nation will pay for it.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.860]   "It's not about how do we win this war.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.600]   "It's about who are we gonna worship.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.100]   "Turn back to God.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.400]   "Get rid of the idols throughout the country.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   "God is punishing you until that takes place,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.260]   "or he's allowing these foreign rulers to rule over you."
[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.960]   And Jehoiachin says, "No, I'm the king,"
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.860]   and so here's what happened.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.580]   Verse 15, Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.740]   to Babylon.
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.040]   He also took from Jerusalem the king's mother,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.880]   his wives, his officials,
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.300]   and the prominent people of the land, verse 16.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.800]   So Nebuchadnezzar shows up, says, "All right, great.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.560]   "We have to do this again.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.440]   "You're coming with me.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.860]   "Your whole family's coming with me,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.320]   "and not only that, check this out.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.100]   "The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.600]   "the entire force of 7,000 fighting men,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.660]   "strong and fit for war,
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.400]   "1,000 skilled workers and artisans."
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   So the scripture tells us,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.980]   Nebuchadnezzar does something really, really smart.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.460]   He shows up, "All right, I don't wanna do this again,
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.300]   "so here's what we're gonna do.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.920]   "Jehoiachin, you're coming with me again,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.320]   "and all of the army, you're coming with me as well,
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.660]   "and all the upper class."
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.060]   He takes everyone who makes over $100,000.
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.740]   "All of you guys, you're coming with me.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.480]   "We're all going back to Babylon."
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.040]   And Jeremiah's sitting there going,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.060]   "Why would you not listen to me?
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.400]   "I'm telling you, you can't go against God's word
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.540]   "and win," and they watch as they lead out Jehoiachin,
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.300]   the whole royal family,
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.900]   led out through the streets of Jerusalem,
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.400]   and they take him out, and they take all the upper class,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.900]   and so now the city is having to say goodbye
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.700]   to their neighbors, some of their family members,
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.060]   who are all being taken away thousands of miles.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.660]   Imagine if that happened here, if Canada,
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.700]   I don't know how that could be possible,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.220]   but came in and conquered,
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.940]   and they led all of us back to Canada,
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.220]   or large chunks of our country back to Canada.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.040]   How sad that would be, and you're sitting there,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.860]   Jeremiah, you're going, "It doesn't have to be like this.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.860]   "It doesn't have to be, obey.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:33.460]   "Obey, you can't go against the word of the Lord and win.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.020]   "Rebellion always brings pain."
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.380]   So surrender to God and submit to Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.460]   And so on his way out,
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.960]   Nebuchadnezzar sets up Zedekiah,
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.420]   who would be the last king that Judah would ever have.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.620]   And he sets up Zedekiah, and he goes,
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.380]   "Okay, Zedekiah, here you go, three rules.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.920]   "Ready for this?
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.120]   "The first two guys didn't get it,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.820]   "so here's three rules, Zedekiah.
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.980]   "You're not the king, I'm the king.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.940]   "You pay me my taxes, okay, rule number one.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.820]   "Rule number two, you get no army.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.120]   "I'm taking the army, don't raise an army.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.840]   "Rule number three, do not rebuild these walls
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.680]   "around this city.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.080]   "I want you to be weak and vulnerable.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.520]   "You do not do those three things.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.980]   "If I hear you do those three things,
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.300]   "I am coming back here to get you, Zedekiah."
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.020]   And so Zedekiah's just on the throne going,
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.500]   "Oh my gosh, I'm the king of Judah?
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.580]   "This hat, I have the whole palace?"
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.380]   And he's just, I don't know if he can't pay attention
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.140]   to what it is, but he does not listen again.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:32.980]   And we would think,
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.100]   "Oh, he just saw those two bad examples, uh-uh."
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.380]   And Zedekiah unfolds the rest of the story.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.940]   Verse 11, here's what happens.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.820]   Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.940]   and he reigned in Jerusalem 11 years.
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.580]   He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord his God,
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.380]   and he did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet,
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.520]   who spoke the word of the Lord to him.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.000]   That Jeremiah goes again to the king and says,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.080]   "You just saw what happened.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.940]   "God is giving Israel or Judah its last chance.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.680]   "Obey the Lord, obey him.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.560]   "Submit to Zedekiah, or submit to Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.640]   "and obey the word of the Lord."
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.400]   And it says, "He refused to listen."
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.260]   I'm gonna do what I wanna do.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.680]   I don't care what God says.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.380]   I don't care what anyone says.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.440]   I can control the outcome,
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.900]   and I can control the consequences.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.580]   We're gonna move in together.
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.300]   We're gonna sleep together.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.660]   I don't really care what anyone else thinks.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.760]   No, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.260]   Community is for somebody else.
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.020]   Reading their Bible is for somebody else.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.780]   I know, but I'm only 24.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.920]   This can't really hurt me.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.960]   Maybe someday I'll get cleaned up.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.120]   And Zedekiah invited through rebellion
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.640]   the consequences that would take place.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.960]   Here we go.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.880]   Verse 13, "And he," does something very, very stupid,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.960]   "he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.400]   "who made him take an oath in his God's name.
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.900]   "He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.440]   "and would not turn back to the Lord."
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.200]   And Jeremiah's going again.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.720]   Look, this is like Groundhog Day.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.960]   Are you kidding me?
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.240]   We just saw this happen.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.920]   Just the characters are changing.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.560]   God is not going to honor your rebellion.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.600]   If you rebel, Zedekiah, you die.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.720]   And he goes back to the king.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.440]   And if you read the book of Jeremiah,
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.520]   you feel for Jeremiah because he's like
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.960]   the only person in this story who's willing
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.080]   to listen to the word of the Lord.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.480]   Zedekiah begins to raise up an army.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.960]   He begins to build up the walls,
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.160]   and he's going, "I'm the king.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.360]   "I mean, it's not gonna happen to me.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.260]   "It happened to those guys,
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.000]   "but those two kings were losers.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.840]   "I'm different.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.080]   "It's gonna be different."
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.300]   And so all the people are going,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.160]   "Yes, we're gonna be free again."
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   The nation of Judah's going,
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.560]   "We don't have to be under Nebuchadnezzar."
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.360]   And the people are behind Zedekiah,
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.200]   and they're all excited.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.520]   We're gonna be free.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.940]   And so one day, they're having like a pep rally
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.220]   where everyone's together going,
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.280]   "Yes, freedom, freedom."
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.040]   And they're all hanging out together.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.280]   That's not really in there if you read it,
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.480]   but it is like a gathering.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.120]   And they all come together,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.400]   and the people are stoked.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.760]   We're gonna be free again.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.180]   And Jeremiah, poor Jeremiah, he shows up,
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.480]   and he's going, "Okay, nobody seems to get the message,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.720]   "so I'm gonna get a little creative."
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.000]   So he does an arts and crafts project,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.200]   and he makes a yoke that an ox would wear,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.680]   and he puts it on his back.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.220]   And he shows up at the pep rally and goes,
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.480]   "Can I get one word here?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.620]   "You see this yoke I'm wearing?
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.880]   "God wants the nation of Judah to wear the yoke
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.360]   "of Nebuchadnezzar just like I'm wearing this yoke.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   "And so if you don't, everybody's gonna die."
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.640]   And literally, in the midst of his speech,
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.180]   one of the king's right-hand men
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.980]   goes up and goes, "God gave me a word, too.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.040]   "We're gonna break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar!"
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.920]   And everyone goes nuts.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.080]   And Jeremiah's going, "First off,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.160]   "that took some time to make.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.420]   "Second off, you're idiots,
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.800]   "and you will not win this fight.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.520]   "You're not only fighting the Babylonian empire,
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.700]   "you're fighting against God, who has promised,
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.240]   "and through his word told you, you cannot win this fight."
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.400]   And so a couple years go by,
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.540]   and Zedekiah's thinking, "Hey, everything's going well."
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.100]   Scripture tells us that people begin to write their family,
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.140]   who'd been in exile, like they're writing letters.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.820]   "Hey, can't wait to have you back home, Sally.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.300]   "We're gonna rebel."
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.020]   And Jeremiah starts writing follow-up letters, saying,
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.180]   "Hey, get comfortable.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.500]   "You're not coming home anytime soon."
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.640]   And that's where he introduces,
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.160]   "Seek the welfare of the city you live in,
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.140]   "for I know the plans I have for you,"
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.660]   declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.680]   "and not bring you harm, Israel,
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.740]   "but you've gotta obey me."
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.140]   And so Jeremiah says, "Stay there,
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.980]   "and we're just all gonna buckle up back here,
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.660]   "'cause it's not going to be good."
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.800]   And so eventually, word gets back to Nebuchadnezzar
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.940]   that Zedekiah is not paying taxes,
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.500]   he's rebuilding the wall, and it's about to go bad.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   Here's what happens.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.420]   This is in 2 Kings 25, if you wanna read it later.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.180]   On January 15th, January 15th,
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.740]   the walls have been built back up, we've got an army.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.780]   Zedekiah is woken up, and they say,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.860]   "Zedekiah, you gotta come see this."
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.740]   And he walks outside of his palace room,
[00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.440]   and this is in 587, on January 15th.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.100]   We have so much documentation around this, it's amazing.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.700]   And he walks up to the city wall, and he looks out,
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.700]   and there is a vast, vast, vast army
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.180]   totally surrounding the city.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.380]   The scripture tells us that Nebuchadnezzar
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.260]   brought everybody, he was mad.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.940]   He brought the whole army, he brought the cooks,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.540]   he brought all the slaves, he brought the camels,
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.060]   because they came to basically camp out for two years.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.780]   Here's what they did, Nebuchadnezzar was really,
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.040]   really smart, and so Zedekiah is looking out,
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.700]   and he's never seen an army like this.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.300]   They have more people in the army
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.180]   than in this city of just poor people.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.000]   And he's looking out, and he's thinking,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.820]   "Uh-oh, this is not gonna be good."
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.500]   And what happens is Nebuchadnezzar begins to build a wall
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.620]   around the outside of the Jerusalem walls,
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.620]   and they put archers on their wall,
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.980]   and they say, "If anyone comes out, we kill 'em."
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.180]   And for 18 months, the city sat under siege,
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.180]   and they starved.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.560]   And so Zedekiah is now backed into a wall,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.380]   so he sends for Jeremiah.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.060]   And he had Jeremiah thrown in prison,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.860]   'cause he kept on being a buzzkill for everybody.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.020]   Hey, quit saying that.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.660]   And so he gets Jeremiah out of prison,
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.820]   and he says, "Jeremiah, will you pray to the Lord
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.460]   "that maybe he'll do something special here,
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.860]   "and he'll take those people down?"
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.600]   And Jeremiah's going, "I'm not gonna pray.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.860]   "God said you can't win this fight.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.640]   "You have one good option here.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:48.100]   "Go out and surrender, and put yourself underneath
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.860]   "the power of Nebuchadnezzar."
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.800]   And Zedekiah thinks about it, and he goes,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.820]   "I don't like that idea."
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.340]   And he asks him, "Is there anything else I can do?"
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.500]   And here's what Jeremiah says to him.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.020]   This is Jeremiah 38.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.880]   "Then Jeremiah said," starting in verse 17,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.900]   "to Zedekiah, 'This is what the Lord God Almighty,
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.340]   "'the God of Israel, says.'"
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.860]   You got one option.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.820]   "If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon,
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.000]   "your life will be spared, and the city
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.360]   "will not be burned down.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.260]   "You and your family will live."
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.180]   In other words, I'm inviting you to surrender to life.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.420]   Surrender, and not just surrender in hopes
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.260]   that you'll make it.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.500]   Jeremiah says, "I promise if you surrender,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.860]   "you will be guaranteed life.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.820]   "But if you don't," verse 18, "if you will not surrender
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.380]   "the officers of the king of Babylon,
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.960]   "the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.240]   "They will burn it down, and you yourself
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.500]   "will not escape from them."
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   And then Jeremiah said this, "Obey the word of the Lord
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.340]   "by doing what I tell you.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.080]   "You got one last chance.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.620]   "Your only hope is to surrender,
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.100]   "and throw yourself on the mercy of Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.380]   "the mercy of God.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.440]   "Obey the word of the Lord."
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.540]   Well, Zedekiah says, "I don't like that option."
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.780]   This is like when you're backed into a corner,
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.280]   and there really isn't any good options at this point
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.140]   that you're going to like.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.900]   And he says, "No, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.500]   "We're just gonna stay in this city.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.080]   "And if he wants to come and fight, we'll fight,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.820]   "but I'm not gonna do it.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.860]   "I won't surrender."
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.380]   And so the famine continued, and eventually things
[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:33.180]   got so bad that the Jerusalem wall,
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.140]   somebody started chipping away at it
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.780]   to get out of the city.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.140]   And they left at night, like Shawshank Redemption,
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.900]   where you're like going against the wall, building up.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.860]   And they left at night, and the king went with them.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.460]   He abandoned his city, and he snuck out with this group.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.700]   And here's what happened.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.300]   But the Babylonian army pursued the king,
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.420]   and overtook him in the plains of Jericho.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   All the soldiers were separated from him,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.140]   and scattered, and he was captured.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:04.580]   So Zedekiah runs away, and they grab him,
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.500]   and they bring him back.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.580]   He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah,
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.300]   which is just a city where sentence was pronounced.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.220]   So he's taken to Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.220]   and he's standing before this emperor.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.460]   And here's what they do.
[00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.940]   They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.820]   And then they put out his own eyes,
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.820]   and bound him with bronze shackles,
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.020]   and took him to Babylon.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.700]   That they slaughtered, and the last thing he would ever see
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.640]   was his children being slaughtered.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.060]   And then they poked out his eyes,
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.340]   and they led him back to Babylon,
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340]   because he refused to obey, to surrender,
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:50.300]   to accept that rebellion, you rebel against God's word,
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.380]   it always brings pain.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.700]   And he sent messenger after messenger,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.640]   listen to me, please, don't do this.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.820]   And Zedekiah, and Jehoiakim, and Jehoiachin
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.780]   did the same thing.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.540]   I don't care what God says, I'm gonna do it my way.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.820]   And God says to all of us who step outside
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.920]   of his commands, or who rebel against him,
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.980]   please, you will suffer for this.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.060]   Surrender, submit to my word and to my ways.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.740]   I want you to surrender, and in doing so,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.980]   you'll surrender to life.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.140]   But if you don't, you will suffer for it,
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.900]   you may even die for it, will you surrender?
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.340]   And then they did this, they went back,
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.700]   so they killed the sons and the family,
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.980]   and then they went back, verse nine,
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.180]   King Nebuchadnezzar set fire to the temple of the Lord.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.640]   Set fire to the royal palace,
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.560]   and all of the houses of Jerusalem,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.420]   every important building, they burned down.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.160]   The whole Babylonian army broke down the walls
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.340]   around Jerusalem, they tore down everything.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.720]   The temple would be no more.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:07.520]   All of Solomon's wonders that he had built were gone.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.040]   And there would be no more kings in Judah.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.180]   And Jeremiah was set free from that prison,
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.700]   and he's thinking, why?
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.380]   Why would you refuse to obey?
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.680]   We got sent these messages, I want life for you,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.960]   I love you Israel, I love you Judah,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.460]   I love you king, will you repent,
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.460]   will you turn back to me and obey my words?
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.160]   Because they will come true.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.100]   And yet they refused to listen.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.720]   I think it's like, crazy as that story is,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.880]   here's kind of the takeaway I think for us.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.760]   When you look at why that could be in scripture,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.040]   like why, God doesn't just record this story,
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.320]   he records it thoroughly.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.800]   I mean, the whole book of Jeremiah, Lamentations,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.680]   Ezekiel's first half, in 2 Chronicles and 2 Kings,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.640]   all of them, they talk about this story,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.980]   that's all Jeremiah's even about, and Lamentations.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.240]   Why is God going, I want you to make sure
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.000]   that you know about this?
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.200]   And here's why I think it is,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.080]   because all of us have a little bit of the king,
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.460]   Zedekiah and those three kings in us.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.240]   Well, I don't think rebellion's gonna bring that much pain.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.440]   I wanna do things my way.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.000]   And God says, I love you Israel, I love you David,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I love you porch, will you surrender to my ways?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.640]   And he goes to great lengths to make sure that you know,
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.080]   don't miss this story, it's not that I'm angry
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   or trying to pay them back,
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.820]   I'm trying to bring them back to me,
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.840]   because I love them.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.660]   And he loves you, and he wants you to surrender to life.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.040]   And if you're in the room and you're running,
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.080]   and you know you've been running,
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.840]   God stands outside the city like Nebuchadnezzar
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.140]   around those walls and he says,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.940]   surrender, you can't win this fight, will you surrender?
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:10.200]   I'm not angry at you trying to surrender to death
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.000]   and rip you off, I want you to surrender to life.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.840]   I love you.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.120]   And you know how I know that's true?
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.040]   Not just because you've repeatedly sent messengers,
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.960]   please, tell them to surrender.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:27.080]   But because a few hundred yards
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.800]   from where all of this took place,
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.280]   a few hundred yards from where all of this took place,
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.680]   outside of those walls that were broken down,
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.200]   a few hundred years later, Jesus, God and human flesh
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.440]   would show up and die on a cross to show that God says,
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.560]   I will pay any price to bring my children back,
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.360]   including the life of my son.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.040]   Will they surrender to me?
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.720]   Will you surrender?
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.420]   Because all of us just have things that eventually we go,
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.080]   I'm just gonna try it my way.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.040]   And God stands outside the gate saying,
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.920]   disaster will come apart from me.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.200]   We surrender to life.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.280]   And so I don't know what that looks like,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.960]   I think the application for all of us
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.440]   is just surrendering and submitting to God's word
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.120]   is always the best option.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.800]   And you may be going, yeah, duh.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.300]   But here's where I think that hits a lot of us in the room.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.480]   Some of you guys need to break up with your boyfriend,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.120]   or break up with your girlfriend.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   And you're going, no, it's not that bad,
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.560]   or I mean, he's a really good guy.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.500]   And God says, look, I am ringing the bell.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.720]   I'm trying to get you to surrender to life.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.260]   Some of you guys need to move out.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.560]   You're living together and you know it's wrong.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.440]   And you're going, yeah, but it's financially,
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.600]   you know, it's going well.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.560]   We will help you get finances worked out
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.520]   if you are a part of this body.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.840]   And if you're not, whatever body you're a part of
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.160]   will help you, I hope.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.060]   And if not, you may look at find another one,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.920]   or at least find a church body.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.240]   If you are addicted to Percocet,
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.760]   and you're going, look, but my doctor says everything's fine
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.520]   or whatever the prescription medicine.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.220]   And you know, God sits outside the walls
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.820]   and he says, we surrender.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.320]   And in doing so, you surrender to life.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.280]   Some of you may need to give up alcohol.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.240]   Not 'cause alcohol is inherently wrong,
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.140]   but when alcohol gets a hold of you, it's wrong.
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.360]   And you just make decisions.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.960]   And God who loves you says, will you surrender?
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.840]   Some of you need to delete phone numbers
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.480]   of friends tonight who are pulling you down.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.480]   And you need to wave the white flag and say,
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.560]   God, I'm coming in with my hands up, I surrender.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.960]   And you need to go to community group.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.560]   I don't know where it hits all of us,
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.400]   but there's parts of us where the rebellion in our hearts,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.480]   and you know if you're running.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.020]   And God says, you cannot outrun me.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.340]   You can run from me, but you will not outrun me
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.540]   because I love you.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.540]   Will you surrender to life?
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:04.240]   Some of you need to get rid of a computer
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.120]   or an iPad or internet that's pulling you
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.920]   in a direction and a porn addiction.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.040]   And you may not say, it's not really an addiction,
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.840]   but it has a hold on your life.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:22.520]   And so I don't know what it is for all of us in the room.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:28.000]   I, in college, one of the more exciting days
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.060]   that I had was coming home from a class.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.040]   And it was, I rode my bike to class
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.880]   and then I rode it home.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.640]   And I lived in a house that was near campus
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.800]   in College Station.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.140]   And there was seven,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.560]   and there was seven other roommates that I have.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.000]   So all these guys in this one house.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.160]   So I ride home and I get to my,
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.560]   and I'm parking my bike in the backyard.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.240]   And all of a sudden I see there's police officers
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.760]   in my backyard and in my neighbors.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.840]   And I'm like, oh my gosh, those parking tickets
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.040]   really came back to bite me.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.760]   And it wasn't that.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.240]   And so he comes up and says,
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.880]   hey, you gotta go in your house.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.480]   And so I'm going, what's going on out here?
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.200]   And so I go up in my house with my roommates
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.920]   and we're looking out the back window
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.200]   of the back of our house into our neighbor's yard.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.400]   We don't have a fence.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.240]   And we're looking out there and come to find out
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.120]   a guy had broken in to the house behind us.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.680]   And he had tried to steal a TV
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.080]   and a neighbor saw him, so they called the cops.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.440]   And so we're like sitting there watching this.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.720]   Like this is entertaining and exciting.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.560]   There's police everywhere surrounding the building.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.880]   They're Kevlar vests.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.240]   I mean, we're watching it.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.560]   And here's what hits us.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.160]   We know this is ending one of two ways.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.720]   I mean, none of the options end with this guy
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.640]   just kind of strolling out of there scotch free.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.840]   It ends in one of two ways.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.920]   Either he will choose to surrender
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.920]   or he will be forced to surrender.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.800]   'Cause whatever little revolver he has in there,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.840]   he had a gun, won't stand much of a chance
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.240]   to the SWAT team that showed up
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   and is totally surrounding the building.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.960]   And so we wait a little bit and then all of a sudden
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.680]   the police break down the door
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.520]   and he went with option number two, forced.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.040]   And he fired at 'em.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.280]   And nobody was hit or he wasn't injured.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.320]   But they fired back and he got shot in the leg.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.560]   And now he left with charges,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.120]   not just for trying to steal a TV,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.520]   but for shooting at a police officer.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.480]   And was forced into surrender.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.280]   And for all of us, like the messages of scriptures,
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.480]   and this may come across scary
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   and I don't want it to come across any more scary
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.240]   than it maybe should be, as God tells us.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.640]   Turn and surrender to life.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.200]   Or will one day either be forced to surrender
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.040]   or will choose today.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.160]   And so will you choose to surrender,
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.840]   whatever that is for you.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.640]   And I know you're sitting there and you're going,
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.040]   ah, yeah, that's not really me, I'm not gonna.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.120]   There will come a day
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.040]   and you'll either carry more scars and baggage
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   if it's down the road or if you surrender today.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.320]   And so will you choose today.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:09.560]   God who loves you says, choose him, surrender to life.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.440]   I'm gonna pray.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.960]   Oh, Father, thank you for the stories of these three men.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   Thank you for just your grace in the midst of our rebellion.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.360]   That you send us your messengers,
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   you send us your word and you offer us life.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.760]   I pray that we would respond to that.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.800]   I pray for my friends in the room
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.080]   who know they need to surrender.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.960]   Would they choose and surrender to you?
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.760]   Pray that even now as just the chaos that rebellion
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.120]   and sin bring into our life and consequences
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.280]   that it just brings.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.880]   As those feel overwhelming,
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.560]   that your hand would be heavy,
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.720]   not to make them feel like they owe you anything,
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.600]   but so that they would surrender to you
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.080]   who they do owe everything.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.840]   Through Jesus, thank you that you showed us
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.880]   how much you love us.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.520]   We love you, amen.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.520]   (silence)
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:15.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
