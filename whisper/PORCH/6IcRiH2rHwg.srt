1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,420
 Continuing this series, Datable,

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,520
 where we have been walking through,

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,280
 asking questions that generally nobody ever asks,

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,080
 from God's word to the question of,

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,920
 hey, are you datable?

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,740
 Is she datable?

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,580
 Is he datable?

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,540
 And tonight, we're gonna continue that theme

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,640
 and walk, like we mentioned a second ago,

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,320
 what it looks like to date according to the principles

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,280
 from God's word, the datables, if you will.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,320
 Let me start with a story of kind of something recent

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,680
 in my world, my life.

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,920
 My son is five years old,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,860
 plays on a soccer team called the Knights.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,420
 His dad is the coach, which would be me.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,760
 This team had our first game last Saturday.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,120
 We had a couple of practices under our belt,

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,560
 got four on four, five-year-olds,

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,360
 got six five-year-old kids,

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,220
 looking at 'em, trying to teach 'em how to kick the ball.

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,840
 We go to the game, and we get smoked.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,440
 I mean smoked like, just obliterated.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,880
 One of the kids on the other team,

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
 like, they stopped counting score after some point,

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,440
 'cause it was 12 to zero, and it was like,

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,580
 this is so demoralizing, especially for five-year-olds.

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,920
 But they get a juice box, they bounce right back,

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,000
 but to the point where, there was a kid, no lie,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
 they're running down the field,

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,540
 and this is a kid on the other team,

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,440
 who was like the next Ronaldo or something.

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,760
 He runs, and he, at the end,

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,480
 does a sliding kick into the goal.

36
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,580
 Then, gets up, runs, and does a knee slide,

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,240
 like he's in, like Pele, with the Superman.

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
 He's fine.

39
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,260
 It was like, man, I'm just so impressed right now.

40
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,280
 Honestly, guys, we're getting to be a part

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,300
 of seeing the next Pele.

42
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,140
 This is special.

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,700
 I didn't think it could get worse,

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,260
 and I assumed this has gotta be the best team

45
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,140
 that we're gonna play, and so we went back to practice.

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,300
 Hey, this is a soccer ball, teach 'em the fundamentals.

47
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,140
 Here we go, guys.

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,780
 Then we had our next game.

49
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
 It was this Saturday.

50
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,300
 I thought there couldn't have been a better team

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,220
 than the last one that we played, until I saw this team.

52
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,880
 This team beat us 13 to zero, and it was four on four,

53
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 and in the last half, the second half of a two-part game,

54
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,700
 they only played with three players,

55
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,740
 and their coach was like, you guys gotta pass it

56
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,300
 eight times before you score.

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,700
 (audience laughs)

58
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,380
 It was like total mercy rule, and it didn't help

59
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,180
 that our own players were scoring on our goal

60
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,380
 at some points, but this team was remarkable.

61
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,740
 I mean, they were running plays.

62
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,860
 It was like, I have failed all of you as your coach.

63
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,300
 I'm so embarrassed, and I realized something after the game.

64
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,940
 The coach on the other team was hired by the parents.

65
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,060
 He's a professional soccer coach trainer.

66
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,780
 Yeah, when you're doing that for five-year-olds,

67
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,060
 there's something wrong with the parent in that situation,

68
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,500
 but he was teaching them everything, every play.

69
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,180
 They knew just what to do, because they had

70
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,940
 this professional coach that was coming along

71
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,540
 that had equipped and trained and prepared them,

72
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,020
 unlike in our team, where we're just trying to get 'em

73
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,820
 to stop picking daisies and stuff and play the game,

74
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,880
 and they just got destroyed.

75
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,740
 What does that have to do with dating?

76
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,660
 Well, I think oftentimes in life, a lot of us

77
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,660
 are like my son's team that was unequipped to play the game.

78
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,020
 In other words, unlike the other team,

79
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,700
 where they had coaching and they had somebody

80
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,040
 who taught 'em how to come along and professionally

81
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,860
 just knew exactly what they're doing

82
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,540
 and knew exactly how to train a five-year-old,

83
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,900
 most of us go through dating, and we just get,

84
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,780
 like my son's team, just destroyed,

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,100
 because we've never had a good coach,

86
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,300
 someone to teach us how to approach this subject,

87
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,420
 and by that, you may be thinking,

88
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,920
 no, man, I know exactly what I'm doing.

89
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,420
 Most of us learn how to start dating,

90
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,420
 and most of us started dating and learned to date

91
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,660
 all around the same time, right after puberty,

92
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,340
 15, 16 years old, that's kinda when you were introduced

93
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,020
 to at least some strong interest in the opposite sex,

94
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,620
 and it's around that time that kinda generally,

95
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,580
 everybody is learning how to do it together,

96
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,820
 whether it's their friends are telling 'em how to date

97
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,700
 and how to think, or whether it's society and culture

98
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,880
 and Taylor Swift and Cory and Topanga,

99
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,260
 they're all teaching 'em, this is how you should think,

100
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,580
 about relationships.

101
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,600
 And sadly, having the wrong coach

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,040
 that doesn't walk through play by play

103
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,620
 leads to a lot of us having a lot of baggage

104
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,780
 and a lot of pain and a lot of destruction in our lives.

105
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,500
 And so the good news is, God,

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,140
 more than any person in this room,

107
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,460
 wants you to have an amazing marriage.

108
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,380
 More than any person that is in a dating relationship,

109
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,680
 God is more for you having an amazing marriage someday

110
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,100
 than even you are, and so all throughout the Bible,

111
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,860
 we are given principles and truths to help inform

112
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,100
 how we think about love, romance, marriage,

113
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,980
 who to look for.

114
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,300
 We said before, the Bible doesn't talk about dating

115
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,420
 because it wasn't around back then,

116
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,480
 but it has a lot to say about decision-making,

117
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,820
 about evaluating, about romance, about marriage,

118
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,860
 about the type of qualities that make for a good spouse.

119
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,340
 And so what I wanna do is I wanna walk through

120
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,900
 and apply some of those principles as it relates to dating,

121
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,260
 how to go from the ask out to the alter,

122
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,940
 because this is the single most important

123
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,660
 human relationship you're gonna decide.

124
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,940
 And so you and I need to go in with the right mindset,

125
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,860
 looking for the right qualities and characteristics.

126
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,460
 And to anyone in the room who's going,

127
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,820
 hey, you're just gonna take principles,

128
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,100
 and the Bible doesn't talk about dating,

129
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,840
 and so you're just gonna tell me kind of

130
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,940
 what your experience and what your perception is.

131
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,780
 Let me simplify.

132
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,980
 If you're just going, hey, what is the ultimate?

133
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,280
 I want just a quick answer.

134
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,460
 How should I date?

135
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,660
 How can I date God's way?

136
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,500
 I'm gonna give you the answer.

137
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 Here, two words.

138
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 Honor them.

139
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,240
 Honor her if you're a guy.

140
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,340
 Honor him if you're a girl.

141
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,480
 Now the problem is, is that this idea of honor,

142
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,660
 'cause you could just be that simple and be like,

143
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,020
 let's go watch the milkshake game.

144
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,580
 The problem is we live in a society and culture

145
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,620
 that has lost an understanding

146
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,080
 of what it means to honor someone.

147
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,840
 We're so self-absorbed and so self-focused

148
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,920
 and so selfie culture that when it comes to a relationship

149
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,840
 that is not about ourself, 'cause by definition,

150
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,560
 a relationship is putting our eyes on another person,

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,440
 we've lost an understanding of how to honor them.

152
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,040
 And so what I wanna do, and I am so committed,

153
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,560
 and I want with all of my heart

154
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,520
 what I'm about to say to happen,

155
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,600
 I wanna walk through, based on the last 12 years

156
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,000
 of experience, based on what God's word teaches

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,500
 and how to apply principles to honor them

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,740
 in every phase of the dating relationship,

159
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,680
 my full sinned hope for this message

160
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,140
 is that God will launch amazing marriages in this room.

161
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,640
 That guys, there's gonna be a girl

162
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,120
 that you look to in this room, you ask her on a date,

163
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,600
 you end up getting married, send me a card.

164
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,800
 That there are girls, he asks you on a date,

165
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,960
 you end up getting married, you have babies,

166
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,540
 and you raise disciples who love Jesus.

167
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,700
 That is my unashamed goal, candidly,

168
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,280
 and if everybody gets married next week

169
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,720
 and we're gonna become a young married ministry together,

170
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 we will do that, that would be amazing.

171
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,220
 And so that is my hope and my goal.

172
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,660
 And so what I wanna do is I wanna walk through

173
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,940
 with Ben and Becca, that's got a cute ring to it,

174
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,060
 I'll say that, Ben and Becca are gonna help us

175
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,660
 walk through the different stages.

176
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,720
 They're just gonna sit, and as we progress through,

177
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,940
 they're gonna come, so will you guys help me

178
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,740
 welcome one more time Ben and Becca to the stage?

179
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,740
 (audience cheering)

180
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,280
 It's just a milkshake until it isn't.

181
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,840
 All right, Ben, you're gonna be right over here

182
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,620
 at the ask out seat, you're gonna be right over here

183
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,000
 at the ask out seat, we're gonna walk through

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,280
 each of these seven stages as it relates to

185
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,880
 how do I honor the other person?

186
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,000
 As simple as this may seem, if you will apply these truths,

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 you will be automatically in the top 1% of daters out there

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,320
 and so my heart is to see you thrive.

189
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,000
 Are you guys blowing kisses or something back here?

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,760
 (audience laughing)

191
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,400
 What did I miss, anything you'd like to say?

192
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,680
 Okay, so stage number one is the ask out, the meeting.

193
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,320
 This is very, very important, so men, listen up here.

194
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 Guys, ask girls on dates, on dates, not to hang,

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,960
 sir, you can clap for that, not, don't ask to chill,

196
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
 don't ask what you got going on, don't ask,

197
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,680
 hey, you know, got any plans this week?

198
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,600
 Don't text or DM at 11.30 at night like a weirdo

199
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
 and say you up, don't do any of that.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,900
 You find them in person, you ask them on a date,

201
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,480
 when you do, you use the word date, D-A-T-E,

202
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,080
 very important, you use that word.

203
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,760
 You may not care about it, she will care about it

204
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
 'cause if not, you'd be like, hey, you know,

205
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,640
 what you doing, she's like, I don't know

206
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,040
 what you're asking me to do.

207
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,280
 And it, you're welcome.

208
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,680
 In addition, again, I'm just talking to the men

209
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,800
 who wanna be in top 1%.

210
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,320
 If you're great being the bottom 99,

211
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,440
 like everybody else in the world, you do you.

212
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,360
 If you wanna be in top one, hey, this is also an addition.

213
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,000
 You give them specifically what you would like to do.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,920
 In other words, you say, in other words, you say,

215
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,200
 hey, I'd like to take you on a date this Saturday night.

216
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,880
 If you don't have plans, I'd love to take you to dinner

217
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,600
 and then go to an art museum, I'd love to go to a walk

218
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
 after getting some Tex-Mex, you tell them

219
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
 what you would like to do.

220
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,300
 Here's why this matters.

221
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,120
 You've been thinking about this for like six hours

222
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,240
 or at least six, you've been thinking maybe for six days,

223
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,340
 you're gonna ask her, you may have like your small group

224
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,600
 texting you, how's it going, have you asked her yet?

225
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
 You've been thinking about it.

226
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,360
 She hasn't, she's getting like .0 seconds to evaluate,

227
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,220
 do I wanna do this?

228
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,980
 And so you can honor her by giving clarity

229
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,980
 to exactly what I'm asking you to participate in or to do.

230
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,720
 In addition to that, girls, go on dates.

231
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,560
 Don't go kick it, don't go say yes to hanging,

232
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,280
 don't say yes to you up, say yes to dates.

233
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,680
 In my opinion, this is my opinion,

234
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,560
 a godly girl should go on a date,

235
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,280
 just give a godly guy a date.

236
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
 I mean, I hear this every week of girls going,

237
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
 you know, the problem is guys just never ask girls on dates.

238
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,040
 Part of the problem is also that girls,

239
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
 when they do get asked, they end up saying no

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,440
 and they just contribute to this culture.

241
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,780
 (congregation cheering)

242
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,720
 And honestly, man, I haven't done this the last 12 years,

243
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,080
 I will see some of you guys all the time,

244
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,900
 especially these porch leader or porch volunteers,

245
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,920
 porch leaders, I'm just gonna pick on you for a second

246
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
 'cause I'll see some of you guys, I'm like,

247
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,880
 man, that's a cute girl, we should take her out.

248
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,760
 Or here's, you know, there's somebody in our church

249
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,000
 and, or here's a cute guy, I'm gonna arrange that date.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,880
 And without ever meeting them or even seeing them in person,

251
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,240
 they will immediately pull up the phone,

252
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,000
 pull up the Instagram account and see a photo,

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,040
 a single photo and say, no, I don't do beards.

254
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,100
 I don't do beards, what?

255
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,400
 I mean, you're looking at, sometimes it's a private account

256
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,960
 so you're looking at a tiny, tiny, tiny little head

257
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,440
 and you're deciding this person

258
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,480
 is not worth spending any time with, I'm not attracted to them

259
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,520
 attraction is something that grows over time

260
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,720
 and it grows through conversation,

261
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 it grows through getting to know someone's personality

262
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,440
 and you're gonna say through a photo, no?

263
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,280
 Especially when other believers around you are saying,

264
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,240
 hey, you guys should go on a date.

265
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,240
 So girls, go or say yes to dates, not anything else.

266
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,560
 Guys, if she says no, you respect her and you honor,

267
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,960
 you don't stalk, you don't think she's just playing hard

268
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,400
 to get, I'm gonna ask again tomorrow.

269
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,880
 She's not playing hard to get.

270
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,120
 Said no, for whatever reason, she doesn't wanna do that.

271
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,440
 Matthew chapter seven, verse 12 says,

272
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,000
 a reflection of honoring that in everything you do,

273
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,560
 do unto others as you would have them do unto you

274
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,640
 for this sums up the law and the prophets.

275
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,480
 So here's some questions people are gonna ask.

276
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,960
 Can Ben, can he DM Becks over here?

277
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,920
 Is that an appropriate way to ask out?

278
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,560
 I mean, sure, if you were gonna rank like what is the,

279
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,440
 what will she respect and appreciate more?

280
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,880
 You could put them in this rank, ask them in person.

281
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
 If you have their phone number,

282
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
 you can ask them on the phone.

283
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,640
 Then you got text message, then you got DM,

284
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,520
 then you got Snapchat down at the bottom dwellers

285
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,160
 and then Tinder all the way at the basement down there.

286
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,400
 And if you will ask her in person

287
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,000
 and Ben looks like a standup guy.

288
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,480
 Sure, he does this all the time.

289
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,900
 Ask in person, Becca can then decide and I'm telling you,

290
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,000
 they will appreciate both the clarity and your willingness

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,280
 to be courageous in doing that 'cause that's the challenge.

292
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
 I mean, here's why we don't like to ask.

293
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,760
 Here's like why guys like to go,

294
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,960
 this lady's good for you to know for better or for worse

295
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,580
 is there's part of us that fears rejection.

296
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,560
 So anything we can do to avoid being rejected,

297
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,000
 we're gonna naturally drift towards that.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,380
 And so because I'm afraid to be rejected,

299
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,480
 what happens is we end up going back and forth

300
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,820
 on some sort of texting or some social media,

301
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,360
 like 50 different times and it's some version of like flirty

302
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,740
 why are you asking me all these questions back and forth?

303
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,520
 'Cause they're just trying to put the feel out

304
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,160
 and I'm telling you guys, be courageous.

305
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,440
 If you risk being rejected and she says no,

306
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,140
 I am so proud of you.

307
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,600
 You crushed your part.

308
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,680
 If you honor her by asking in a way that says

309
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
 it's specifically a date,

310
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,400
 here's specifically what we're gonna go on,

311
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,600
 you and she says no, you have crushed your part.

312
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,640
 I am so proud of you and you are officially

313
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,760
 in the top 1% of date asker outers.

314
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,800
 Congratulations.

315
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,200
 Don't determine it based on whether or not they say yes.

316
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,520
 That's the asker.

317
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,000
 Okay, so let's say Ben, he asked Bex,

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
 this is outside of the milkshake game,

319
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,780
 he asked her on a date, she says yes,

320
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,480
 then they're gonna move to the next seat,

321
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,340
 which is the date.

322
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,940
 What does it look like to go on that date,

323
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,600
 honor God, honor her, honor him and do that together?

324
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,340
 So the second idea is the date or the second phase.

325
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,700
 Where?

326
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,180
 Again, all of this underneath honor one another.

327
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,620
 Romans chapter 12 verse 10 says honor everyone.

328
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,860
 Honor, honor.

329
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,360
 The date, where should you go?

330
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,800
 Somewhere in public and somewhere

331
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,640
 you can have a conversation.

332
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,620
 The entire point of dating is to evaluate

333
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,860
 is this someone that I want to spend more time with,

334
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,900
 someone that could be over the course of time,

335
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,300
 someone that I move in a relationship

336
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,620
 that moves towards marriage with.

337
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,140
 And so every date is a chance to get greater clarity,

338
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,780
 not to impress them, but to in some ways,

339
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,540
 interview and interrogate who is this person.

340
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,700
 This is a huge role.

341
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,780
 No more important relationship in my life exists

342
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,620
 than my wife.

343
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,820
 So I wanna make sure that on dates,

344
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,980
 I'm getting to know this person before I rule them in

345
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,820
 or rule them out.

346
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,940
 What does this mean?

347
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,980
 It means that going to see an Avengers movie

348
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,620
 for the first date, probably not a great move

349
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,140
 for a variety of reasons.

350
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,260
 She's not gonna like it.

351
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,460
 And you won't be able to talk and communicate.

352
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,300
 Okay, there's a couple of Avenger fans over here.

353
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,620
 Point being, man, you can do that at home.

354
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,460
 You can do that alone.

355
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,020
 Go and have a conversation,

356
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,180
 a place where you can communicate together.

357
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
 Maybe that's going to dinner and on a walk,

358
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,020
 dinner and a sports game, lunch and a walk,

359
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,260
 lunch in an art gallery.

360
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,780
 And let me set this,

361
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,780
 'cause the bachelor has created such pressure for men

362
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,240
 to think, oh my gosh, the first date, I gotta go big.

363
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,180
 I gotta get us tickets to fly up to Vail

364
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,260
 and then we're gonna do a one day trip

365
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,160
 or I gotta pick her up in a helicopter.

366
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,340
 Don't do that, don't do that.

367
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,180
 One, she's gonna find it creepy.

368
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,700
 Like, bro, this guy is desperate.

369
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,900
 He picked me up in a helicopter.

370
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,260
 I was all about it and it's not necessary.

371
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,820
 And so you take her on a date,

372
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,060
 you spend time, you have a conversation

373
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,540
 and Ben, let's say he's getting to know

374
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,180
 and he's speaking with Bex and they're on that date

375
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,180
 and the bill comes.

376
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,700
 What should Ben do?

377
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,540
 Ben pays for her date.

378
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,220
 I don't know where our world lost this,

379
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,700
 but it is not honoring.

380
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,380
 If I was to ask you to come with me to the store

381
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,460
 and I was like, hey, you wanna come to the store with me?

382
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,020
 And while we're driving to the store,

383
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,940
 I say, I'm asking you to do something

384
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,140
 you weren't going to do until I asked you to do, a date.

385
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,960
 On the way to the store, I ask you,

386
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,540
 hey, would you mind paying for half the gas

387
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,420
 in the car on the way there?

388
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,300
 You'd be like, bro, you asked me to come with you

389
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,940
 to the store.

390
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,460
 If you're gonna ask her on a date,

391
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,080
 you pay for the meal.

392
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,540
 As simple as that is, for whatever reason,

393
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,980
 so many people don't know that.

394
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,480
 You don't split the check, you don't use a coupon.

395
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,980
 Coupons are probably fine, I guess.

396
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,980
 But you pay for her meal, you honor her.

397
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,420
 What should we talk about?

398
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,820
 What should you talk about on the date?

399
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,180
 This is another area where, man,

400
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,180
 Christians, they just get weird, man.

401
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,260
 It's weird.

402
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
 You got several weird where you go,

403
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,500
 I was encouraged by the brother earlier

404
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,140
 who was like, I probably wouldn't do that on the first date,

405
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,980
 I'd keep it light.

406
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
 That is the correct answer,

407
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,300
 that you keep it light, not heavy.

408
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,260
 You keep it intentional, but not intense.

409
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,340
 You keep it casual and not creepy.

410
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,980
 You're not asking, hey, how many children

411
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
 would you like to have?

412
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,500
 And what would you like to name them?

413
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 And this is what I plan to have.

414
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,420
 You walk through and you keep it casual

415
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,340
 and you keep the conversation.

416
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,360
 You ask where they're from.

417
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,700
 What do they like to do for hobbies?

418
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
 How many siblings do they have?

419
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,020
 Where do they work?

420
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,940
 When was the first time that they went to the mountains?

421
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,620
 Any question that's just gonna keep the conversation,

422
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,460
 you're just getting to know this person.

423
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,740
 It's just a date.

424
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,220
 And so you pay for the meal,

425
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,540
 you do it at a place where you can talk,

426
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,500
 and you talk and you keep it light.

427
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 If there's a second date possibility,

428
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,420
 if at the end of the date, Ben is going,

429
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,460
 man, I really had a great time.

430
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,980
 And so I think I'd like to ask her to go on a second date.

431
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,060
 And he makes that ask and he says,

432
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,920
 Becca, that milkshake was delicious.

433
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,340
 I would like to go get another milkshake with you.

434
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,880
 And Becca is sitting over here and she's thinking,

435
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,060
 not me, not me.

436
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,620
 She doesn't say, sure, that would be great.

437
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,580
 Why?

438
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,960
 'Cause that's a lie.

439
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,260
 She doesn't want that.

440
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,880
 Ephesians chapter four says that Christians

441
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,100
 are to speak the truth to one another in love,

442
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,460
 that we are to be honest.

443
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,780
 And so if at the end of the second date

444
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,620
 or at the end of the first date,

445
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,180
 you don't wanna go on a second, hot take number two,

446
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,820
 I think a second date is always a good chance

447
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
 to make sure you've properly evaluated

448
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,220
 because a single meal together

449
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,980
 with the waiter interrupting you

450
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,520
 and with you guys trying to talk and converse

451
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,760
 is not always the perfect,

452
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,820
 man, I'm just going on a soap bar.

453
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
 It's not always the perfect opportunity to evaluate.

454
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,660
 Why?

455
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,480
 'Cause some of you guys are introverts,

456
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,320
 some of you guys are extroverts,

457
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,460
 some of you guys are comfortable meeting new people,

458
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
 some of you guys aren't comfortable.

459
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,300
 And so if you judge an entire person

460
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,500
 based on, oh my gosh, that one awkward interaction,

461
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,340
 you're probably gonna rule out some strong candidates.

462
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,180
 But you do you.

463
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,980
 So anyways, she, at the end of the date,

464
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,100
 decides I do wanna go on a second date

465
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,380
 or she's thinking I'm not sure if I want to.

466
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,200
 What does she say?

467
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,540
 I'm not sure.

468
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:46,180
 And Ben, because I know this bro is probably a gentle man,

469
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,860
 he, when he asks her, say,

470
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
 and if you'd like to take some time to think about it,

471
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,280
 you can get back to me or you can let me know.

472
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,100
 Now let's say Ben has a great milkshake, great time,

473
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,820
 doesn't really wanna go further.

474
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,700
 At the end of that date, does he say,

475
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,800
 man, this was great, I'll call you?

476
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,700
 Not unless he's going to call her.

477
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,500
 And this has really become a big deal.

478
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,180
 And it's funny, but you guys are doing this.

479
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,780
 You just lie.

480
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,300
 You ghost people.

481
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,940
 It's not honoring to God.

482
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,620
 And so if it's not true, don't say it.

483
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,780
 And what happens, and the reason why knowing this

484
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,100
 is important is because whenever we're in that situation,

485
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,340
 we just get nervous.

486
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,380
 And so we're sitting there, we're on the date,

487
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,740
 and they ask us, and he's like, oh my gosh,

488
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
 I didn't see that coming.

489
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,260
 And then he asks, and I'm like, uh, yeah.

490
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,780
 And so knowing, I'm in.

491
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,620
 Now I know what to do.

492
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,780
 If I don't wanna go on a date with someone,

493
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,500
 I just say, thank you so much for dinner.

494
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,280
 This was really fun.

495
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,680
 I'm just not interested in going on a second date.

496
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,200
 So we go out in public.

497
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
 If there isn't a second date

498
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,500
 or if there's gonna be a second date,

499
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,020
 we speak the truth.

500
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,260
 Ephesians chapter four, verse 15.

501
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,000
 Rather speaking the truth in love,

502
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,700
 we are to grow up in every way.

503
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,140
 We're honest with other people.

504
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,780
 But let's say the relationship keeps going.

505
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,220
 Ben and Beck, they go on a few more dates,

506
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,060
 a few more milkshakes, they get the Tex-Mex,

507
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,220
 things are going great.

508
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,380
 And they find themselves at a place

509
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,960
 where they're in that kind of middle zone,

510
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,700
 where it's not clear boyfriend, girlfriend,

511
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,980
 but they're going on some dates.

512
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,180
 And it really would be weird if Ben found out

513
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,220
 that Beck was going on a date with another guy

514
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,100
 and he's like, man, I gotta lock this thing in.

515
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,860
 They move to what is called the DTR.

516
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,900
 They move the seat.

517
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,100
 You guys don't know about the DTR.

518
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,100
 I'm about to tell you about it, okay?

519
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,520
 DTR stands for what?

520
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,820
 Define the relationship.

521
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,300
 This is that moment where maybe it's four or five dates in,

522
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,420
 Ben finds himself or you find yourself

523
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,280
 or that person finds himself going,

524
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,180
 man, I wanna date this person exclusively.

525
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,820
 I don't wanna leave her wondering

526
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,220
 'cause so many people leave, so many people wondering.

527
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,060
 I wanna make clear, I would like to move this forward

528
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,940
 and I'd like to ask her to be my girlfriend

529
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,620
 out of an attempt to honor her.

530
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,580
 And I'm gonna define the relationship.

531
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,060
 And that can look like sitting down

532
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,300
 and having the conversation

533
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,380
 where if it's Ben and Beck's or Sarah and Steve,

534
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,940
 and he says, I've really enjoyed dating you.

535
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,500
 I'm not sure you're the person I'm gonna marry,

536
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,240
 but I would like to pursue and continue dating you

537
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
 because you're the type of person I hope to marry.

538
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,040
 I'd like you to be my girlfriend.

539
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,500
 That last word, really, really important.

540
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,020
 For you, you're like, man, titles don't mean anything.

541
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,100
 They do to her, okay?

542
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,220
 And so it's really important for you to incorporate.

543
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,100
 You're gonna sit down, you're gonna have the conversation.

544
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,140
 And if Beck's, if Ben initiated that, and Beck's,

545
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:45,980
 Beck's?

546
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,700
 Or Becca?

547
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,620
 Beck's?

548
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,020
 (audience laughing)

549
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,780
 And if she's like, man, I honestly was about to say,

550
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,300
 I don't really wanna keep going on dates with you.

551
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,540
 She says that.

552
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,920
 Or she says, I would like that.

553
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,900
 I would like to be your girlfriend.

554
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,740
 And Ben, I know you've been here before, I'm sure.

555
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,640
 I know I have.

556
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,420
 This conversation, men, there's no way around it.

557
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
 It's gonna be awkward.

558
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,300
 You're gonna find yourself tripping over your words.

559
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,820
 You're trying to figure out how to say it.

560
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,460
 And you're in her car one night after the porch

561
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,700
 or out here on the lawn.

562
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,820
 All of us are gonna walk past you

563
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,940
 and you're gonna have this conversation.

564
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
 You're dating that girl.

565
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,300
 You look over at her and you're like,

566
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,820
 look, Beck's, and your voice is gonna start cracking

567
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,980
 and you're gonna feel like the Eminem song

568
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,440
 of like, knees are weak, arms are heavy,

569
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,480
 vomit on a sweater already.

570
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,260
 Mom's getting nervous, but on the surface,

571
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,300
 he is calm and ready.

572
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,660
 Beck's, I,

573
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:42,220
 I would like for you,

574
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,880
 I'm not sure you're the person I'm gonna marry,

575
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,780
 but you're kind of the type of person I was,

576
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,020
 you know what he said up there.

577
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,220
 And I'd like for you to be my girlfriend

578
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,420
 and you're gonna feel awkward.

579
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,780
 It's gonna be like you went back to junior high locker room

580
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,220
 and you're gonna be nervous.

581
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,500
 And you know what all of that means?

582
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 You're doing it right.

583
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,300
 You're being courageous.

584
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,740
 You're leading and bringing clarity.

585
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,020
 I have never heard of a person who has that conversation

586
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,220
 and it's just like, yeah, it was smooth,

587
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,180
 it was easy and all that stuff.

588
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,580
 No, that typically reflects something wrong with the guy

589
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,280
 or that he doesn't have interest.

590
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,020
 And so it may be awkward, it may be clunky,

591
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,900
 it may be uncomfortable,

592
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,420
 but you do and you honor God and you honor her

593
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,140
 by defining the relationship

594
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,460
 and bringing clarity to the relationship.

595
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,700
 First Corinthians chapter 13 says,

596
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,380
 love doesn't leave a little mystery,

597
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,780
 love doesn't self-protect, 'cause that's what that is.

598
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,460
 I mean, we just don't wanna define the relationship

599
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,480
 'cause we're afraid of being hurt.

600
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,020
 Love doesn't do those things.

601
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,020
 Love, verse five, does not dishonor others.

602
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,220
 It is not self-seeking or self-protecting.

603
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,060
 It's not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

604
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,380
 Perhaps the most consistent feedback I will hear

605
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,180
 among dating couples is, I'm so frustrated

606
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,580
 they send mixed signals constantly.

607
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,900
 That they're holding my hand and they're texting me

608
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,660
 and then I won't hear from them for 10 days.

609
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,540
 Or she's all about it and walking through,

610
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,060
 holding my arm at the mall and then it's like

611
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,400
 she went on a date with another guy.

612
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,820
 It's not honoring to God, it's not honoring to them

613
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
 and it's not okay.

614
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,700
 You bring clarity to the relationship

615
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,900
 or you dishonor them and you dishonor God.

616
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,340
 And I'm speaking to Christians who wanna honor God

617
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,180
 as they date.

618
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,580
 I mean, some of you guys are so confusing.

619
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,860
 It's like, this is what the person that you're dating

620
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,100
 feels like when they're trying to date.

621
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,140
 They're like, wait, wait, okay.

622
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,100
 Yeah, I'm like a sister to you, wait, what?

623
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,380
 And you bring clarity that they're not wondering,

624
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,100
 she's not wondering.

625
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,140
 Okay, so then you got the DTR and let's say Ben

626
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,500
 made that move, he's like, I want you to be my girlfriend.

627
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,740
 Beck said, I wanna be your girlfriend.

628
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,560
 They move into the relationship.

629
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,660
 This is getting exciting, we're getting closer together

630
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,480
 step by step, day by day.

631
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,000
 Okay, so then they're in the relationship.

632
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,840
 What does this mean?

633
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,180
 This is really important.

634
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,740
 This means they're in a relationship.

635
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,120
 It does not mean that they're married.

636
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,760
 In other words, they're still dating,

637
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,960
 which means they're still in the interrogation room.

638
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,580
 They're still where Beck's is going,

639
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,180
 hey, I wanna know everything about this guy.

640
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,900
 I wanna know, man, I wanna meet your mom.

641
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,940
 I wanna know where you went to college.

642
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,500
 I wanna know how much, what's your credit score, okay?

643
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,740
 How much you got in student loans, all of that stuff.

644
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,700
 You're in the interrogation where you're deciding

645
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,100
 who's gonna be the father of your children,

646
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,420
 the mother of your children,

647
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,220
 the person who will more impact your life

648
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,660
 than any other human on the planet

649
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,340
 for the rest of your life,

650
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,640
 who hopefully the next five decades plus,

651
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,780
 you're gonna spend with.

652
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,160
 You wanna make sure that you know their life,

653
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,420
 you're understanding them,

654
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,260
 that you're walking through

655
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,420
 and you're still in the dating phase.

656
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,220
 What's their job, what makes them angry,

657
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,340
 meeting their family.

658
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,760
 In this stage, you wanna make sure

659
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,860
 that you involve other believers,

660
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,160
 that you have other Christian community

661
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,020
 that are speaking into it,

662
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,940
 because here's what I know about Becca.

663
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,940
 I don't know a lot, but Becca has what is called a heart.

664
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,920
 And the Bible says a heart can deceive us.

665
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,500
 She can develop feelings for Ben,

666
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,240
 and Ben can be a jerk.

667
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,080
 Sure you're not.

668
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,360
 But Ben can be a total jerk, a terrible pick,

669
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,660
 not even following Jesus.

670
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,740
 And Bex could find herself still following love.

671
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,860
 So having other girls around who see the relationship,

672
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,260
 who see how he treats her,

673
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,900
 who are kind of familiar with her patterns to go,

674
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
 "I don't think he's good for you."

675
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,220
 Or to go like, "Ben seems like great, man.

676
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,780
 "He seems like a really solid guy."

677
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,240
 I'm so excited for this relationship.

678
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,880
 To have other believers in your life.

679
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
 For whatever reason,

680
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,520
 when it comes to making big decisions in life,

681
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,920
 most of us seek out counsel,

682
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,400
 except for in this one.

683
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,540
 The Bible says that plans or relationships succeed

684
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,560
 based on wise counselors or other people speaking into it.

685
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,700
 Proverbs 15, 22 says, "Plans,"

686
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,140
 or you could insert relationships,

687
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,900
 or you could insert plans to have a successful marriage,

688
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,820
 "Fail for lack of counselors.

689
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,380
 "But with many advisors, they succeed."

690
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,320
 Additionally, other thoughts in the relationship,

691
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,280
 you should not just be in community and continue evaluating.

692
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,720
 You should be pursuing purity together.

693
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,960
 In other words, not introducing sex into the relationship.

694
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,920
 Hebrews chapter 13, verse four says,

695
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,920
 "Marriage should be honored by all in the marriage bed."

696
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,500
 That means who you sleep with.

697
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,460
 "Should be kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer

698
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,400
 "and all the sexually immoral."

699
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,520
 And as they continue to date,

700
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,400
 they don't continue to move further

701
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,080
 into physical intimacy together.

702
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,900
 'Cause they understand,

703
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,880
 hey, that's for the context of marriage.

704
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,360
 So how far is too far?

705
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,560
 The Bible doesn't teach that that's the right question.

706
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,800
 First Corinthians chapter six,

707
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,760
 a verse we've taught a lot here,

708
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,060
 and it says sexual immorality or sex outside of marriage,

709
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,340
 sex with any person that you're dating.

710
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,720
 It says, "Don't try to get as close to the line as you can.

711
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,600
 "Flee from sexual immorality."

712
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,560
 So practically,

713
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,760
 if your body,

714
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,260
 if you find yourself with that person,

715
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,560
 snuggling on the couch, moving in certain directions,

716
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,980
 and your body begins to prepare itself for sex,

717
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,540
 you have crossed over the line.

718
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,560
 Do I need to explain more?

719
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,460
 If your body begins to physically prepare for sex,

720
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,900
 you, Paul, would say in First Corinthians chapter six,

721
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,780
 (imitates buzzer)

722
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,160
 Flee.

723
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,560
 Get up, honor her, I'm going home.

724
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,100
 Which is not, I mean, let's be honest,

725
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,720
 if you're attracted to the person, that can happen.

726
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,460
 But making sure I've got boundaries in place.

727
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,800
 Hey, we're not hanging out horizontal

728
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,560
 on the couch alone by ourselves.

729
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,060
 Doesn't, good things don't happen.

730
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:04,500
 Why would that be wrong?

731
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,260
 Let me ask you this.

732
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,020
 If you have a married friend,

733
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,800
 let's just go a married guy friend,

734
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,320
 you know, nobody married in your life,

735
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,920
 and he was touching the breasts or genitals

736
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,380
 of a woman in this room who was not his wife,

737
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,780
 would you think that's okay?

738
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,220
 Why would it be any different with you?

739
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,260
 She's not your wife.

740
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,660
 Just like she's not his.

741
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,320
 And God says it's not.

742
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,180
 In fact, biblically,

743
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,700
 and that goes both ways, guys and girls.

744
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,140
 Biblically, the Bible doesn't recognize

745
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,900
 girlfriend or boyfriend.

746
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,980
 It recognizes father or mother, brother or sister,

747
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,600
 wife or husband.

748
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,340
 The only fourth category for a relationship

749
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,040
 with a girl it has is prostitute.

750
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,760
 So are you gonna treat her like your mother?

751
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,560
 No, she's not your mom, your sister.

752
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,260
 Wife, she's not your wife.

753
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,900
 She's your love with sister and prostitute.

754
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,940
 Which one is he gonna treat you like?

755
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,740
 Which one do you wanna be treated like?

756
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,940
 The Bible says, answer that question.

757
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,840
 You could see in how he's treating you.

758
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,940
 And if it's wrong for a married man

759
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,180
 to touch the body of a woman who's not his wife,

760
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,540
 why would it be any more wrong for you?

761
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
 The Bible would say it isn't.

762
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,860
 So inside of the relationship, things continue progressing.

763
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,980
 But let's say they didn't.

764
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,020
 And Becca, they've gone on a few dates

765
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,260
 and Ben finds himself going,

766
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,820
 you know, this girl doesn't floss.

767
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,580
 I've got some problems with just the direction

768
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,660
 that this is headed.

769
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,540
 And I'm sure you do too, by the way, Bex.

770
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,380
 You have great teeth.

771
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,460
 She's got great teeth.

772
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,300
 Yeah, and.

773
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,940
 (audience laughing)

774
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,540
 But let's say he decides,

775
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,260
 man, this has been great for whatever reason.

776
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,300
 I don't wanna get married.

777
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,340
 I'm not ready to get married.

778
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,940
 I don't wanna continue dating.

779
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,540
 And although she's been great

780
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,460
 and she has amazing character qualities,

781
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,820
 maybe it's personal, maybe it's the timing,

782
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,780
 maybe he's moving.

783
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,060
 For whatever reason, he needs to decide to break up.

784
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,620
 And so he decides, I'm gonna come

785
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,320
 and I'm gonna communicate.

786
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,020
 And I'm gonna honor you even as I communicate.

787
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,820
 Man, I've enjoyed spending time with you.

788
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,720
 I don't see this relationship moving towards marriage.

789
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,760
 And so I'm gonna break up.

790
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,000
 If you don't see a relationship moving towards marriage,

791
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 that's your sign to break up.

792
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And so he's gonna do that.

793
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,840
 He's gonna come.

794
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,500
 He's gonna honor her and be gentle and tender

795
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,560
 and say, we need to break up.

796
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,240
 This relationship is not moving towards marriage.

797
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,880
 I've really enjoyed spending time with you.

798
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,400
 Or vice versa, if she's there

799
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,140
 and he's full send on Bex and Ben,

800
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,380
 he's got the wedding hashtag all worked out and everything,

801
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,880
 and she's going, no, I'm not there,

802
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,200
 she would say, I've really enjoyed spending time with you.

803
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
 Thank you for honoring me.

804
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,460
 Hopefully that's true.

805
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,080
 But I don't wanna continue moving forward

806
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,140
 in this relationship together.

807
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,600
 Philippians chapter two says,

808
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,720
 we do nothing out of selfish ambition.

809
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,000
 That I never act out of selfish ambition.

810
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
 So I go and I do that, not in the way that I want to,

811
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,080
 but in the way that is most considerate of her.

812
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,200
 And so I do that in person.

813
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,320
 I don't do it on a text.

814
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,720
 I don't send them a Snapchat.

815
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,420
 The way some of you guys break up,

816
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,360
 honestly, man, I don't even have a word for that.

817
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,680
 The word I would have, I can't say on a stage, so.

818
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
 Honor them.

819
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,100
 Do it in person.

820
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,240
 Send a message.

821
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,200
 You put the interests of that person before yourself.

822
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,200
 Some of you guys, you need to break up

823
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,400
 because you're in a relationship, you know is wrong.

824
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,280
 You know is not the right one.

825
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,480
 And you keep going like, yeah, man, he's amazing.

826
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,080
 And all he needs is Jesus.

827
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,380
 And you go, yeah, that's the problem.

828
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,440
 You're not Jesus.

829
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,020
 And your role's not to be Jesus to him.

830
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,000
 And you will not find Mr. Right

831
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,800
 because you keep dating Mr. Wrong

832
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,640
 and you keep staying with Mr. Wrong.

833
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,920
 Thanks.

834
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:15,560
 So additionally, as we break up

835
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,920
 and afterwards we take time to heal,

836
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,560
 that one of the worst things you can do

837
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,480
 is to jump right into a relationship

838
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,360
 after you've broken up, especially if it's a serious one,

839
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,600
 or especially if Ben and Becca

840
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,240
 had been dating for six months, a year,

841
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,980
 and you begin to ask God to heal

842
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,080
 and work through healing from that relationship.

843
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,560
 But let's say they didn't break up,

844
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,520
 or let's say they did and sometimes people break up

845
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,840
 and then they get back together

846
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,720
 and they move in to a more serious level of dating,

847
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,400
 which I would call the decision,

848
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,100
 where they are now gonna move to the next seat.

849
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,540
 And this is the time where your relationship

850
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,600
 is getting more serious.

851
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,500
 Some of you guys in here, we call it seriously dating

852
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,580
 or call it whatever you want.

853
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,720
 It is basically, you're gonna go heart of the hole,

854
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,320
 check all the boxes before you decide,

855
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,160
 I'm gonna marry this person.

856
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
 They seem like somebody who has the character,

857
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,320
 the characteristics, the type of person

858
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,480
 God says to look for.

859
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,880
 I enjoy being with them.

860
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,440
 And so I'm gonna do everything that I can

861
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,460
 to make sure that we have the same vision for marriage.

862
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,320
 I understand the hopes and dreams

863
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,040
 that he has for children, she has for children,

864
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,440
 that the future that we have

865
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,320
 doesn't not just unalign with each other,

866
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,840
 doesn't unalign with God's word or what God calls us to.

867
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,120
 And we're gonna walk through this,

868
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,560
 some of the final stages of dating.

869
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,400
 And this is when,

870
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,600
 'cause this question gets asked all the time.

871
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,160
 I'm like, hey, how do I know when to get engaged?

872
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,400
 This is the answer.

873
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,500
 When you have worked through these things,

874
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,000
 when you begin to go, hey, I've processed these questions

875
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,120
 and I know the answers

876
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,300
 and I wanna move forward with this relationship.

877
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,560
 And other people in my life encouraged us to do so.

878
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,400
 That you've walked through

879
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,200
 and you have checked their baggage and your baggage.

880
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,160
 That you've had conversations in this stage

881
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,080
 that are more intimate,

882
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,600
 where you're hearing about his wounds,

883
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,580
 how those wounds, father wounds, relationship wounds,

884
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,840
 baggage that he carries, how that impacts him,

885
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,720
 how he's worked through some of those things,

886
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,320
 sexual history, sexual past.

887
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,640
 You're having conversations about,

888
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,200
 hey, this is the type of future that I wanna have,

889
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
 the type of number of kids that I wanna have.

890
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,540
 This is some of the things that I feel God has called me to.

891
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,500
 This is the stage where if Bex is saying,

892
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,660
 I feel like I'm called to be a missionary in India

893
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,620
 and he's going, I feel like I'm called to be a dentist

894
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,980
 in Lakewood, you gotta get on the same page about that.

895
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,480
 And neither of which is wrong.

896
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,340
 But walking through like, man,

897
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,900
 here's what I feel like God is calling me to

898
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,420
 and having more serious levels of conversations.

899
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,540
 Is there sexual history?

900
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,800
 Do you have an STD?

901
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,480
 Is there baggage that you carry from your parents' divorce

902
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,460
 that you've never worked through?

903
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,720
 How have you worked through those things?

904
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,100
 This is why I love Merge.

905
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,020
 Merge is here in Watermark in Dallas.

906
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,700
 It's our premarital ministry that I highly recommend,

907
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,420
 especially if you're seriously dating

908
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,120
 or if you're in the seriously dating phase,

909
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,460
 even before you can engage, I think it's awesome

910
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,020
 because they force these conversations.

911
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,460
 'Cause it can be just kinda awkward

912
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,020
 to be like, out of the blue,

913
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,780
 so let's talk your sexual history and baggage

914
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,580
 or how many children you wanna have.

915
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,900
 And Merge or premarital counseling

916
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,700
 can often help facilitate those,

917
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,060
 help encourage and help lead through

918
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,020
 just discussing things that are really important.

919
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,540
 It can be done without it,

920
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,040
 but alone, it can be challenging.

921
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,260
 So I love Merge.

922
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,060
 If you're seriously dating, I would highly recommend it.

923
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,900
 It's on Wednesday nights.

924
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,380
 It's an incredible class.

925
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,380
 And you can find more at watermark.org.

926
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,980
 You can even, if you're listening in from afar,

927
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,900
 you can do it online or you can attend via Zoom.

928
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,040
 This is not the time.

929
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,460
 This is a myth that people have.

930
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,180
 In the decision phase, man, I've heard moms,

931
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,780
 moms from this group call in and be like,

932
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,320
 how could you tell my kids not to move in together

933
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,200
 with the person that they're dating?

934
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,040
 Here's why.

935
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,300
 In other words, there's a myth that in this stage,

936
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,740
 you should move in together so that you know

937
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,900
 if you'll be a good fit for marriage.

938
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,420
 Here's why that's a bad idea.

939
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,300
 The Bible, number one, and number two, society.

940
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,500
 Thank you.

941
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,780
 If that wasn't enough, society,

942
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,780
 even in psychology and sociology, says cohabitating,

943
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,580
 which is living together, before marriage.

944
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,780
 For years, we thought, man, that would have the likelihood

945
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,860
 of increasing the chances that they would stay together.

946
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,780
 And we're discovering it actually decreases

947
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,780
 and increases the rate of divorce by between 33 and 150%.

948
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,520
 That's on top of a 50% divorce rate.

949
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,560
 Those are slim odds, man.

950
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,820
 And that comes from University of Georgia,

951
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,940
 it comes from psychology today.

952
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,620
 You can just look it up, National Council

953
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,220
 on Family Relations, and here's why they've discovered it.

954
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,180
 'Cause it's really interesting.

955
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,380
 I mean, you would think, oh, you move in together,

956
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,180
 you live together, and you don't get married

957
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,380
 until you know, oh man, we made this work.

958
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,420
 We know how to live together, we know each other's rhythms.

959
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,100
 You would think that would increase.

960
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
 Nope, decreases, and here's why.

961
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,540
 This is really important, listen very closely.

962
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,540
 I'm gonna try to explain as clear as I can.

963
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:12,700
 The researchers say the reason it is

964
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,700
 is because of what they call the cohabitation inertia effect.

965
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,260
 Now, if you don't remember physics,

966
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,980
 inertia is when something is moving in a direction

967
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,160
 and it becomes really, really hard for it to stop.

968
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,540
 And whenever a couple moves in together,

969
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,460
 they begin to make life decisions that make it more difficult

970
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,300
 for the inertia of that relationship to break up.

971
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,460
 Distinct from if they were not living together.

972
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,180
 For example, they move in together,

973
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,060
 and it happens naturally.

974
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,260
 You're like, dude, my AT&T bill is so high.

975
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,500
 Oh, your AT&T bill is high.

976
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,060
 We should get the same AT&T bill.

977
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,820
 We're already living together.

978
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,660
 Then they decide, oh man, I need a cosigner on the lease

979
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,020
 for this Audi, probably not a good idea,

980
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,420
 but I need a cosigner, and can you do it?

981
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,820
 And now you've got a lease together.

982
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,740
 And then you see a dog, she's on her way home from work,

983
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,300
 and they have an adoption puppy thing,

984
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,980
 and she's like, look, I got Brutus.

985
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,260
 Hey, you're a daddy.

986
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,980
 And you're like, whoa.

987
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,220
 And now you got Brutus, you got AT&T phone bills,

988
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,600
 you got all these things that all of a sudden come in,

989
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,100
 and before, this is what the researchers say,

990
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,820
 before they had the ability to properly evaluate,

991
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:21,820
 is this someone I wanna decide to marry?

992
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,400
 They've already begun to slide into marriage.

993
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,620
 It's like with any subscription trial,

994
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,260
 I feel like this happens all the time,

995
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,780
 where people will say, hey, it's free for a week,

996
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,060
 and then after that, it's $10 billion.

997
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,860
 And you sign up, you're like, it's free for a week,

998
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,700
 this would be amazing.

999
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,720
 And then two weeks later, you're like,

1000
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,340
 still watching Ted Lasso on Apple+, wondering,

1001
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,940
 oh man, I think I was supposed to cancel that.

1002
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,500
 And you never made the decision, I wanna get Apple+.

1003
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,780
 You just thought, oh, I'll do it,

1004
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,360
 and then I can get out of that when I want to.

1005
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,540
 And then you look up and realize, I didn't decide.

1006
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,220
 I slid.

1007
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:08,380
 And that's what costs you about $15 in Apple+.

1008
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,640
 It could cost you 15 years or more

1009
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,180
 if you do that same offense in marriage,

1010
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,460
 where you don't go, man, I'm deciding.

1011
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,020
 I'm sliding.

1012
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:27,140
 And man, I've seen it so many times for so many years.

1013
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,300
 And the pain and the baggage and the scars,

1014
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,140
 because as painful as it is, right now you're 26.

1015
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,620
 And you end up marrying the wrong person,

1016
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,340
 and you divorce when you're 38,

1017
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,460
 you're not gonna be thankful.

1018
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,300
 And all the red flags that are coming at you,

1019
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,080
 and you're just going, oh man, but we got the AT&T bill,

1020
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,620
 we got so much of our life together,

1021
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,820
 I have so much relational equity, I can't just break it off.

1022
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,580
 I'm begging you, break it off.

1023
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,180
 So in this stage, they eventually decide,

1024
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:02,660
 man, I want to spend the rest of my life with this person.

1025
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,300
 I've been honoring, living separately,

1026
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,740
 and they come to a place where they're like,

1027
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,900
 I want to decide.

1028
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,140
 And this is probably the most practical section

1029
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,060
 of the message for the men.

1030
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,980
 Where Ben decides, I wanna marry her.

1031
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,500
 What does he do?

1032
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,740
 Number one, he makes sure that marriage

1033
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,140
 is within the near future, or on the horizon.

1034
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,020
 I personally don't think that someone should be engaged

1035
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,060
 for longer than a year.

1036
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,780
 There could be extenuating circumstances,

1037
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
 but here's what I know.

1038
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,020
 If you are attracted to somebody in dating,

1039
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,380
 if you are attracted to this person that you're dating,

1040
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,180
 you're gonna have temptation already.

1041
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,580
 If you're engaged, and you are like,

1042
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,380
 you, you boo-boo, and you're picking out flowers,

1043
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,740
 and you're like, oh man, we're holding hands,

1044
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,660
 I just can't wait to be old and wrinkly with you,

1045
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,620
 you're gonna have so much temptation.

1046
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,100
 You don't wanna prolong that

1047
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,700
 for any longer than you have to.

1048
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,740
 But let's say he's the one that's gonna be engaged,

1049
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,380
 okay, he's decided, I wanna do that,

1050
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,580
 I see marriage in the near future.

1051
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,420
 What does he do next?

1052
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,820
 He goes and talks to her parents.

1053
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,980
 Really practically, what if her parents are divorced?

1054
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,220
 Then you go and you talk to her mom,

1055
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,500
 and you talk to her dad.

1056
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,860
 What if her dad's not in the picture,

1057
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,180
 hasn't ever known her dad?

1058
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,420
 It's gonna be probably challenging for you

1059
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,020
 to get ahold of her dad, so I would go with her mom.

1060
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,020
 If you can't get ahold of her dad,

1061
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,180
 or there is some relationship,

1062
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,980
 I would ask for their blessing,

1063
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,620
 or ask for their permission.

1064
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,500
 Is that old-fashioned?

1065
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,380
 No, it's honoring to them,

1066
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,900
 which is what the Bible commands.

1067
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,060
 And so you ask them, hey, I'd like to marry your daughter.

1068
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,380
 I'd like your blessing.

1069
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,660
 Here's what I plan to do, I plan to honor her,

1070
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,580
 I plan to take care of her, and I plan to pursue her.

1071
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,540
 They may not be Christians, you're thinking.

1072
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,020
 They may not be.

1073
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,700
 Do you know what's gonna happen when they sit down with Ben,

1074
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,460
 and Ben's like, I wanna honor your daughter,

1075
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,980
 I wanna care for her, I wanna cherish her,

1076
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,540
 and I wanna love her and serve her for the rest of my life,

1077
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,820
 like Christ loved the church.

1078
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,220
 Even if they're not Christians, they're gonna go,

1079
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,580
 (sobs) I'm so proud of the family, man.

1080
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,660
 And they're gonna be so excited,

1081
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,420
 and you will have honored Jesus by doing that.

1082
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,900
 They'll see something remarkable,

1083
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,940
 and it's a chance for you to honor God in that moment.

1084
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,180
 So step one, make sure marriage is on the horizon.

1085
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,440
 Step two, you go and you honor,

1086
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,940
 as the Bible says in Ephesians 6,

1087
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,980
 honor your father and your mother,

1088
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,540
 and your future father and mother-in-law.

1089
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,260
 And then, this one I didn't see coming when I was younger,

1090
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,060
 so I'm gonna give it just for free, man.

1091
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,180
 Then you go buy a ring.

1092
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,660
 Now, you have never thought

1093
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,220
 about your engagement ring before.

1094
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,420
 She has, okay?

1095
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,780
 And you think ring, you think,

1096
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,380
 yeah, I gotta go get a diamond.

1097
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,060
 And you think diamond, you think just kind of

1098
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,960
 a little tiny rock that's crystal, like a see-through.

1099
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,780
 She thinks princess cut, and cushion cut,

1100
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,500
 and emerald cut, and circle cut,

1101
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,080
 and rose gold, and white gold, and silver,

1102
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,100
 and probably has some idea.

1103
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,500
 She may not, and so you just gotta evaluate,

1104
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,180
 man, who is your girl, bro?

1105
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,460
 Who is, what is she?

1106
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,020
 And what type of ring does she want?

1107
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,780
 Now, here's what I've realized about women over the years.

1108
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,940
 They talk.

1109
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,940
 And so, you don't know.

1110
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,140
 And my guess is, though, her friends do.

1111
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:06,060
 Or they have a weird Jedi mind trick,

1112
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,780
 sister, sister thing where they can be like,

1113
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,900
 hey, look at these rings.

1114
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,740
 I was thinking about it for me

1115
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,620
 if I ever get engaged someday.

1116
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,460
 Which one would you want?

1117
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,900
 And they just do that with their friend,

1118
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,340
 and then they've done intel for you,

1119
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,040
 and you're like, here's the one.

1120
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,100
 You're welcome.

1121
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,380
 So you wanna pick out, make sure,

1122
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,460
 if she's gonna wear it for 50 years, and she cares,

1123
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,540
 congratulations, you care, 'cause she's your girl.

1124
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,300
 In addition to that, that's step three.

1125
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,060
 So now you got the ring.

1126
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,420
 Step four, you plan a proposal that she likes.

1127
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,260
 What does that mean?

1128
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,980
 Some girls, you need to decide,

1129
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,620
 are you gonna propose to what I would call

1130
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,660
 the Jumbotron type, where she wants it on the game,

1131
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,260
 Jumbotron hit the knee in front of everybody, kiss cam.

1132
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,020
 Or is she the, I want it on the bridge, moonlight,

1133
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,820
 you know, walking, and then there,

1134
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,060
 and it's just the two of us intimate.

1135
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,700
 I don't know, but you gotta find out the answer,

1136
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,380
 and do it, here's why this matters.

1137
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,820
 The engagement is not about you.

1138
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,860
 It's about honoring God.

1139
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,860
 How do you honor God?

1140
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,860
 By loving and putting the needs of the other person

1141
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,120
 in front of you.

1142
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,120
 Finally, then you hit the knee,

1143
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,980
 and you pull the trigger.

1144
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,380
 So you guys, you move into proposal.

1145
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,380
 All right, then you're gonna hit a knee.

1146
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,940
 You're actually in this moment,

1147
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,380
 you're gonna put it on Becca's hand,

1148
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,460
 and this is a magical ring, all right?

1149
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,860
 Ben, show 'em how it's done.

1150
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,500
 Wow!

1151
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:35,540
 Kiss your bride.

1152
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,300
 Okay, no, sit back down.

1153
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,940
 I'm totally kidding, somebody gave me that ring,

1154
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,740
 and I was like, play around with it.

1155
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,100
 It's totally a fake ring, too, by the way,

1156
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,060
 I think from like, I don't even know.

1157
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,300
 Okay, so now you've done that,

1158
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,380
 now you've moved into marriage,

1159
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,020
 and this is where, so now it's done,

1160
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,320
 you're in marriage, you guys can move over to final seat,

1161
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,300
 and marriage is where really the most wonderful,

1162
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,500
 it's where the wonderful and the work take place.

1163
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,700
 As crazy as it is, everything that's been leading up

1164
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,460
 to this matters so much less than here,

1165
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,540
 and this is really when all of the different sin

1166
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,980
 in your heart, and you're gonna move in,

1167
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,860
 because as nice as Ben is, and as nice as Becca is,

1168
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,860
 they're two sinners, and when you put two sinners together,

1169
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,820
 and they've been selfish, and they've been living

1170
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,380
 unaware of how selfish and sinful they are,

1171
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,360
 and you put them in, and on that moment

1172
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,220
 where they marry one another, and it is the most amazing,

1173
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,740
 like marriage is incredible.

1174
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,740
 I wish every one of you would get married

1175
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,240
 and have someone to spend their life with,

1176
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,660
 spend time with, raise kids with,

1177
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,960
 have guilt-free sex whenever you want with,

1178
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,360
 and have an amazing future together.

1179
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,100
 It's amazing, it's the greatest gift.

1180
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,580
 My team, JD's engaged, and he'll get texts from me

1181
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,260
 all the time like, bro, I'm so excited,

1182
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,560
 I can't wait for you to be married.

1183
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,020
 It's amazing, but marriage is also hard work.

1184
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,780
 Why, because I said it takes two sinners,

1185
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:03,180
 and as nice, and great, and complimentary

1186
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,980
 as you think you are, you're broken, and so is she,

1187
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,260
 and you put those two together.

1188
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,760
 I didn't realize how selfish I was until I got married,

1189
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,120
 and marriage didn't make me selfish, it just exposed it.

1190
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,840
 Like when you're single right now, you can be selfish,

1191
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,960
 you can kind of have that stuff,

1192
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,680
 and you had a hard day at work, and you go home,

1193
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,480
 and you just get on Pinterest, and you scroll through,

1194
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,860
 or you get home, and you go to your room

1195
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,400
 and play Call of Duty.

1196
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,800
 You get married, there ain't no room

1197
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,120
 with Call of Duty you're going to.

1198
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,080
 You're gonna talk, and work through conflict,

1199
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,760
 and make decisions, and all of that's gonna come

1200
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,480
 to the surface, and through walking with Jesus,

1201
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,580
 we die daily to the sin, and the selfishness,

1202
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,880
 and that's constantly, and canonly, that's something

1203
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,060
 that for the rest of my life, I'll be doing with my wife,

1204
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,620
 and for the rest of your life, you'll be doing

1205
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,160
 with your husband, or with your wife.

1206
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,920
 In Ephesians chapter five, it says, the husband's role,

1207
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,120
 and we're about to land the plane,

1208
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,280
 for husbands, love your wives just as Christ

1209
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,520
 loved the church.

1210
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,320
 He gave up his life for her.

1211
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,880
 This may be the verse that I fail to live out

1212
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,280
 more than any other verse in the Bible,

1213
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,400
 and yet it is a verse that I am called to live out

1214
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,200
 every day and moment, that I lay down my life

1215
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,360
 for my wife, that I die.

1216
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,880
 It's funny, at marriage, something happens.

1217
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,820
 Bride, groom, they were standing here,

1218
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,560
 they walk down to what's called an altar.

1219
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,160
 Do you know what happens in an altar?

1220
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,680
 On the Old Testament, sacrifice, something dies,

1221
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,500
 and the day you and that person marry, you die.

1222
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,140
 And she died, and you're not two, you're not one.

1223
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,180
 And for the rest of your life, it is dying to the needs

1224
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,020
 and putting the needs of the person I'm married to

1225
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,820
 in front of me, for the rest of the rest.

1226
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,940
 It's where the wonderful and the amazing,

1227
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,540
 and also the work begin.

1228
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:55,540
 Okay, that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you get

1229
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:59,300
 from the ask out to the altar and after.

1230
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,740
 Can we give it up for our friends Ben and Becca?

1231
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,900
 (audience applauding)

1232
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,620
 Hey man, that was a great proposal, bro, you're ready.

1233
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,460
 Thank you guys.

1234
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,620
 Hey, let me close here.

1235
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:17,740
 Marriage is a really big deal to God.

1236
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,620
 He talks about it often, and just in thinking

1237
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,500
 and praying on and reflecting on how often he does

1238
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,780
 and wondering why, we're actually told the answer.

1239
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,220
 And by big deal to God, I mean, do you know the Bible

1240
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,580
 begins with a marriage, and it ends with a marriage.

1241
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,540
 It begins with a wedding between Adam and Eve,

1242
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,300
 God being the officiant, the first human relationship.

1243
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,740
 It's the very first thing we're introduced to,

1244
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,740
 Adam and Eve.

1245
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,180
 And then it ends in Revelation chapter 19,

1246
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,460
 chapter 21, chapter 22, and over and over,

1247
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,900
 it talks about the wedding of the lamb,

1248
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,900
 where Christ comes and returns for his bride, the church.

1249
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,740
 In fact, I'll just read it, it says,

1250
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,060
 Revelation chapter 21, verse one,

1251
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,300
 "I saw the new heaven and new earth."

1252
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,780
 Verse two, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,

1253
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,060
 with the people of God coming down out of heaven from God,

1254
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,860
 prepared as a bride, beautifully dressed for her husband."

1255
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:17,120
 In Revelation chapter 19, verses six and seven, it says,

1256
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,300
 "For the wedding of the lamb has come."

1257
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,920
 This is John, the book of Revelation is John

1258
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,580
 given a vision by God, and he sees,

1259
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,480
 and he sees all the future events that are gonna happen

1260
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,580
 at the end of time, and he says, "There's this moment,

1261
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,100
 and the wedding of the lamb of God,

1262
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,300
 who has come for his bride."

1263
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:37,000
 Verse seven, "In fine linen and bright, clean,

1264
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,500
 clothes were given to her."

1265
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,300
 And then in verse nine, "Blessed are those

1266
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,100
 who were invited to the wedding supper of the lamb."

1267
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,620
 It starts and ends.

1268
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,700
 Jesus' first miracle was at a wedding.

1269
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,700
 All throughout the Old Testament and New Testament,

1270
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,540
 this relationship, this marital language is used.

1271
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:01,780
 And the reason why marriage is such a big deal to God

1272
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,020
 is because marriage isn't about Ben and Bex,

1273
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,020
 it's not about you and your lover, your person.

1274
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:16,660
 Paul would say, the same as the Athenian Revelation says,

1275
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:21,260
 in Ephesians chapter five, he says, "For this reason,"

1276
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,140
 verse 31, "A man will leave his father and his mother

1277
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,340
 and be united to his wife, and the two will become

1278
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,500
 one flesh," talking about marriage, you would think.

1279
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,260
 This is a profound mystery.

1280
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,660
 What, the two becoming one?

1281
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,720
 No.

1282
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,000
 The profound mystery is that I'm talking about Christ

1283
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,900
 and the church, that the Bible says, ultimately,

1284
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,500
 marriage, why it's a big deal to God,

1285
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,860
 is it's not just a picture of you and your bride,

1286
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,980
 or you and your husband, it is a picture of God

1287
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,220
 and his unstoppable, unending relationship

1288
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,940
 with the church, his bride, and in marriage,

1289
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,420
 we're given a glimpse, a picture that points us to that.

1290
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,300
 This is really good news, because here's what

1291
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,460
 the bride of Christ is made up of.

1292
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,580
 It's made up of people who didn't earn their way,

1293
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,000
 or work their way, or clean themselves up,

1294
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,580
 and deserve to be pursued by the bride,

1295
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,300
 or by the groom, which is Jesus.

1296
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,100
 It's made up of people who've recognized,

1297
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,100
 I don't deserve it, I messed up, I'll never earn it.

1298
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,700
 And that's the first step, to stepping in relationship

1299
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,840
 with God, a relationship that for all of eternity

1300
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,600
 will be celebrated and will be a part of,

1301
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,440
 between the body of Christ and Jesus,

1302
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,740
 restored fully in relationship together.

1303
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,340
 And that's really good news, because here's what

1304
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,660
 I know about you.

1305
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,740
 I know it about you, 'cause I know it about me.

1306
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:41,620
 In this room, just like in this heart,

1307
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,100
 there's a lot of dating dysfunction.

1308
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,740
 There's a lot of brokenness in your past,

1309
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,100
 there's a lot of sexual baggage,

1310
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,460
 there's a lot of things, you look at that list,

1311
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,460
 and you're like, I did all of those wrong.

1312
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,260
 And I feel hopeless, I feel like, worthless,

1313
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,460
 I feel like I'm, it's impossible.

1314
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,980
 And God, and the message of the Bible,

1315
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,420
 is that you, in Christ, you're, dating relationships

1316
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:07,460
 may have failed, but in Christ, you are not a failure.

1317
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,780
 You may have made mistakes in your life,

1318
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,900
 but you are not a mistake, you are here on purpose,

1319
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,740
 God loves you, he created you, and he wants you

1320
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,660
 to have the most important relationship you will ever have,

1321
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,260
 which is not with a spouse, it is with him.

1322
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,700
 And that transcends any marriage in this world,

1323
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:26,580
 and it also is the point of every marriage in this world.

1324
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,780
 God loves you.

1325
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,900
 Mistakes that you've made do not define you,

1326
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,540
 and he, in Christ, offers hope and healing.

1327
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,780
 The story's not done.

1328
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,180
 And the story, ultimately, it's not about you,

1329
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,660
 it's about him, but when we take our story,

1330
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,180
 and we say, God, I'm gonna honor you,

1331
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,580
 I'm gonna seek to honor them,

1332
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,740
 I'm gonna walk with other people together,

1333
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:55,420
 we get to be a part of stepping into a marriage

1334
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,260
 that understands, ultimately, what marriage is about,

1335
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,380
 which is him.

1336
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,660
 Let me pray.

1337
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,220
 Father, I thank you that you have brought together

1338
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,300
 men and women who are dating in this room.

1339
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:18,180
 And I pray that the relationships that are honoring you,

1340
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,940
 not perfectly, but they're trying, God,

1341
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,940
 that you would help them, that you would sustain them,

1342
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,420
 that you would strengthen them.

1343
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,140
 And that if it is your will, that they would get married,

1344
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,660
 that they would raise children to know and walk with you.

1345
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,740
 We live in a world that is dark, and increasingly dark,

1346
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,660
 so would you put together warriors

1347
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,660
 who operate out of love, and who walk together in love.

1348
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,260
 I pray that you would break up relationships

1349
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,900
 that need to end, they would have the strength

1350
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,740
 to make that step.

1351
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,700
 I pray that you would move and stir the hearts of men

1352
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,660
 to ask women out, I pray that women would honor

1353
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,140
 in how they engage in that conversation,

1354
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,700
 and they would say yes on a date,

1355
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,340
 if it's an appropriate person that they should go

1356
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,220
 on a date with, and no if it's not.

1357
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,700
 And that you would prevent any guy from being a predator,

1358
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,100
 and that you would expose them,

1359
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,180
 and that we would find them,

1360
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,220
 and that we would do everything we can to protect

1361
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,700
 and facilitate and encourage people

1362
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,060
 to experience life in Jesus.

1363
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,460
 Thank you that you, through what you did on the cross,

1364
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,260
 have invited us into the greatest relationship,

1365
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,380
 ultimately what marriage is about,

1366
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,020
 which is with you, forever and ever.

1367
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,980
 We worship you now in song, amen.
