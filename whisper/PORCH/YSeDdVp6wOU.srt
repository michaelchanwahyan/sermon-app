00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:22,780
 Hey, guys.

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,520
 How's it going?

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,000
 [CHEERING]

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,280
 It's great to see you.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,780
 Awesome.

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,160
 OK.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,680
 All right.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,880
 Well, hey, it's good to be back in Texas.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,440
 My name's Ben, if we haven't met.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,960
 [CHEERING]

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,280
 I am the pastor of Passion City Church, Washington, DC.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,800
 [CHEERING]

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,760
 OK, you've heard of it.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,560
 Awesome.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,840
 Come visit sometime.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,080
 But part of the bigger family of Passion,

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,080
 led by my pastor, Louis Giglio.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,880
 And it's awesome to be a part of Passion,

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,720
 awesome to be leading a church in Washington, DC.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,600
 A third of the people who live in DC

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,600
 are between the ages of 20 and 35.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
 And so if you feel like you're just not meeting

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
 the right people in Dallas, there's

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,920
 a lot of single people running around your age back in DC.

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,120
 You live your life, but I'm just giving you options.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,240
 But I'll say this.

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,160
 I want to jump in to what God asked for us,

29
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
 because I'm excited about it.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,200
 But I do just want to say, it's always fun to be back here.

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,760
 The pastor of Watermark, Todd Wagner,

32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,000
 has been an incredible friend to Louis and to myself.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,920
 And come up several times to encourage me in DC,

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,240
 which has been amazing.

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,040
 And to see what David and his team is doing here

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
 is absolutely incredible.

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,800
 I think you really can, in Texas,

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,240
 sometimes get used to this, things like this.

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,000
 Oh yeah, several thousands of single people

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
 all get together and study and try

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,720
 to figure out what God's doing in our lives.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,760
 That's a normal thing.

43
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,920
 It's extremely not.

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,320
 And so just know that you're in the midst of something special.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,960
 And you're being led by some pretty remarkable people.

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,160
 And that's a gift.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,000
 It's awesome.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
 And it's fun to be here with you.

49
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,080
 So thrilled to be here.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
 Mike's here with me.

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,360
 And we just love being back in Texas.

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,240
 Haven't had barbecue yet, so that's kind of messed up.

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,560
 But it's great to see all of you.

54
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 So let me read to you a couple verses.

55
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,280
 We're in this series about moods,

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,880
 and we're gonna talk about one.

57
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
 And I believe God's gonna help us

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
 navigate a real issue in our lives.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,640
 And I'm gonna read you a couple verses

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,720
 out of Philippians chapter four.

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,040
 And if you've got a copy of your scriptures

62
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,480
 I'm gonna read along Philippians four.

63
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,400
 If you don't, just listen.

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
 I'm gonna read it, we'll pray, and then jump in.

65
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,400
 But Philippians chapter four,

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,880
 beginning in verse four, says this.

67
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,400
 Rejoice in the Lord always.

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,440
 Again I say rejoice.

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
 Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 The Lord is at hand.

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,280
 Do not be anxious about anything.

72
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,400
 But in everything by prayer and supplication

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,240
 with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.

74
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,720
 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

75
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,000
 will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,080
 Finally, brothers, whatever's true, whatever's honorable,

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,760
 whatever's just, whatever's pure, whatever's lovely,

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,200
 whatever's commendable, if there's any excellence,

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,120
 if there's anything worthy of praise,

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,400
 think about these things.

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
 And what you've learned and received and heard

82
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,440
 and seen in me, practice these things.

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,440
 And the God of peace will be with you.

84
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,600
 Now let me pray for us.

85
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,880
 Well, Lord, I wanna thank you for everybody in this room,

86
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,560
 whether they just love you and knew the words of every song

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
 and love singing 'em, or whether they're just really unsure

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,100
 if they can trust you and if this is worth their time.

89
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,360
 I think a lot of us in here are God.

90
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,320
 Anxiety is our reality and peace is distant

91
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,000
 and unattainable, but if the peace of God

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,300
 could land in our hearts, this would be a night

93
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,680
 that's truly special, and if the God of peace

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,440
 could sit with us, boy, the difference that could make.

95
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,360
 And so, Lord, rescue us from just attending a thing,

96
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,800
 but I pray even now you'd speak to us through your word.

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,180
 And I don't feel in any way powerful enough

98
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,440
 to communicate what I think you want

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,080
 in the lives of your people, so we're asking you to help.

100
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,140
 But I just wanna invite you guys, if you're willing,

101
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,720
 to take a moment and you talk to God

102
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,280
 and ask him if you're up for this,

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,180
 say, God, please teach me tonight.

104
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,640
 And then if you would, please pray for me,

105
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,280
 that the Lord would use me and I'd be helpful to you.

106
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:42,840
 Well, Father, we love you and we trust you.

107
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,560
 Use this time, and we pray that in Jesus' name, amen.

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,640
 Well, over and over again in the scriptures,

109
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,800
 we're told this one simple, beautiful truth,

110
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,720
 that you and I exist to know and enjoy God,

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,160
 that all things are made by him and for him,

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,840
 that in his right hand are pleasures forevermore,

113
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,320
 that nearness to him is our good.

114
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,160
 In this passage, it says, rejoice in the Lord always.

115
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,880
 I say it again, rejoice.

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,360
 You and I exist to pursue our joy in God,

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,900
 to rest and delight in his love.

118
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,720
 We are meant to pursue intimacy with the Almighty.

119
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,200
 That's why you're here.

120
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,520
 And I would imagine many of you in here know that.

121
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
 You go, I wanna know God.

122
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,660
 That's why I'm in a place like this.

123
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,600
 But if I was to ask you, you would say, intimacy with God,

124
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,440
 enjoyment of him is something I struggle to experience

125
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
 in the regular day.

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
 Why?

127
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,280
 Well, if we have an enemy, spiritually,

128
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,920
 and the Bible says we do, I would say his goal

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,680
 for most of us is not to convince you that God's not real

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,880
 or that God doesn't exist or pursuing him's not important.

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,400
 He's not trying to convince you of that.

132
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,140
 He says, if you wanna chase after that, man, you go for it.

133
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,120
 Just make sure you look good while you're doing it.

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,360
 And make sure you go to the right college

135
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,600
 and get the right major so you can get a good job

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
 and get the right internship so you can get

137
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,940
 on the right team and get a promotion

138
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,480
 so you can take over the world.

139
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,360
 But first, you gotta move to the big city

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
 and cities are expensive.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,640
 You gotta get an apartment and you need a roommate

142
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,120
 and you realize it's real expensive,

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,600
 so you need a lot of roommates.

144
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
 And now you got roommate drama.

145
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,320
 One just got married.

146
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,720
 (congregation laughing)

147
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,080
 But in the middle of all that drama,

148
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,420
 you realize, man, I gotta let people know what's going on,

149
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,880
 that I look good, and so I gotta look good on Instagram

150
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,280
 and I gotta look good on Twitter

151
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
 and I gotta look good on Facebook and on Snapchat,

152
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
 and meanwhile, I'm gonna be out here doing this

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,320
 and then I meet somebody.

154
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,120
 (congregation laughing)

155
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,280
 And we go on a date.

156
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,000
 And then we go on another date.

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,920
 And we go on another date and I meet their friends

158
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,560
 and I meet their family and they gotta meet my friends

159
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,920
 and they gotta meet my family.

160
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
 And then we're like, are we doing this?

161
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,920
 Let's get engaged.

162
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,840
 Are we gonna get married?

163
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,900
 And then we go on a honeymoon.

164
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,740
 Where are we gonna go?

165
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,560
 Where are we gonna live?

166
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,440
 Are we gonna live in the city?

167
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,800
 Are we gonna live in the suburbs?

168
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,640
 Are we gonna have kids?

169
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,520
 How many kids?

170
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,360
 Public school?

171
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,440
 Are we gonna go to private school?

172
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,280
 How's this gonna work?

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
 And on and on it goes.

174
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
 All right, all right, all right.

175
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,800
 (congregation laughing)

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,640
 And in none of this, at any point did we suddenly go,

177
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,680
 hey, God's dead.

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,480
 The scriptures don't matter.

179
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,520
 But just, we lost him somewhere along the way.

180
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,400
 And for many of us, you hear that and you go,

181
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
 well, Ben, what are you trying to say?

182
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,200
 Like, well, the trick is you gotta never have kids.

183
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,240
 You just gotta get 'em out of here.

184
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,160
 Is that what you're saying?

185
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,200
 Or you're saying, what's the deal, man?

186
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,560
 Or are you saying, what, am I supposed to just

187
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,200
 move into the hills and wear all linen?

188
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,080
 Like, what are you trying to say?

189
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
 I got a job.

190
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,120
 Like, what do you want from me?

191
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,180
 Well, let me say this.

192
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,180
 For many of us, our problems are not our major problem.

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,900
 It's our anxieties about our problems that's the problem.

194
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,420
 Let me say that again, 'cause it's important.

195
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,060
 For many of us in here, your problems

196
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,820
 are not the real problem.

197
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,140
 Your anxiety about your problems is your problem.

198
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,300
 That's what Jesus' argument in Matthew chapter six.

199
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,480
 He said, don't be anxious about anything.

200
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,320
 Saying, what am I gonna eat?

201
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,160
 What am I gonna drink?

202
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,980
 What am I gonna wear?

203
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,940
 He said, the nations do that.

204
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,420
 Those are real things, but don't be anxious about them.

205
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,340
 He says, but seek first the kingdom of God.

206
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,820
 And notice, he makes those a contrast.

207
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,260
 He said, you're either gonna seek God,

208
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,140
 or in your anxiety, you're gonna seek

209
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,260
 to handle a bunch of things.

210
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,540
 And Jesus presents your anxiety

211
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,980
 as one of your greatest impediments

212
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,460
 to pursuing your God-given destiny.

213
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,600
 Don't miss that.

214
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,380
 There's more at stake here.

215
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,420
 That your God-given destiny, who you're meant to be,

216
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,980
 is not gonna be reached if you are tied down by anxiety.

217
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,580
 And so one of the enemy's greatest strategies

218
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,940
 to keep you from your God-given destiny

219
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,060
 is to fill you up with anxiety.

220
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,860
 And for many of us, that's our reality.

221
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,500
 And what scares me about that

222
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,660
 is what Jesus warned us about in Luke chapter eight.

223
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,340
 As he was telling this beautiful story,

224
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,780
 he was talking about the word of God.

225
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,380
 And he says, let me tell you what I'm here to do.

226
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,260
 I wanna take the words of God,

227
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,540
 and I wanna plant 'em like a seed

228
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,780
 deep into the soil of your heart.

229
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,380
 And when they go in there, they're not just words on a page.

230
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,740
 It is the word of life,

231
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,860
 and that seed is gonna burst forth into life.

232
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
 And it's gonna become a big plant

233
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,780
 that is teeming with life and bears fruit

234
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,140
 and blesses others.

235
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,380
 That's what I wanna do in your life through my word.

236
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,360
 But he says, but there's gonna be threats

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,220
 to the word doing that in your life.

238
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,440
 And one of the threats, he says,

239
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,260
 when that little plant begins to grow,

240
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,900
 he said a weed is gonna come up and choke it.

241
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,660
 And his disciples asked him later, what's the weed?

242
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,940
 And he says, the weed is the worries of this life

243
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,500
 that many of us, if we're honest,

244
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,060
 you don't experience the power of God in your life.

245
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,040
 Your life really doesn't look that different

246
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,460
 from any of your coworkers.

247
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,260
 And the reality is you're not experiencing

248
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,860
 the power of God in your life

249
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,620
 because the word of life is being choked out

250
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,520
 by the worries of this life.

251
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,940
 And anxiety is keeping you from your God-given destiny.

252
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,100
 And that scares me for you 'cause God wants much for us,

253
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,620
 and this is a threat to us,

254
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,740
 and we're an anxious generation.

255
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,280
 Something about modern life

256
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,920
 is not conducive to human flourishing.

257
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,800
 We are relatively more safe

258
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,060
 than any generation that's existed,

259
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
 and yet anxiety is killing us.

260
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,820
 And that's what concerns me

261
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,700
 is it's not just missing out on what God has for us.

262
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,500
 Anxiety is a condition of the heart

263
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,980
 that brings forth many sinful states of mind.

264
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,980
 That anxiety about grades can lead you to be dishonest.

265
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,700
 There was a study at Rutgers of 32 universities

266
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,820
 that found that 74% of business students

267
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,700
 and 68% of all other students

268
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,620
 admitted to some form of cheating,

269
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,100
 which I don't know why business students

270
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,040
 were so much a higher percentage.

271
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,180
 I don't know if they're just more honest, you know,

272
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,780
 if they were like, "Well, of course I cheat.

273
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,500
 "That's how I get ahead," you know, or what?

274
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,320
 Anxiety about your schedule

275
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
 will lead you to break commitments.

276
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,940
 Anxiety about dating will get you to compromise.

277
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,540
 Anxiety about finances

278
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,420
 will lead you to make unethical decisions.

279
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,020
 Anxiety about being liked

280
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,500
 will lead you to embellish stories

281
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,160
 and act really weird at parties.

282
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,460
 (congregation laughing)

283
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,040
 Anxiety for many of us

284
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,780
 leads you to seek comfort and refuge in addictions,

285
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,660
 and those become a whole 'nother set of problems

286
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,940
 in your life.

287
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,980
 And then here's my fear.

288
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,860
 Anxiety, it will literally kill you.

289
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,620
 I remember when I was in college,

290
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,980
 I was taking a shower one day,

291
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,620
 and suddenly I felt like there was this pain in my chest,

292
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,620
 and it felt like someone was trying to like cave in my chest

293
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,820
 like I was having trouble breathing,

294
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,060
 and I was like, "What is going on?"

295
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,300
 I thought I was dying there in the shower.

296
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,020
 And I remember just thinking like, "Oh my God,

297
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,660
 "like what is happening to me right now?"

298
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,740
 And then I was like, "Is this heartburn?"

299
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,860
 Like I'd never had heartburn before,

300
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,220
 and I was like, "Was it the barbecue?"

301
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,180
 'Cause I'd been eating off the same plate of barbecue

302
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
 in the fridge for like a week and a half.

303
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,300
 And I was like, "Oh my God, like,

304
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,140
 "no, like what a stupid way to die."

305
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,980
 And I was praying, I was like,

306
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,300
 "God, I don't wanna go like this.

307
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,520
 "Like my roommate's gonna find me in the shower,

308
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,660
 "and then at my funeral, they're like, 'How'd he die?'"

309
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,820
 And I'm like, "It was the barbecue, man.

310
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,800
 "He just kept eating on it,

311
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,940
 "way past what was appropriate or safe."

312
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,020
 And I was like, "I don't wanna do that."

313
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,660
 But I made it out of the shower.

314
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,460
 I made it to a doctor,

315
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,100
 and he ran a series of tests on my heart,

316
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,340
 and he was like, "Hey man, do you drink?"

317
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,180
 I said, "No."

318
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,000
 He said, "Do you smoke?"

319
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,840
 I said, "No."

320
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,740
 He said, "Are you stressed?"

321
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,580
 I said, "Well, I don't know.

322
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,420
 "I'm not certain what I'm gonna major in,

323
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,740
 "because I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with my life,

324
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,580
 "and I don't know where I'm gonna go,

325
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,400
 "and where do I live, what do I do,

326
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
 "and I'm dating a girl, I'm not sure if she's the one.

327
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,240
 "I'm scared to stay with her,

328
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,080
 "but I'm scared to break up with her,

329
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,900
 "'cause I don't wanna be alone."

330
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,020
 And he's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

331
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,420
 "Okay, yeah, you're stressed."

332
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,740
 He's like, "Man, you need to calm down."

333
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,340
 And here's what's crazy about that.

334
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,580
 Preoccupation with hypothetical situations

335
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,000
 was literally killing me.

336
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
 And for many of you,

337
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 your stress about hypothetical situations

338
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,340
 is actually killing you.

339
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,140
 And it's not meant to be like that.

340
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
 And particularly for the people of Jesus,

341
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,500
 it's not meant to be like that.

342
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,180
 We are meant to be different.

343
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,420
 And let me say this.

344
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,180
 The world is not impressed

345
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,780
 when we sing about the Prince of Peace,

346
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,180
 but live a reality of stress.

347
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,420
 It's meant to look different.

348
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,140
 That's what Jesus was saying in Luke chapter 12,

349
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,340
 when he told his disciples,

350
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,940
 "Don't be anxious about anything."

351
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,660
 He says, "The pagans do that."

352
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,220
 He says that my disciples should be characterized

353
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,060
 by a lack of anxiety.

354
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,540
 So in the book, "The Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia,"

355
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,040
 which I know you've read,

356
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
 but by way of review,

357
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,020
 as it's talking about inscriptions

358
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,860
 in the ancient city of Phrygia,

359
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,460
 there's one where there's a guy's name

360
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,860
 that worked in Phrygia,

361
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,820
 and his name was Titideas Amirimnas.

362
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,060
 And scholars all agree that Amirimnas

363
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,140
 was not a normal name in that culture in that time.

364
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,540
 They say that was his baptismal name.

365
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,100
 That was very common in those days.

366
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,340
 They say, "When you got baptized,

367
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,020
 "I'm associating with Jesus.

368
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,780
 "I'm buried with him in the grave.

369
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,220
 "And when he rose, I rise into a new life."

370
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,260
 When you were baptized, they give you a new name

371
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,380
 that was a mark of, "I now belong to Jesus."

372
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,860
 So in the book of Acts, Barnabas,

373
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,000
 that wasn't his real name.

374
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,580
 That's the name they gave him later,

375
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
 son of encouragement, 'cause that's what he was like.

376
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,860
 And they say, "Titideas Amirimnas."

377
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,820
 Ah is a negative, like ah, theist,

378
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,700
 is someone who doesn't believe in theos, in God.

379
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,580
 Amirimnas means doesn't,

380
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,940
 and marimnas means worry about stuff.

381
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,060
 So literally, when he came to know Jesus,

382
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,420
 they said, "Your name is Titideas,

383
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,820
 "takes no thought of the morrow.

384
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,620
 "I'm not worried about stuff."

385
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,340
 That Jesus came not just to rescue you

386
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,500
 from sin and condemnation, but from your anxiety too.

387
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,860
 Did you know that?

388
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,460
 And there's some complexity in anxiety medically.

389
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,820
 I know that, and so I'm not gonna cover every issue

390
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,460
 that all of us are dealing with tonight,

391
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,640
 but I wanna show you a path that God has given us

392
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,420
 that's gonna help us live the life

393
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,420
 that God built us to live, and you got it in this text.

394
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,940
 And that's why in verse six it says,

395
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,460
 "Don't be anxious about anything,"

396
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,480
 or be anxious for nothing, which I love that,

397
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,740
 because there's just permission in that.

398
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,560
 There is no thing you're supposed to be anxious about.

399
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,140
 Can that just settle on somebody tonight?

400
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,140
 There is never a thing you are obligated

401
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,180
 to get stressed about.

402
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,380
 And by saying that, I don't mean

403
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,940
 that you don't care about stuff.

404
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,220
 I'm not saying that there aren't things

405
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,600
 you're supposed to carry that are meaningful and matter.

406
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,260
 You're supposed to, but that shoulder-tensing,

407
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,180
 scalp-drying, chest-compressing anxiety

408
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,940
 that you think you're supposed to just soldier

409
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,820
 through life with, God doesn't want you

410
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,380
 to carry what he gives you like that.

411
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,100
 You're not meant to carry it that way.

412
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,140
 The root of the word anxiety is the word

413
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,740
 to be drawn in different directions, to distract,

414
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,580
 that I can't focus on one thing

415
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,580
 'cause I'm caught up in many things.

416
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,660
 And many of us live there, and you're not meant

417
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,500
 to live there because that preoccupation,

418
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,980
 it impedes good decision-making.

419
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,260
 We're not moving forward in a healthy way

420
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,820
 'cause we're too caught up with anxiety

421
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,380
 about so many other things.

422
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,960
 So we're not meant to be anxious about anything.

423
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,300
 There's no thing we're obligated

424
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,200
 to lay up at night stressing about.

425
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,420
 But in everything, by prayer and supplication

426
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,420
 with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.

427
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,020
 Do you see the parallel there?

428
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,020
 Be anxious about no thing, but pray about everything.

429
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,600
 So anytime there's a thing in your life,

430
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,540
 you go, should I worry about this?

431
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,860
 No, nothing goes there.

432
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,660
 I need to pray about this.

433
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,480
 That's what we're meant to do.

434
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,320
 Now, before I unpack the specifics of that,

435
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,740
 let me just say, 'cause I know there's people in here

436
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,920
 that you're like, oh, okay, so I shouldn't worry at all.

437
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,380
 I should just pray more like that?

438
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,140
 Thanks, man, I got real-world problems.

439
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,160
 Like, hey, pray more?

440
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,020
 Just doesn't really feel like that's gonna solve it for me.

441
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,860
 But let me tell you something.

442
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,340
 Before you knock this theory, let me ask you,

443
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,800
 how's yours working for you?

444
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,900
 Before you slam on this one,

445
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,020
 if we were reading your text, what would it say?

446
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,380
 Be anxious about nothing, but in everything,

447
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,980
 just pound a lot of carbs for comfort, right?

448
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,820
 Like, is that it?

449
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,660
 And let me tell you something.

450
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,940
 I'm not knocking on you 'cause I get it.

451
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,380
 When I first moved to DC, a new place, new town,

452
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,500
 somebody was having a conversation

453
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,940
 with my wife and I about health,

454
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,300
 and they asked us, what are you eating?

455
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,700
 And my wife, without hesitation, was like, our feelings.

456
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,500
 And we were like, yeah, that sounds about right.

457
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,620
 Yeah, I get that.

458
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,180
 That you're nervous about something,

459
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,280
 you're not even thinking about it,

460
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,380
 but you're realizing, yeah, anytime something comes up,

461
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,580
 I don't take it to prayer, I just take it to the pantry,

462
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,500
 and that's what I do.

463
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,400
 And that's not solving things for you.

464
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,140
 Or others of you, when you have a decision

465
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,340
 you're stressed about, something that's uncomfortable,

466
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,340
 you don't know how to deal with,

467
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,860
 you just go for your phone, like, ah,

468
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,700
 and you just start flipping through social media

469
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,620
 and feed more of that insecurity

470
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,400
 and create a whole different set of problems.

471
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,360
 Or for some of us, to just numb the pain

472
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,420
 or escape into a refuge,

473
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,980
 we launch into all manner of addictions, we do.

474
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,420
 But it's interesting, I've read so many recent studies

475
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,980
 about how to cope with anxiety,

476
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,320
 'cause it's the issue of our day.

477
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
 And here's the fascinating thing,

478
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,440
 so many of these scholarly academic studies are saying,

479
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,800
 you know the secret to dealing with your anxiety?

480
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
 And they're saying things like meditation

481
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,760
 and practicing gratitude, that modern-day scholars

482
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,640
 are stumbling upon an ancient path

483
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,120
 that's been ours for centuries, if you understand it.

484
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,720
 And so I wanna show you the path God gave us.

485
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,320
 And before I give you the specifics again,

486
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,940
 let me just say this, 'cause I love the tense of the verb,

487
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,920
 I know, but it says,

488
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,120
 "But in everything by prayer and supplication,

489
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,680
 "let your request be made known to God."

490
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,460
 I love that it's in a passive voice,

491
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,440
 that it's not an active command, make your request known.

492
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,760
 It's passive, let your request be made known.

493
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,600
 It carries the idea that they wanna get out,

494
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,840
 you just need to let 'em.

495
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,640
 That for many of us, if we're honest,

496
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,480
 if your soul is like a tank of water,

497
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,920
 I don't know how you wake up in the morning,

498
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,020
 but I doubt many of us, it's just a calm, placid lake.

499
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,560
 I mean, some of you are maybe like that.

500
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,960
 When you wake up in the morning, you're like,

501
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,400
 (inhales deeply)

502
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
 (congregation laughing)

503
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,720
 A chance to worship my Savior, fantastic.

504
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,840
 (congregation laughing)

505
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,960
 And off you go into the world.

506
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,920
 For many of us, there's this whole world of stress,

507
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,160
 of loneliness and finances and conflict

508
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
 and dating somebody and not dating somebody

509
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,680
 and will I date somebody and status

510
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,320
 and all these things that are just waiting for us

511
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,440
 in our soul as soon as we wake up.

512
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,320
 And for many of us, they're there,

513
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
 and you go, "What do I do with these?"

514
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
 And what many of us do is rather than dealing with them,

515
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,480
 we go, "Hey man, I gotta get to work."

516
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,800
 And so what my secret is,

517
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,600
 is I just stuff them down deep inside.

518
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,560
 I just bury them down deep.

519
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,680
 And then when I get around people

520
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,840
 and they ask me how I'm doing, I'm like,

521
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,760
 "Great man, fantastic, it's awesome.

522
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,160
 "No, it's good."

523
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,320
 You show up in places like this, they say,

524
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,160
 "How you doing?"

525
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,000
 "I'm doing great, man.

526
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,120
 "God is good all the time, blessed.

527
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
 "Not today, Satan."

528
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,560
 All right, and that's us.

529
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,240
 (congregation laughing)

530
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,480
 And meanwhile, just before under the surface,

531
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,360
 we're wondering if we're gonna make it,

532
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,400
 if we're gonna break.

533
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
 And what I love about this text is it's telling you

534
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
 it's not heroic to pretend like you don't have problems.

535
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,080
 It's not heroic to pretend you're not concerned,

536
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,040
 and you're certainly not meant

537
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,520
 to stuff them down deep inside.

538
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,600
 What you're supposed to do is let 'em rise.

539
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,440
 Let 'em come up.

540
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,840
 And I love that it says, "By prayer and supplication,

541
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,120
 "with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."

542
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,640
 That word prayer is to create space with God.

543
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,440
 It's just a generic term for creating space with God.

544
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,160
 And many of you say, "Well, Ben, I'm too busy for that."

545
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
 Well, let me tell you something.

546
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 If we're honest, I think for many of us,

547
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,720
 we're not just too busy, we're inefficient.

548
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,040
 I mean, there's a statement in the military culture,

549
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,560
 sharpshooters, that slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

550
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,760
 That if you're trying to rush in shooting,

551
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,200
 you'll drop a clip, you won't aim, you'll miss your target,

552
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 and you'll end up being less efficient at your goal.

553
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,800
 And many of us, when we get up in the mornings,

554
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,120
 we go, "Oh, I don't have time to pray

555
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,280
 "and offer these to God."

556
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
 So you just carry them into your day,

557
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,720
 and what happens?

558
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,040
 You're inefficient in the way you treat people.

559
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,160
 That these things become the default mechanism

560
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
 by which you speak to your roommate,

561
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,380
 talk to your people, make decisions.

562
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,680
 That it's all being driven by this

563
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,560
 'cause you didn't deal with it.

564
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,200
 And so you're good at being busy,

565
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,760
 but you're not good at being effective.

566
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,800
 You're like an octopus on roller skates.

567
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,640
 Lot of movement, but hopelessness is setting in

568
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
 'cause you're not moving forward.

569
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,800
 And there's a better way than that.

570
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,680
 We're meant to slow down.

571
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,920
 Make it an appointment.

572
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,040
 For me, first thing in the morning helps with that,

573
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,280
 that I have an appointment with God.

574
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
 And so if someone asks me to meet them,

575
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,840
 I say, "I'm sorry, I can't.

576
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,680
 "I have an appointment."

577
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,280
 I don't tell them, "With the Almighty."

578
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,440
 They don't need to know,

579
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,240
 but I'm not gonna break it for them.

580
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,200
 That I'm gonna sit with the Lord

581
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,120
 and give myself that space to be with Him.

582
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,040
 And it says, "By prayer and supplication."

583
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,240
 That word supplication is more specific.

584
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,720
 It's specific requests.

585
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
 That I create space with God,

586
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,160
 and then what I do is I pull out a piece of paper

587
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,480
 and I write at the top of it,

588
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,640
 "How do you feel?"

589
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,360
 And you say, "Why do you write that?"

590
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,280
 Because I don't often know how I feel.

591
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,200
 I know that's confusing to some people in the room,

592
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,840
 maybe a lot of ladies that are very in touch

593
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,680
 with your emotions.

594
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,800
 You're like, "What do you mean you don't know how you feel?"

595
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,520
 What I mean is, I don't know.

596
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,200
 So I have to write it.

597
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,160
 How do you feel?

598
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,160
 And I'm like, "Uh, sad, confused, scared, alone."

599
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,120
 It's often a lot of negative feelings.

600
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,960
 And in that moment,

601
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,840
 I'll do what the psalmist taught us to do.

602
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,720
 Why are you downcast, O my soul?

603
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,120
 I'll start asking that.

604
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,840
 What's behind that?

605
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,160
 And before I walk out the door

606
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,240
 and start operating out of all those insecurities,

607
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
 I start letting them come up and go,

608
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,200
 "Why do I feel that way?"

609
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,720
 Well, I'm insecure about this meeting.

610
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,560
 Why?

611
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,800
 Because I want that person to like me.

612
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,640
 Why?

613
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,880
 Because I want them to give me what I want.

614
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,720
 Why?

615
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,640
 Because I can get to the place I want.

616
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,480
 Why?

617
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
 So that I'll feel important.

618
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,280
 Whoa.

619
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,280
 Business meetings aren't about making you feel

620
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,240
 like you're somebody.

621
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,920
 That's a spiritual issue.

622
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,080
 You don't need to carry that into that.

623
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,960
 And so for me, I've given myself the permission.

624
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,840
 There was a movie I watched in high school,

625
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,520
 like in social studies or something called "Madness."

626
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,000
 And it was all about different mental disorders.

627
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,760
 And I remember there was one where this guy,

628
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
 it was like way back in the day in America,

629
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,840
 he was building the railroads,

630
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,280
 and there was an explosion,

631
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,960
 and it drove a railroad spike through the front of his head.

632
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,840
 Yeah, severed his brain.

633
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,000
 But he didn't die.

634
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,680
 Hey, but it severed his frontal lobe,

635
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,080
 the part that conditions what you say or don't say.

636
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,960
 And so then they're reenacting his life

637
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,440
 of him going to get his job back,

638
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
 and he's like, "I want my job back."

639
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,520
 And they're like, "Sorry, man,

640
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,720
 "you had a spike go through your head."

641
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,000
 And he's just like, "That makes me so sad.

642
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,280
 "I'm gonna kill you!"

643
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,120
 Hey, you're attractive.

644
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
 What's your name?

645
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,780
 Wait, hold on.

646
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,620
 "I'm gonna kill you!"

647
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,200
 And this guy's all over the place.

648
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,600
 And that's how I pray now.

649
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,240
 I've just given myself permission in that journal.

650
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
 I'm not writing a memoir.

651
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,640
 And so many people in DC do that.

652
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,040
 They're like, "A lot of challenges today,

653
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,800
 "and yet I will overcome, 'cause that's what I do."

654
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,640
 You're like, "Oh, stop.

655
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,880
 "No one's gonna read it."

656
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
 (congregation laughing)

657
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,280
 Write it to God and say, "I'm scared about that.

658
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,120
 "I'm concerned about that.

659
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,020
 "I don't know how to feel about that.

660
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,860
 "I'm happy about that.

661
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,700
 "I'm worried about that.

662
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,540
 "I'm angry about this.

663
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,480
 "I'm insecure about that."

664
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,880
 Just let it rise to him by prayer and supplication.

665
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,400
 With thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God.

666
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,800
 And you go, "Why with thanksgiving?"

667
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,680
 Because you have the opportunity

668
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,000
 to let this stuff be made known to God.

669
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,120
 That's why what's amazing about that

670
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
 is when he commands us to do that,

671
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,720
 1 Peter 5, 7 says, "Cast all your anxieties upon him."

672
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
 That's a command.

673
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,160
 If you have an anxiety, cast it on him.

674
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,400
 And then you're told why, because he cares for you.

675
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,520
 And then Psalm 55, 22 says, "Cast your cares upon the Lord."

676
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,680
 Why?

677
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,080
 "And he will sustain you.

678
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,360
 "He will not let the righteous fall."

679
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,860
 I love it, the same command,

680
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,120
 but for two very different motivations.

681
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,000
 Cast your anxiety onto him.

682
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,840
 Why?

683
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,660
 Because he loves you.

684
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,040
 Cast your anxiety onto him.

685
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,880
 Why?

686
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,860
 'Cause he'll stabilize you.

687
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,280
 Cast your anxiety onto him.

688
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,100
 Why?

689
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,000
 Because he's loving enough to wanna hear them

690
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,880
 and strong enough to do something about it.

691
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,080
 He's the best person to take him to.

692
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,560
 You have permission to sit with the king.

693
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,080
 You have a father who knows what you need

694
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,160
 before you ask him.

695
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,320
 And it's a stabilizing thing to know that.

696
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 I remember when my daughter came to me one night

697
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,080
 and it was time to go upstairs,

698
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,800
 and I just picked her up to carry her upstairs.

699
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,360
 And she went, "No, I'm too heavy, Daddy."

700
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,080
 And I was like, "Uh, okay.

701
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,960
 "One, who told you that?"

702
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,400
 And then two, "You're not too heavy for Daddy, baby."

703
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,120
 And then I did like a couple presses with her, right?

704
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,680
 Just so she could see, like, you see what I'm saying?

705
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,520
 All right.

706
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,360
 'Cause whatever somebody told her,

707
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,360
 she believed that whatever she's dealing with's too heavy.

708
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,600
 It's not too heavy for me.

709
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,440
 And some of you are carrying some stuff right now,

710
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,340
 and let's be honest, it's killing you.

711
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,120
 Your digestion's not working right.

712
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,760
 You're socially bound up.

713
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,880
 You're not thriving in life.

714
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,900
 And the reality is you're trying to carry it all.

715
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,320
 And there's some things you need to carry,

716
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,840
 but you need to keep in mind that he wants to carry you.

717
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,520
 You got a father who wants to carry you.

718
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,060
 He says, "Don't be anxious, little flock.

719
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,140
 "I wanna take care of you and shepherd you.

720
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,060
 "You just gotta let me.

721
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,800
 "Create the space, be still, sit before your God,"

722
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,200
 because he's loving enough to hear your problems,

723
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,360
 and he's strong enough to do something about 'em.

724
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,000
 And he's offering you, "Come sit with your dad."

725
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,400
 And when you do, you get a promise in verse seven,

726
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,040
 "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

727
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,560
 "will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."

728
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,120
 Abraham Lincoln, there was a day during the Civil War

729
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,200
 where 76,000 troops were marched into Pennsylvania,

730
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,560
 and panic took hold of Washington.

731
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
 And as these troops marched that close,

732
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,120
 led by General Lee, historians report Abraham Lincoln

733
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,200
 had an eerie calm about him

734
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
 and was able to make clear-headed decisions.

735
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,040
 And so a general that he visited in the hospital

736
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,200
 that was wounded in Gettysburg asked him later,

737
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,960
 "How were you able to function

738
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,600
 "in the middle of all that stress?"

739
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,400
 And here's what Abraham Lincoln said.

740
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,600
 He said, "When everyone was panic-stricken,

741
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,200
 "I went to my room, got down on my knees

742
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 "before Almighty God, and I prayed.

743
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,940
 "Soon a sweet comfort crept into my soul

744
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,500
 "that God Almighty had taken the whole business

745
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
 "into His own hands."

746
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,040
 Now, did that free him up from having to make decisions?

747
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,440
 No, he's a leader, but it freed him up

748
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,040
 to make good decisions.

749
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,880
 Do you see that?

750
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,280
 Some of you, anxiety is just making you

751
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,880
 make really unwise choices.

752
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,040
 You're supposed to cast that anxiety onto him

753
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,360
 and be liberated to make wise decisions

754
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,640
 even in the midst of the stress.

755
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
 That's a gift he's given you.

756
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,120
 My peace will come guard you.

757
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,040
 It will stand guard over your heart and your mind

758
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,400
 so you can access your heart in a healthy way

759
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,680
 and think rightly.

760
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,280
 You're still gonna use these things.

761
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,320
 I'm just gonna protect them from the anxiety

762
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,280
 that's gonna send you running the wrong direction.

763
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,600
 That's the gift you're given

764
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,400
 if you'll create the space to sit with him.

765
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,880
 Jeremiah Burroughs, the old Puritan, said it this way.

766
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,800
 He said, "You don't pour wine into a shaky bottle,"

767
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,920
 which I just love that imagery 'cause you can imagine that.

768
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,120
 It's like, "Would you like a glass of wine?"

769
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
 "Sure."

770
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,800
 (congregation laughing)

771
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
 You're like, "Mm."

772
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,560
 He said, "You still the glass first,

773
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,880
 "and then wine gets poured in."

774
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,100
 He said, "God has blessings He wants to pour in your life,

775
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,120
 "but you gotta be still,

776
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,160
 "and some of us need to get this part right."

777
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
 He said, "It's like a child.

778
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,760
 "When a child comes to you asking for something,

779
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,320
 "it may be a thing you wanna give 'em,

780
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,760
 "but what are you gonna do first?"

781
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,880
 You want 'em to calm down.

782
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,720
 When they come running to you,

783
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,560
 "Can I have a snack, can I have a snack,

784
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,720
 "can I have a snack, can I have a snack?"

785
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,200
 Stop, stop.

786
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,760
 And you're like, "Hey, man, you gonna starve?

787
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,600
 "You ever starved yet?

788
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,280
 "Did I decide not to feed ya at some point?

789
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,600
 "That ain't even got some trauma?"

790
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,520
 "No, I'm gonna look out for you.

791
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,360
 "Just calm down.

792
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,820
 "Your stress about this dishonors me,

793
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,600
 "and you think I'm not gonna take care of you.

794
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,760
 "So be still, ask calmly,

795
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,420
 "because know your Father's heart delights

796
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,200
 "to take care of you.

797
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,760
 "Be still, cast your anxieties onto Him, 'cause He cares."

798
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
 Do you see it?

799
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
 For me, what I do in the morning

800
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,400
 is I have this little monitor I attach to my ear

801
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,880
 that measures not just your heart rate,

802
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,360
 but the distance between your heartbeats.

803
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,160
 It's to show, they call it coherence,

804
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,360
 just how calm you are.

805
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,760
 And when I start in the morning,

806
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
 it has this little reader on the phone,

807
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,000
 and it always starts red, which is bad.

808
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,440
 And you know it's bad 'cause of the noise it makes

809
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,280
 as it just goes, "Dung," which is kind of inevitable,

810
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,560
 like, "Too much stress, you know, like you're dying."

811
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,640
 You're like, "Oh, man."

812
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,680
 And so then I just sit there and breathe,

813
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,180
 let my anxieties be known to God.

814
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,000
 And as I do that, it's the most interesting thing.

815
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,140
 It's like, "Dung," turns blue.

816
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,680
 "Dung," turns green.

817
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,440
 I'm like, "Oh, okay."

818
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,840
 (congregation laughing)

819
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,880
 I got a clear mind.

820
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,280
 And what's crazy about it is

821
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,960
 that's where most mindfulness practices start.

822
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,200
 Stop, just empty your mind.

823
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,160
 That's only part one of a three-part move.

824
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,900
 You're not supposed to just sweep the house empty

825
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,740
 and leave it empty.

826
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,560
 You're supposed to put something in.

827
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,600
 And so that's why he says, "Cast your anxieties onto him.

828
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
 "I release my anxiety to him,

829
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,720
 "but then there's something else I embrace."

830
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,960
 That's verse eight.

831
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,160
 Brothers, whatever's true, whatever's honorable,

832
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
 whatever's just, whatever's pure, whatever's lovely,

833
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,200
 whatever's commendable, if there's any excellence,

834
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,480
 if anything worthy of praise, think about those things.

835
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,280
 And so I cast out of my mind my anxieties

836
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,800
 and I put into my mind holy thoughts.

837
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,880
 I release my anxious thoughts

838
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,840
 and I embrace his holy thoughts.

839
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,720
 That's what I do.

840
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,960
 I pour out my anxieties on that page

841
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
 and then I open the Word of God.

842
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,140
 And sometimes I write it out on that page

843
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,680
 and let Ben's anxious thoughts bend around

844
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,240
 his eternal Word.

845
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,400
 I put something in me.

846
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,520
 And what I've noticed is,

847
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,360
 is I think about these things that are true.

848
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,600
 What is really true?

849
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,920
 Let me not take God out of the equation

850
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,900
 when I'm thinking about where my career path's gonna go.

851
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,520
 Let me stop suddenly pretending like God's not real

852
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,400
 when I process who I should date and who I should marry.

853
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,020
 Let me start thinking about what is accurate

854
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,320
 about the situation I'm in.

855
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,760
 What is an honorable way to act?

856
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,600
 What is just?

857
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
 Start thinking about those things.

858
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,700
 And as I turn my mind there, it liberates me to function.

859
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,320
 Jeff Strucker's one of my heroes.

860
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,920
 Jeff Strucker was an army ranger in 1993

861
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,600
 tasked to drive the lead Humvee in the Battle of Mogadishu.

862
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,240
 The Battle of Mogadishu was famously portrayed

863
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,820
 in the movie "Black Hawk Down"

864
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,980
 where a small group of special forces

865
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,920
 were sent into the Somalian town of Mogadishu

866
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,460
 to pull out two high-value targets.

867
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,820
 It was meant to be a mission that was well under an hour.

868
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,500
 But in that mission, two Black Hawk helicopters were downed.

869
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,380
 The mission descended into chaos

870
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,940
 and it lasted not just through the day

871
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,380
 but through the night into the next day.

872
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,900
 Sergeant Strucker was in charge of driving the lead Humvee

873
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,100
 which was their exfil vehicle.

874
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,220
 And as he was driving it,

875
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,260
 they sustained their first casualty in the battle,

876
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,580
 his friend who was sitting next to him.

877
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,460
 But as the bullets riddled the side of his Humvee,

878
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,660
 he was able to make it out of the city alive

879
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,180
 and make it back to his base.

880
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,340
 And he said he got out and was just so thankful to be alive.

881
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,620
 And as he was there, like, oh my God,

882
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,460
 I can't believe I made it.

883
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,580
 There were literally thousands of soldiers

884
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,740
 surrounding them shooting and I survived.

885
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,060
 As he's processing that,

886
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,780
 his commanding officer came to him and said,

887
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,660
 "Hey, there's still men trapped in that city.

888
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,460
 "I need you to get in your Humvee and drive back in there."

889
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,620
 And he's like, "You gotta be kidding me."

890
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,260
 And then one of the other special forces men said,

891
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,280
 "Hey, before you do that,

892
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,200
 "you need to wash all this blood out of your truck.

893
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,320
 "It'll traumatize those men

894
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,220
 "if they have to sit in the blood of their fallen comrade.

895
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,820
 "You gotta clean this blood out of this truck

896
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,100
 "and then drive it back in there."

897
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,500
 And so he went to clean his friend's blood out of his truck

898
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 and he tells the story that he just freaked out.

899
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,720
 He said, "Panic began to struck me

900
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,340
 "and I just thought, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die."

901
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,100
 And he said, "It just kept going over and over in my head.

902
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,620
 "This is gonna be my blood, this is gonna be my blood,

903
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,460
 "this is gonna be my blood."

904
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,060
 And he said he was completely wracked with anxiety.

905
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,180
 And then in that moment, he started to pray

906
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,700
 and started to unload that onto God,

907
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,540
 his terror about losing his life.

908
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,920
 And as he unloaded that onto God,

909
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,620
 the thoughts started entering his mind of what's true.

910
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,660
 God determines my story, not my enemy.

911
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,260
 God writes history, not my enemy.

912
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,460
 And so if God wants me to live today, I'm gonna live.

913
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,460
 If God wants me to die today, I'm gonna die.

914
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,500
 He said, "If God lets me survive today,

915
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,260
 "I'll get to go home and see my wife and kids.

916
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,160
 "If God has me die today,

917
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,100
 "then I will go home to meet my Savior."

918
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,780
 'Cause he had faith in Jesus.

919
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,320
 He said, "But either way, I'm going home."

920
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,740
 And the more he focused on that, he said he calmed down,

921
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,700
 he was able to function, he got back in that Humvee,

922
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,460
 drove into danger and rescued men and drove out

923
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,020
 and then drove back again and again and again

924
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,860
 and rescued his fallen brothers.

925
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,700
 Why?

926
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,220
 Because he was practicing, I'm gonna release anxiety

927
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,780
 and I'm gonna take up what is true,

928
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,340
 what is accurate about who God is, what is honorable,

929
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,820
 what is the best way I could act in this work environment?

930
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,920
 What is just?

931
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,320
 What's the thing I could do in my office

932
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,660
 that fulfills all obligations to God and men?

933
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,500
 What is pure?

934
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,980
 What is the thing I could say that's not duplicitous,

935
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,100
 no false motives?

936
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,920
 What is lovely?

937
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,300
 What's a way to act that would be beautiful

938
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,140
 to people in the room?

939
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,180
 What is commendable?

940
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,240
 What's the kind of way I could make decisions

941
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,820
 that people would write books about?

942
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,140
 Saying that's the way to live life,

943
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,100
 that I don't condescend to the least common denominator

944
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,300
 of my culture, but I rise into the status of heroes

945
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,060
 in the way I conduct my story.

946
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,340
 How could I live like that?

947
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,660
 That if there's anything excellent or worthy of praise,

948
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,140
 I'm gonna think about those things.

949
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,140
 That's why I read a lot of biographies,

950
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,300
 'cause I don't wanna just react to my culture.

951
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,180
 I wanna read the stories of men and women

952
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,300
 who lived great lives and approximate my life to them.

953
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,500
 I wanna dwell on beautiful, commendable things,

954
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,540
 'cause I wanna be like 'em.

955
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,900
 That I cast my anxiety onto him,

956
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,120
 and I take his thoughts into me.

957
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,660
 I release anxiety, and I embrace the word of God,

958
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,540
 and I let it change me, because every good decision

959
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,460
 is first preceded by a good thought,

960
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,740
 bolstered by a courageous heart.

961
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,280
 And as good thoughts are plugged in,

962
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,700
 and a courageous heart feeds 'em, good decisions are made.

963
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,900
 So what I'm talking about here is the way you live

964
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,260
 a good life, a heroic life, a worthy life.

965
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,620
 It starts here in this lab.

966
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,140
 And so I wanna do this.

967
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,940
 And not only do I wanna read his word, verse nine,

968
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,100
 says, "In what you have learned and received

969
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,360
 "and heard and seen in me, practice these things,

970
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,900
 "and the God of peace will be with you."

971
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,740
 I love that.

972
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,660
 He says, "I don't want you to just read about it.

973
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,560
 "I want you to walk in it.

974
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,840
 "I want you to release anxiety.

975
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,940
 "I want you to embrace my thoughts,

976
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,940
 "and then I want you to excel at the revealed things."

977
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,180
 So often we wanna know God's unrevealed will.

978
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,660
 And he says, "I'm not gonna tell you."

979
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,500
 And then we stress about his job.

980
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,460
 He's like, "Let me do my job.

981
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,860
 "I've given you yours.

982
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,400
 "I've shown you, oh man, what is good,

983
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,300
 "what the Lord requires of you.

984
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,020
 "Love justice, walk humbly with your God.

985
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,260
 "He's told us, so I'm gonna get great

986
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,520
 "at the revealed things."

987
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,220
 So when I left college, it was a jarring experience.

988
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,260
 I know many of you have had that,

989
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,220
 where education keeps you on some rails,

990
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,820
 and then it's just like the rails end,

991
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,500
 and your little train just goes off a cliff and free floats.

992
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,660
 And you're like, "This feels bad."

993
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,220
 You know, and you're like, "Where's my life going?"

994
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,540
 And for me, I became a youth pastor.

995
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,620
 I'd never had a youth pastor.

996
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,300
 Didn't know what one did.

997
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,860
 And so I remember I showed up there,

998
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,700
 and I was like, "What do you do?"

999
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,660
 And someone said, "Well, you gotta go ask good youth pastors."

1000
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,300
 So I went and met with great youth pastors all around Texas,

1001
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,500
 and all of them had youth ministries about this size,

1002
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,580
 and they were saying things to me like,

1003
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,420
 "Well, when you hire your seventh middle school videographer,"

1004
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,260
 and stuff like that.

1005
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,100
 And I'm like, "Wait, what?"

1006
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
 Because I had a ministry of six kids

1007
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,740
 that after a few months, I had grown to one kid.

1008
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,100
 And I was like, "Man, what?"

1009
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,140
 And so they're talking about how to build an empire

1010
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,780
 like this, and it was overwhelming.

1011
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,520
 Now, granted, I wasn't doing much,

1012
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,900
 but the thought of trying to take my little

1013
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,220
 and make it big was too much.

1014
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,060
 I couldn't handle it.

1015
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,780
 I freaked out, and I quit, like a month in.

1016
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,500
 I felt really bad about that,

1017
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,260
 so I like unquit two days later.

1018
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,660
 (congregation laughing)

1019
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,140
 But I was like, "I literally don't know

1020
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,260
 "what I'm doing with my life.

1021
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,440
 "I don't even know what I'm doing here.

1022
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,120
 "I don't even know if I wanna be a youth pastor.

1023
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,960
 "Somebody help me."

1024
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
 And I remember a mentor telling me,

1025
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,060
 "Ben, you gotta figure out why you exist,

1026
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,660
 "why it's Ben on the planet."

1027
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,500
 And I just came back to the simple truth.

1028
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,520
 All things are made by him and for him.

1029
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,620
 I'm made for him.

1030
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,040
 What's the greatest commandment?

1031
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,740
 To love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind.

1032
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,420
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

1033
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,820
 So I would put that in my calendar.

1034
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,620
 If my first reason Ben exists is to know and love God,

1035
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,620
 then I'm gonna do that every day.

1036
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,220
 That's the first thing that lands in my calendar.

1037
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,940
 And for me, the screens in my life were a distraction,

1038
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,860
 so I got rid of my TV.

1039
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,020
 'Cause I realized my God has talked to me,

1040
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,300
 and I had never read most of what he had to say.

1041
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,140
 I'm gonna change that.

1042
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,160
 And I just wanted to get near him.

1043
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,220
 And then I wanted to make him known.

1044
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,300
 And what's that gonna look like?

1045
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,740
 Well, for me, it was pretty easy at first.

1046
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,580
 It was just one kid.

1047
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,740
 I'm like, "Austin, how you doing, man?"

1048
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,780
 And I'd talk to him, and then we grew it back

1049
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,380
 to five, six kids, and I had this little youth ministry

1050
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,100
 full of punks, in a technical sense.

1051
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,300
 You know, they wore all black and safety pins and whatnot.

1052
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,380
 And we would sit at Taco Bell and talk.

1053
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,460
 It wasn't stuff like this.

1054
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,660
 I didn't need a microphone.

1055
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,300
 It was just all like, "All right, guys, can you scooch?

1056
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,580
 "All right, gather in."

1057
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,940
 And I was like, "I'm gonna make God known

1058
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,220
 "to these six kids."

1059
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,060
 And I would just do that.

1060
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,420
 And I didn't really know how to build.

1061
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,340
 I just wanted to be faithful at what he gave me to do.

1062
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,820
 And as I was faithful with the little things,

1063
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,500
 he taught me more things.

1064
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,660
 And as I was faithful with those things,

1065
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,500
 he gave me more things.

1066
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,820
 And over the course of my life,

1067
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,460
 I haven't known so much of what's coming,

1068
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,540
 but I feel like I'm living a pretty great story.

1069
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,900
 Because I don't know a lot, but I know him.

1070
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,620
 And I trust him.

1071
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,900
 And so I'm not gonna let anxiety wreck me,

1072
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,220
 but I'm gonna let his word dwell richly in me,

1073
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,980
 and then I'm gonna let my feet walk wherever he leads.

1074
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,060
 And I wanna be excellent what is good,

1075
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,780
 and I wanna be innocent of evil.

1076
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,140
 Because when I do that, not only is the peace of God

1077
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,940
 with me, the God of peace is with me.

1078
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,140
 Isn't that great?

1079
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,580
 I love that parallel at the end.

1080
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,300
 It's not just that I wanna put my peace in your heart

1081
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,580
 to guard you, the very God of peace steps into your story

1082
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,300
 and says, "I'm gonna be with you.

1083
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,100
 "I'm gonna stand with you.

1084
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,140
 "I'm here with you in Dallas.

1085
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,980
 "I'm here with you in that apartment.

1086
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,900
 "Now your family's not here anymore, but I'm here.

1087
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,860
 "Now that person is out of your life,

1088
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,820
 "but the maker of the stars knows your name,

1089
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,540
 "and he hasn't lost sight of you.

1090
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,140
 "There's purpose in your life.

1091
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,380
 "Live into that.

1092
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,500
 "Walk with him.

1093
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,260
 "There's a beautiful peace there."

1094
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,180
 John Patton is another one of my heroes.

1095
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,540
 John Patton was a missionary in the 1800s

1096
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,300
 that sailed to the New Hebrides,

1097
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,900
 a little island that was filled with cannibals.

1098
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,940
 And people warned him when he left Scotland to go there.

1099
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,060
 They were like, "Cannibals, John!

1100
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,180
 "You're gonna be eaten by cannibals!"

1101
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,580
 And his response was, "Well, sir, you're advanced in age,

1102
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,700
 "soon to be eaten by worms."

1103
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,620
 (congregation laughing)

1104
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,540
 So whether I'm eaten by worms or cannibals

1105
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,340
 doesn't really matter for me.

1106
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,500
 I just wanna be faithful.

1107
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
 It's a pretty cool answer.

1108
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,660
 But then when he got there,

1109
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,420
 his new adventure in life's pretty stressful.

1110
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,740
 I mean, you read his biography, it's like an action movie.

1111
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,580
 They should make it a movie.

1112
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
 Like he's literally, people are trying to kill him

1113
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,740
 like always.

1114
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,140
 And so he's literally out there like,

1115
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,740
 "Hey, I was thinking the other day,

1116
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,900
 "like dodging axes and people coming at him."

1117
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,820
 There was one point where they had surrounded

1118
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,180
 his little hut and were about to murder him.

1119
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,620
 He realized, "I can't escape."

1120
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,980
 And so he's like, "I don't even know what to do."

1121
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,500
 So he prayed and trust God, opened the door and walked out

1122
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,780
 and rebuked them for inhospitality.

1123
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,860
 He's like, "You know what, guys?

1124
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,140
 "Frankly, all this murder is rude, okay?

1125
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,940
 "Not cool."

1126
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,940
 And he said, they were kind of like, "Wait, what?"

1127
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,060
 And then it got like, it messed with him.

1128
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,980
 They were like, "Yeah, sorry, man.

1129
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,420
 "That's weird, yeah, no."

1130
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,260
 And then he's right.

1131
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,100
 I mean, he's right.

1132
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,100
 And then they told him, "From now on,

1133
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,100
 "we're gonna kill for you."

1134
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,620
 And he's like, "Well, no, that's not, you know what?

1135
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,140
 "Okay, that's a step, let's start there."

1136
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,060
 And he just lived a crazy story.

1137
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:35,420
 By the end of his story, an entire island that had,

1138
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,780
 he said, been held captive by fear of animism

1139
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,020
 was terrified of angry and capricious demons

1140
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,540
 that were cruel to children and would murder women.

1141
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,620
 He said he got to a situation where they realized,

1142
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,020
 no, the heavens aren't angry with you,

1143
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,460
 there's a God that loves you.

1144
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,340
 No, the gods aren't making you sacrifice

1145
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,140
 your women and children to them.

1146
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,940
 Your God gave his son for you.

1147
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,220
 And your God wants to do something beautiful in your life,

1148
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,540
 not to hold you captive by fear,

1149
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,340
 but to set you free to walk in the liberty

1150
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,060
 of the sons and daughters of God.

1151
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,180
 That's why his son came, to live the perfect life you can't,

1152
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,220
 to be the sacrifice for you that you need,

1153
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,900
 so you can be welcomed home,

1154
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,300
 not trying to earn the favor of your God,

1155
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,340
 but resting in the fact that you have it.

1156
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,820
 And there was one night on his journey

1157
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,780
 when it was still very uncertain that he found out again

1158
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,340
 people were coming to kill him.

1159
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,900
 A group of men that he didn't particularly trust

1160
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,700
 told him about it and told him you had to flee,

1161
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,940
 and they pointed out a tree for him to climb.

1162
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,900
 And he wrote in his autobiography,

1163
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,180
 being entirely at the mercy of such doubtful

1164
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,700
 and vacillating friends,

1165
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,980
 I, though perplexed, felt it best to obey.

1166
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,260
 I climbed into the tree

1167
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,140
 and was left there alone in the bush.

1168
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,220
 The hours I spent there live all before me

1169
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,460
 as if it were yesterday.

1170
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,020
 I heard the frequent discharging of muskets

1171
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,620
 and the yells of the savages.

1172
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,780
 Yet I sat there among the branches,

1173
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,220
 as safe as in the very arms of Jesus.

1174
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,660
 Never in all my sorrows did my Lord draw nearer to me

1175
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,820
 and speak more soothingly in my soul

1176
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,180
 than when the moonlight flickered

1177
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,380
 among those chestnut leaves

1178
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,100
 and the night air played on my throbbing brow

1179
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,700
 as I told all of my heart to Jesus.

1180
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,620
 Alone yet not alone.

1181
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,860
 If it be to glorify my God,

1182
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,980
 I would not grudge to spend many times alone in such a tree.

1183
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,260
 To feel again my Savior's presence,

1184
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,740
 to enjoy his consoling fellowship.

1185
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,580
 And then he asks us a question.

1186
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,180
 If thus thrown back upon your own soul,

1187
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,420
 alone, all alone in the midnight, in the wild,

1188
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,860
 in the very embrace of death,

1189
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,620
 do you have a friend who will not fail you then?

1190
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,140
 The answer is you do.

1191
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,740
 Jesus said, "Don't be anxious.

1192
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,940
 "The world does that.

1193
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,540
 "Your Father knows what you need.

1194
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,020
 "So don't worry, my little flock.

1195
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,340
 "God delights to give you the kingdom."

1196
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,900
 So you got a rescuer who's come for you.

1197
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,620
 You're not alone.

1198
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,620
 You got a God who sees you.

1199
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,460
 You're not alone.

1200
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,740
 And there's an invitation before us today

1201
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,980
 to put the anxiety down and to rest

1202
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,580
 in an inexhaustible and unfailing love

1203
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,500
 of a God who knows you and he cares

1204
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,100
 and is strong enough to carry you if you'll let him.

1205
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,100
 Father, I wanna thank you

1206
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:43,820
 that you don't lie to us about the fact that life is hard.

1207
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,660
 In this world, you will have trouble,

1208
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:52,780
 but we take heart 'cause you've overcome the world.

1209
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,740
 And God, I believe there's some people in this room

1210
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,700
 that their whole life has been about,

1211
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,420
 I gotta carry my own self,

1212
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,660
 pull myself up by my own bootstraps,

1213
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,700
 carry my own weight.

1214
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,900
 I got broad shoulders.

1215
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,740
 I can handle it.

1216
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,580
 I can do it.

1217
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,860
 My parents weren't there for me, but I'm there for me.

1218
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,900
 Nobody's looking out for me, but I'm looking out for me.

1219
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,700
 And you've done that, but how long?

1220
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,780
 And you know in the stillness of the night,

1221
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,100
 that's not how you're meant to live.

1222
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,940
 There's something better.

1223
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,500
 Yes, you are meant to carry great things,

1224
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,380
 but you are meant to be carried by the great one.

1225
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,780
 And as Jack said earlier, that's why Jesus came.

1226
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,180
 To be the perfection you're not.

1227
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,260
 To be the perfection you're not.

1228
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,300
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1229
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1230
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,340
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1231
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,380
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1232
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,380
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1233
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,420
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1234
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,380
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1235
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,420
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1236
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,460
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1237
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,500
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1238
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,540
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1239
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,500
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1240
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,460
 And to be the perfection you're not.

1241
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,100
 If the offer on the table is to know God as a father,

1242
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,380
 a loving father, not an imperfect one like my earthly one,

1243
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,420
 but a perfect one,

1244
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,940
 then I want God to be a dad like that.

1245
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,300
 And if you're feeling him call you,

1246
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,540
 I just want you to say yes.

1247
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,460
 I just want you to put your faith in him, to tell him yes.

1248
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,780
 Even now while you're sitting there,

1249
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,700
 if that's you say yes God, I want in.

1250
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,780
 Bring me into your family by your grace.

1251
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,200
 (soft music)

1252
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:42,740
 And look, I can't see most of you,

1253
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,580
 but I wonder if, well every heads down and eyes closed,

1254
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,140
 if that's you and you're saying I wanna come home,

1255
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,540
 I wanna put my faith in Jesus,

1256
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,860
 would you put a hand up for me?

1257
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,420
 Some of you I'll be able to see, some I won't.

1258
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,660
 But it's more about you and God.

1259
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,860
 Okay, I see a lot of them.

1260
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,860
 All right, all right.

1261
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,900
 Man, okay.

1262
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,020
 Amazing.

1263
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,220
 It's incredible.

1264
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,060
 Praise God.

1265
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:11,900
 Anybody wanna just tell him, me God,

1266
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,180
 you see me and I see you and I'm coming home.

1267
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,620
 Well, if that's you and you put a hand up,

1268
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,020
 you just tell him thank you.

1269
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,820
 Thank you for sending your son to come get me.

1270
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,180
 I believe it.

1271
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,500
 And I receive it.

1272
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,340
 I believe it.

1273
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,940
 And then for those of us who know him,

1274
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,780
 and even if you don't, the invitation's on the table tonight

1275
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,860
 and here's the thing, I don't want you to leave here

1276
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,700
 and maybe at some point get around

1277
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,580
 to casting your cares upon him.

1278
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,560
 We got a moment here and we're about to leave,

1279
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,580
 but just if you can hang in.

1280
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,140
 I just don't wanna leave the space

1281
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,540
 and miss out on a moment right now.

1282
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,600
 To not say I'll cast my cares on him someday,

1283
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,980
 but even now, you just got some space here.

1284
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,260
 You got some quiet.

1285
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,680
 And I wonder if across this room,

1286
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,780
 we'd be willing to just open up empty hands

1287
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,020
 and say this is it for me, God.

1288
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,980
 I know you know what it is,

1289
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,140
 but it's helpful for me to just say it.

1290
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,500
 I'm anxious about this.

1291
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,380
 I'm scared about that.

1292
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,020
 I'm uncertain about this.

1293
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,220
 And I don't want that anxiety to drive me.

1294
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,700
 So I'm trusting you, I'm believing you,

1295
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,020
 and I'm gonna do it tonight.

1296
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,000
 I know I'm gonna get one thing right today,

1297
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,840
 if nothing else.

1298
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,980
 I'm gonna do what your word says

1299
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,100
 and I'm just gonna cast this on you

1300
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,780
 and believe that you're there and you care.

1301
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,500
 Band's gonna lead us in a minute

1302
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,600
 and they're gonna sing and for some of us,

1303
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,460
 right away, you're gonna wanna rise up

1304
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,580
 'cause what they're singing is gonna be

1305
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,400
 the cry of your heart.

1306
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
 You sing it out, brother, and you cry out, sister.

1307
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,060
 Others of us, you're gonna need a minute

1308
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,900
 to just sit and keep pouring out your heart

1309
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,860
 and you just do that.

1310
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,500
 When you're ready to sing, you sing along,

1311
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,620
 but let's just have a moment here

1312
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,460
 where we meet with God.

1313
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,660
 Don't let it pass us by.

1314
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,020
 (congregation murmuring)

1315
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,820
 And all across this room, let us cast our cares on him.

1316
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:09,140
 And then pray by his grace that we would believe

1317
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,900
 that he cares and he is big enough to carry us.

1318
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,180
 So much bigger than we thought he was.

1319
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:27,180
