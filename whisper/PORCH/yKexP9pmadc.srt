1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 James is made up of 108 verses. 54 of them are imperatives. An imperative is a command.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 That Jesus was not just his half-brother, he was his Lord.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Applause]

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Yeah. If we haven't met, I'm the guy that used to be here, I used to carry out David's podium.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I want to start by just telling you how the porch has changed since I've left.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 It's gotten better in just about every way, man. I'm so humbled. I'm so humbled to be with you.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Let me start with a confession before I even dive in to the Scripture.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I love when you guys yell. I love when you yell for me.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Truly, there's something in my heart that is not good that loves that.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 The last thing that I want to do tonight is distract you from Jesus.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 That's both completely wholeheartedly true, and then there's a part of it that's not true.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Because there's the part that wants you to love me. That's not just preacher-speak, that's not just talk.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Honestly, I was worshipping here as they were leading, and there's a weirdness to be back.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I'm just like, "Oh God, I love this so much, and I'm not sure that's good.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I want it to be good, but I love it for you, and I love the way you're moving."

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 So pray for me, pray for my heart, and pray mostly that I would not distract you from Jesus.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I hate waiting. So that's my second confession. I hate waiting on anything.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Anybody else hate waiting? What do you hate waiting for?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Food, traffic, traffic. I miss relationships in Dallas. I do not miss the traffic in Dallas.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But then if you're driving down 35th and Waco, you'll be waiting there too at times.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 What else do you hate waiting on? For him to propose. Is he here?

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Is he here because we could try to pressure him into that right now.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So I don't know where you're watching from. I know there's like 18 campuses around the world.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Maybe you're in a living room, maybe you're gathered in some other city.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But I'm sure you hate waiting too. There's all kinds of things that I hate waiting for.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I hate going on YouTube to watch something, and then they give me this ad,

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 and I have to wait three seconds to skip the ad. But sometimes they won't let me skip the ad.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Like I got to watch the whole commercial, like it's 2010, you know.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 It's like I don't understand there's these different things.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I hate waiting for the line in the grocery store.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So I play this game where I'll go all the way down to see the aisles,

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 to see who has the fewest stuff so that I don't wait.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And if I'm getting in the express lane, what I do is I start counting how many things they have in front of me.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Because if it's over, I judge them. And I'm angry that they made me late.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Like I do not like waiting. I hate for the traffic. You guys said that.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 But then there's also the stoplights. And it's like I'm trying to get somewhere,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 and I hit the stoplight. So I play this game there too,

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 where I look at the cars in the lanes, and I try to discern which one's faster.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And I'll get in behind. Anybody else do this?

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Okay. Yeah. And I try to get in.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And you know, if one lane has three cars and one lane has two, like I'm certainly going to get behind.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 So I mean, I try to pull in front of them. I do this maneuver.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I've been practicing my whole life since I was 16 for it.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 But I just don't like waiting. So you can imagine when COVID hit.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And I know we're sick of talking about COVID. I get it. We're tired of talking about it.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But when it hit, it was really hard on me.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Okay. Especially when we had to quarantine. I'm an Enneagram 7 extrovert.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I want to go. I see you, dude. I see you. I know.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And so I'm sitting there one day, and I'm just hating life.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I'm like, God, is this a commercial for hell? You know?

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And this deal comes across my laptop. And it's a travel deal to Mexico.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And so I'm like, is this a gift? You know?

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And so I book it without talking to my wife, without even looking at the calendar.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Because here's why. Because it was a 24-hour. You could cancel in 24 hours.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 So I'm like, I'll book it. I'll go home. I'll pretend like it's a gift for her.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And then if she doesn't like the gift, I'll say, don't worry, I can return it. Right?

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And she didn't like the gift. And so I went back to cancel it.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But it said that I had to call to cancel.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So I called Orbitz, or a company who should remain nameless.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And they put me on hold.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And so I waited. I waited for an hour.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And then I had to hang up.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So then I called them back that night at 6 p.m.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And they put me on hold.

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And then I eventually talked to somebody.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And she said, hey, you can't cancel because you're outside your 24-hour window.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 I said, I'm an hour outside of my 24-hour window because you put me on hold for three hours.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And I said, I need to talk to a manager.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 They said, well, the manager won't be in for a couple hours.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I said, that's okay. I'll wait. I'm used to it.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Guess how long I was on hold for?

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Three hours? Four hours?

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 That's a lot. Right? That's a long time. Four hours.

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Ain't nobody got time for that.

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Nine hours! I was on hold for nine hours.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Now I know you think, oh, pastors don't do anything. You've got all this time.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 No, no. From 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. I sat on -- I'm not going to give up.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 You're past the point of no return, right, at that point.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I'm like, no, I'm going to stay on hold until we figure this thing out.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And it paid off because eventually I escalated to the owner of Orbitz.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And they gave me -- true story, true story -- they gave me $900 cash for waiting on hold.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I was like, I'll take it. I know, it's a crazy story, right?

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 But I don't like waiting. And I know that you're here tonight,

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 and some of you feel like that's trivial because you're waiting for something way bigger than that.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Maybe for him to propose.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 You're waiting for marriage. Okay?

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Maybe you're waiting to have sex.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Maybe you've gone to God with something and you feel like he put you on hold.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And you're just waiting. You're like, Lord, when are you going to answer this prayer?

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Right? And God, don't you see what's happening in the world?

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It's getting out of control. So like, Jesus, if you want to come back, come on back.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I'm so tired of waiting. Maybe you're waiting for your parents to reconcile.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Maybe you're waiting for someone to come and say, hey, I'm really sorry for what I did to you.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Let me just ask you. And you don't have to answer out loud this time.

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But I do want you to answer. What are you waiting for?

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 What's the biggest angst of waiting that you have right now?

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 I want everybody to answer. Think of it in your head. What is it?

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 What do you feel like God's slow on?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Let me give you just a second to think about that.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 The greatest angst in your heart, the biggest thing that you're waiting for, whether you realize it or not,

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 is for Jesus to come back. And I know that feels like a Jesus juke.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Like, I get it. You're like, no, that really wasn't my answer.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 It really was for him to propose. But in that moment, everything is resolved and there's nothing else you're waiting for.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 There is no conversation with God. Why didn't you let me get married?

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Why didn't you let me have sex? Why didn't you bring him back to say I'm sorry?

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Why did you do that to me? No, no, no. In that moment, when you're face to face with the creator of the heavens and the earth,

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 everything in resolve, there is no angst left in your heart.

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And so that is the thing that you're waiting for.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 So in this series, we're moving through the book of James. We're in chapter five.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 If you want to turn there with me, we call this the full truth from the half brother, which is a brilliant name.

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Last week, Josh did a great job taking us through verses one through six in chapter five.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 We got to hear rodeo stories from the past. You will hear no rodeo stories tonight.

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I have none. As we look at this text, this section,

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I want to talk about how we wait for resolution as Christians.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We want God to fix all this, all the broken things that we say, all the broken things that we see in the world.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And the answer to the question, the points that I'm going to put before you is we wait with patience.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 We wait with hope and we wait with integrity. That's what the Holy Spirit is going to say through James.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 James is Jesus's half brother. This is the first epistle that shows up in the New Testament,

119
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 meaning it was written earliest about 45 A.D. It's known as the New Testament book of Proverbs or book of wisdom.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 It's also known as a commentary on the Sermon on the Mount. James, his half brother, Jesus, gave a sermon.

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And he wrote this commentary to that. And so this is where we've been.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And I'll just start in verse seven. Be patient. Underline that if you have a pen. Patient.

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Be patient then, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop.

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Patiently waiting for the autumn and spring rains. You too, be patient. Underline that word patient.

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And stand firm because the Lord's coming is near. Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 The judge is standing at the door. And it has everyone's favorite illustration baked in.

127
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You know, the one about farming, because we're all farmers and we do horse stuff and that kind of thing.

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And so, yeah, shout out. And so, I know we don't know much about farming,

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 but in this day, when this was written in an agrarian culture, you would plant the seed.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 You would plow the field. You would plant the seed. You would wait. You would pray for rain.

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 You would wait for the crop to grow so that you could harvest the crop.

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 There was a lot of doing and a lot of waiting. And there was a part that you were responsible for.

133
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And then there was a part that was absolutely and completely out of your control,

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 which is a great metaphor for us to walk in faithfulness. We take care of faithfulness.

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 The bullseye, the goal for our lives is to be faithful and let God be God because we're not God.

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Right. We can't do what is out of our control. And the word that is repeated there is what?

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It's patience. And so, number one, we wait with patience.

138
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 We wait with patience.

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 There's two word for patience in the Greek. Hupomone and Makrithomeo.

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Hupomone and Makrithomeo. Makrithomeo is the word that is here.

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 It's not just patience like we think of patience. It's waiting with a long temper.

142
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And you think, what does that mean with a long temper? Well, what does it mean if someone has a short temper?

143
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Everybody knows somebody with a short temper. Don't set me up, man. You better not go there.

144
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Now, you don't know who you're messing with. That's the short temper guy. Don't date him.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Okay. It literally translates a long fuse.

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So we know what it is to have a short fuse, but to have a long fuse, like you can't set me off.

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 I can be patient under suffering. That's the word here.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 We wait patiently for the Lord to return under suffering, long suffering.

149
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 We're able to endure hardship.

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And waiting with patience, Makrithomeo, means not to turn on each other.

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 That's a word for 2020. Be patient and stand firm.

152
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Because, why do I be patient and stand firm? Because, here's the reason why.

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Let me tell you why. The Lord's coming is near.

154
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Now, here's the reality. That was written 2,000 years ago.

155
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 But when you compare 2,000 years to eternity, it is but a second.

156
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So if Jesus comes back tomorrow, or if he comes back 10,000 years, relatively speaking, it is still very close.

157
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And so don't turn on each other. Let me give you a hot take.

158
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 It's going to get weird for just a minute.

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 What I think happened in the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, this is just my opinion.

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So take it for what it's worth. Just my opinion.

161
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I can't chapter and verse this, which is dangerous.

162
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 I think Satan, the devil, pulled all the spiritual evil forces together, all the demons.

163
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And he said, "You guys ready? We just want to unleash the spirit of division on the land.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 You ready? That's what we're going to do. That's our one strategy. Just divide them.

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Turn black against white, Republican against Democrat.

166
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Divide the churches. Turn husband against wife, father against son.

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Just divide them. Just divide them. Just divide them."

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And as people have said, "Well, we are more divided as a country than we've been in a very, very long time."

169
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 It's working.

170
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And it's like we've given up waiting.

171
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 He says, "Don't grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.

172
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 The judge is standing at the door. The judge is standing at the door.

173
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 So don't grumble against each other."

174
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Now, any teachers in the room? Anybody teach a classroom today?

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I love it, man. Okay, there's a lot of you.

176
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 So we're in a classroom today.

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Hey, let me ask you guys, the teachers, a question.

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 How long can you leave the classroom?

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Never? What grade?

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Fourth graders? Yeah, you can't leave long.

181
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 High school, you still can't leave long, right?

182
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And for the rest of us who aren't teachers, we remember.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Like the teacher leaves the class, and you remember, "Hey, you guys be good.

184
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I've got to run to the principal's office real quick.

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Stay in your seat. Be good."

186
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Leaves the classroom, and at first it's quiet.

187
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You know, at first it's quiet.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And then people start talking a little bit.

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 And then they start talking a lot a bit.

190
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And then it gets loud, and all of a sudden you're up out of your seat.

191
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And maybe push comes to shove over here.

192
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 There's some conflict. "What did you say about me?

193
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Hey, you call my girl? What'd you do?"

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And then you're like this, right?

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And you've got the fist cocked back.

196
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And then the teacher walks in.

197
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And I don't care what happened before that.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It doesn't look good for you.

199
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Okay? You're in trouble at that point.

200
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And this is what he's saying.

201
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 "I'm standing at the door, guys.

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 I see you.

203
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 I see what you said about her.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I see what you thought about him.

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 What are you doing, man?

206
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 What happened to be diligent to preserving the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace?

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Why are you so divisive?

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 What are you doing? Guys, I'm at the door. I see you."

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 What do you want to be doing when Jesus comes back?

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Where do you want to be?

211
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 What do you want to be listening to?

212
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 What do you want to be watching?

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Who do you want to be with?

214
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And maybe you're like, "Honestly, JP, I wish he'd hurry up.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Like, let's get this show on the road.

216
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 What's he waiting on? He said he's at the door that he's going to return soon.

217
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 What are we waiting on?"

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 He promised. He promised.

219
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Why doesn't he keep his promise?

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 I have a verse for you. 2 Peter 3, 9.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 It says, "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promises, as some understand slowness.

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 But he's patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 So it's actually God being patient with you.

224
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Like, he's waiting for you to go on mission, for you to go everywhere and tell everyone about Jesus,

225
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 for you to begin to share your faith, for you to begin to live with a purpose.

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And I know you're like, "Wait, no. But he needs to deal with evil, man.

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You don't know what happened to me. You don't know what they did to me."

228
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You want God to deal with evil? Who wants God to deal with evil?

229
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 You want God to deal with evil? Where does he start?

230
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Does he start with the rapist or the person who looked at pornography?

231
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Oh, you want him to start with the murderer or the one who gossiped?

232
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Where do you want him to start?

233
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Because this is the way we work.

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 We draw a line in the sand and we say, "God, deal with all that evil."

235
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But if God dealt with evil right now, he'd deal with you.

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 That's the whole point of us. We need a Savior.

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 We're desperate for a Savior.

238
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 If God dealt with evil right now, if he abolished evil, I wouldn't be here.

239
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 He'd deal with me.

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And he'd deal with you.

241
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But it's hard. I do know. I realize. I understand the world is broken.

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 That's why he says in verse 10, "Brothers and sisters, as an example of patience in the face of suffering,

243
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord."

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 He said, "You want an example of people who waited under suffering?

245
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Look at the prophets in the Word."

246
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 You remember, we could talk about the prophets.

247
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 We'll go with Noah. Remember Noah?

248
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 He's the one who built the big boat called an ark.

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 I don't know if you realize this, but it had never rained.

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And God says, "Hey, I want you to build an ark."

251
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So he spends his life, like his lot in life is to build a giant boat.

252
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So he starts building it and everybody's making fun of him.

253
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 "What are you doing, Noah? Building a boat in the middle of the land? You crazy man."

254
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And it is his lot in life to be canceled.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Everybody is just basically making fun of him.

256
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 He's like, "No, guys, you don't understand. It's going to rain."

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 They're like, "What's rain?"

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And so he finishes the boat. They put all the animals on it.

259
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And he closes the door. And do you know what happened?

260
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 You know what happened?

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Anybody know what happened?

262
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 No. Nothing happened.

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 For days, they closed the door and nothing happened.

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Now you imagine a conversation with your wife.

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 "Hey, Noah, you sure you didn't say, 'Go buy some art?'"

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 "You sure you said, 'Build an ark, bud,' because nothing's..."

267
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Yeah, he was ridiculed.

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 But he operated in faithfulness.

269
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered.

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen

271
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 what the Lord finally brought about.

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 This word "perseverance," here we see the word "hupamone."

274
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's often translated "patience" as well.

275
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 But he says, "Look at the example of the prophets."

276
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 "They wait with hope." They know what's coming.

277
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 They know Jesus is coming back. And that's my second point.

278
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Wait with hope. We wait with hope.

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 As the classroom goes in disarray,

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 as everyone starts to bicker and they're up out of their seats,

281
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 the good students, they sit there patiently at their desk,

282
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 hoping that the teacher is quick to return.

283
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I hope they come quick and bring order. That's our role.

284
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 God, please, pray, Lord, please come back quickly

285
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 and make sense of all of this mess.

286
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Because it's messy, because there's cancer, and there's heartbreak,

287
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and there's death of loved ones.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And at some point, you're going to have a crisis of faith

289
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 where you're going to be like, "Why does God let this happen?"

290
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 "If he's a good God, why is the world so broken?"

291
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Do you ever feel that way? Why is the world so broken?

292
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Let me give you a good, sound theological answer to that.

293
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Genesis chapter 3.

294
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 The fall. Sin entered the world.

295
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 The world is not as it should be. Your theology has to be good.

296
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Jesus said what he promised you is in this world you will have trouble.

297
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 So when you have trouble, you should be like,

298
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 "Jesus, thank you for keeping your promises. Thank you for giving me a heads up."

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Who's going to have trouble? Christians, followers of Jesus,

300
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 God's children will have trouble.

301
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 The Christian life is not the easy life.

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 It's not like once you prayed to receive Jesus, now it's like easy street.

303
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 So even God's people suffer.

304
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 In comparison, honestly guys, what I would tell you is all we do is suffer.

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Comparatively speaking to being in the presence of God,

306
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I mean really your happiest moment here is going to feel like suffering in the kingdom.

307
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 That's good news.

308
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 If you have Jesus, if you've trusted in him for his death and resurrection,

309
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 for the forgiveness of your sins, a payment for your sins,

310
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 this is as bad as it will ever be.

311
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 But if you're here tonight and you haven't yet placed your faith in Jesus,

312
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 believing that he suffered for your sins so that you don't have to suffer for your sins,

313
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 if you haven't done that yet, this is as good as it will ever be.

314
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 This is your heaven.

315
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow you die.

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 That's a sobering reality.

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 And so we suffer, we endure hardships knowing that Jesus is going to come back and make it okay.

318
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 This is what it says, verse 11.

319
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 As you know, we count as blessed those who have persevered.

320
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And then he gives us a specific example.

321
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about.

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 You guys know the story of Job?

323
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Kind of a beatdown of a book.

324
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Let me just go ahead and give you that heads up.

325
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 What happens, Satan is like, "Hey, God, nobody loves you."

326
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And God's like, "Job loves me."

327
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 And Satan's like, "Well, he wouldn't love you if I messed with him."

328
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And God's like, "Wait for it. Go ahead."

329
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 That's confusing.

330
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And so Satan does begin to mess with him.

331
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And you see this unfold.

332
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And this is a story in the scripture. It actually happened.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And so Job, he's in misery for months.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 He has these open sores all over him.

335
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And he begins to pick his scabs with shards of pottery.

336
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And seven of his sons die.

337
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And three of his daughters die.

338
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 And all of his wealth vanished in one afternoon.

339
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 He put it all on Dogecoin and it just vanished.

340
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Like it was just gone, right?

341
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And so he becomes repulsive to his wife.

342
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 He's hated by his friends.

343
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And even little children despised him as he lay on the ash heap outside of town.

344
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And this is what he says.

345
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 "I know that my Redeemer lives."

346
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 "And that in the end, He will stand on the earth."

347
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God."

348
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 "I myself will see Him with my own eyes, I and not another, how my heart yearns within me."

349
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And God restores him. It says at the back of the book.

350
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 God restores him. He gets everything back two times.

351
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And I'm still like, "That's a bad deal."

352
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Because he doesn't get his sons back. He doesn't get his daughters back.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 His marriage is wrecked.

354
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And so like...

355
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 And this is why, you've got to hear me on this.

356
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 This is why eternity is the great equalizer.

357
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 This is why James says, "Life is but a vapor."

358
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 It's that long.

359
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 You're here for but a moment.

360
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 You guys don't even know your great-great-grandfather's name.

361
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Right? And he was alive 50 years ago.

362
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Your life is so short.

363
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Nobody's going to remember you. The deaths you return.

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It all comes down to, "What did you do with Jesus?"

365
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 A hundred years from now, the only thing that matters...

366
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 It won't matter your shoes if you've got the latest Air Force 1s or the Yeezys or Golden Goose.

367
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 What's going to matter a hundred years from now is, "What did you do with Jesus?"

368
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 "What did you do with Him?"

369
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 "What did you say about Him?"

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Because I've got to tell you something that I don't think is taught very often.

371
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 You're in the Job experiment.

372
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Don't you guys understand that?

373
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 We're in the same experiment Job's in.

374
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Let me explain it.

375
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 See, Lucifer was the greatest of angels.

376
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 He's in heaven with God.

377
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And he's an angel.

378
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And he says to God, "God, I don't want to worship you. I want to be worshipped."

379
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 "I want to be like you."

380
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Pride was the sin that made the devil the devil.

381
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 And so God says, "Oh, you want to be God? Let's see what kind of God you are."

382
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And he sends him to earth.

383
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And God creates people.

384
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And God's like, "Let's see who they worship."

385
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 "Will they worship the God of this world, or the prince of this air, or will they worship me?"

386
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 This is what the Scripture says about Satan in 2 Corinthians 4, verse 4.

387
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 "The God of this world..." Who is that?

388
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 "The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers."

389
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 That's Satan.

390
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 In Ephesians 2, verse 2, it says,

391
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 "In which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and the ruler of the kingdom of the air."

392
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Who is that?

393
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 That's Satan.

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 See, Satan has authority here.

395
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And he's trying to lure you astray.

396
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He's attacking you.

397
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 He has one motive.

398
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 He has one strategy.

399
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 To not let you worship or follow God.

400
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 To not allow you to trust in Jesus.

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 He wants to steal, kill, and destroy.

402
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You're in the same experiment.

403
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Who am I going to worship? God, or the God of this world?

404
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 You're just in the same experiment as Job.

405
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Don't you understand?

406
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 So who's winning?

407
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 And this is why you've got to make this deal right now.

408
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 What has to happen for you to follow God?

409
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Let me say it in a different way.

410
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 What has to happen for you not to follow God?

411
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Let me say it like this.

412
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 What has to happen for you to turn away from God?

413
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Say, "God, if you don't do that, then I'm out."

414
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Or, "If you do that, then I'm out."

415
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "You don't let me get married, I'm not going to follow you."

416
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 "You don't let me have children, nah."

417
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 "You don't give me the promotion, nope."

418
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Nope. Nope.

419
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 "I'm going to follow you. I'm going to go to the porch every Tuesday."

420
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 "Church every Sunday. Community group. I'm going to be a member."

421
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 "But if you do this, I'm out."

422
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 What is it?

423
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 What is it?

424
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Because you'd be better off saying what it is right now.

425
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 And just being really honest.

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 "God, this is what it is. I'll tell you what I love more than you do."

427
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 "I'll tell you what I love more than you."

428
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 When I do a wedding.

429
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 When I do a wedding.

430
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Lots of premarital counseling.

431
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 When he asks, call me.

432
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 [laughter]

433
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I say this. Listen, this is important.

434
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I say, "Hey, what would you guys divorce over?"

435
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 To which, you know, they're like, "Nothing. We love each other, man."

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I'm like, "Okay. Like truly nothing?"

437
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 I look to her, I'm like, "Hey, what would you leave him for?"

438
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Right? Because we're going to say these vows.

439
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 You're going to say, you know, "For richer or poorer, in sickness and health, till death do us part."

440
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Do you mean that? Like, what would you leave him for?

441
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 She's like, "I wouldn't leave him for anything. I love him."

442
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 "I love him with all my heart."

443
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 [laughter]

444
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 "He's my lobster. Like, you don't understand."

445
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 [laughter]

446
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And I say, "Cool. Let me ask you."

447
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 "So he cheats on you with your sister and makes a TikTok out of it. We still good?"

448
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 [laughter]

449
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 "We still good?"

450
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And she's like, "Well, maybe that."

451
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 [laughter]

452
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 And I'm like, "Cool, cool."

453
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Because we're going to throw that in the vows.

454
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 You know, "For richer or poorer, in sickness and health, till death do us part, unless he cheats on me with my sister and makes a TikTok."

455
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And I'm just going to say that in front of all your friends.

456
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Because let's just be honest, man.

457
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Let's just keep it real, okay?

458
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Like 100. Let's just be completely.

459
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 So God, here's the deal.

460
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I'm going to follow you with all of my life, unless...

461
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And what are you putting there?

462
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And you've got to answer that.

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 What's the "unless"?

464
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Because, here's why.

465
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 That's where Satan is going to attack you.

466
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 That's what he's going...

467
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 That's where he's coming after you.

468
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And I know that that should be.

469
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 It should be a little unsettling.

470
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Except for, greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.

471
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 That's the good news.

472
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 That's the good news.

473
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And so you can say, like Job did,

474
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 "I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end,

475
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 He will stand on the earth, and after my skin has been destroyed,

476
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 yet in my flesh I will see God.

477
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 I myself will see Him with my own eyes.

478
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I am not another.

479
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 How my heart yearns within me.

480
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 My Redeemer lives."

481
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He lives.

482
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 James says, verse 12,

483
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 "Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear,

484
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 not by heaven or by earth, or by anything else.

485
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 All you need to say is a simple yes or no,

486
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 otherwise you will be condemned."

487
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Boom.

488
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I was like, what does that mean?

489
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 How did he go there?

490
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Because he's like, "Jesus is coming back.

491
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 He's standing at the door.

492
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Be on your best behavior.

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Make sure that you know Him.

494
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Oh, and by the way, don't pinky promise.

495
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 You know, just say yes, no."

496
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 I was like, that's a weird...

497
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Why is he saying that?

498
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Why did he go there?

499
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Because he's saying, "Hey, God keeps His promises,

500
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 so you keep your promises.

501
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 God keeps His word,

502
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 so you better keep your word."

503
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Number three, he says, "Wait with integrity."

504
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Wait with integrity.

505
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Remember, Jesus' half-brother is writing a commentary

506
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 on the Sermon on the Mount.

507
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And so in Matthew 5, verse 37, Jesus says,

508
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "Let your yes be yes and your no be no."

509
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 He says, "Keep your word."

510
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 The reason that your yes can be trusted

511
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 is because you do what you say you're going to do.

512
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And I don't know if you realize how important integrity is

513
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 in the Christian life,

514
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 but the gospel is the way that the Holy Spirit saves people.

515
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And the gospel is actually a story,

516
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 that you're a sinner separated from God by your sin,

517
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 and God loved you so much

518
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 that He doesn't want to punish you for your sin.

519
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 He sent His own Son, Jesus Christ,

520
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 to be punished in your place for the abortion,

521
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 for the sex, for prom night,

522
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 for what you did yesterday or on the way here,

523
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 what you said about her or what you thought about Him.

524
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 The thing you stole, the person you killed,

525
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Jesus died for that.

526
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 That's the gospel.

527
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 That's the good news.

528
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And it's a story.

529
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 I'm sharing with you the story.

530
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And I'm sharing with you the story of the Holy Spirit

531
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 who is the one who's going to save you

532
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 from the grave.

533
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And if you trust in that,

534
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 then you don't have to pay for your sins in hell.

535
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Because the only thing that you can do in hell

536
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 is pay for your sins forever.

537
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 So the only person who doesn't go to hell

538
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 is the person whose sins have been paid for.

539
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 It's not like good people go to heaven

540
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 and bad people go to hell.

541
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 No, no, no, no.

542
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Good and bad people in hell,

543
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 good and bad people in heaven,

544
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 they're going to be like, "Dude,

545
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 "I mean, you flaked out on me last Friday.

546
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 "You're telling me this dude came back to life?

547
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 "For real?

548
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 "Guess what, man, I got to tell you something.

549
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 "I don't trust you.

550
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 "And I don't trust your gospel."

551
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Before anybody trusts in Christ,

552
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 they trust a Christian.

553
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 That's why he says this here.

554
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Before anybody is going to place their faith in Jesus Christ,

555
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 they're going to be communicated that message

556
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 by a Christian.

557
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Some of you are here, right?

558
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And you're like, "No, I've been hurt by the church."

559
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Man, you don't understand.

560
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 I've been hurt by the church.

561
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Anybody know anybody who's been hurt by the church?

562
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Anybody know somebody who's been hurt by the church?

563
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Yeah, guess what?

564
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 No, you don't.

565
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 You don't know anybody that's been hurt by the church.

566
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It's not like their whole church,

567
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 like, you know, First Baptist, Ulist,

568
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 "Hey, gather everyone up.

569
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 "Come on, everybody line up,

570
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 "and let's just make fun of them, call them names."

571
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 You're of a church.

572
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 So you weren't hurt by the church.

573
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 You were hurt by the church's representative,

574
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 a member of the church, right?

575
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 That's very important

576
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 because people are going to disappoint you.

577
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 But when you're that person,

578
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 when you disappoint someone,

579
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 you go back to them and you say,

580
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 "Hey, I'm so sorry.

581
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 "I did not let my yes be yes.

582
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 "Will you please forgive me?"

583
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Because you steward

584
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 the most important message

585
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 that has ever been told

586
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 in the history of the world.

587
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 For God so loved the world

588
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 that he gave his only begotten Son

589
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 that whoever believes in him,

590
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 whoever believes in him,

591
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 whoever believes in him

592
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 shall not perish,

593
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 but have eternal life.

594
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And the way they're going to believe in him

595
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 is if they believe you when you talk about him.

596
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 So let your yes be yes,

597
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 and your no be no,

598
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 and do what you say you're going to do

599
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 as you steward the gospel.

600
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Jesus kept his commitment

601
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 to die for our sins.

602
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And he kept his commitment

603
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 to come back to life.

604
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And he will keep his commitment

605
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 to return again.

606
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 One day, I don't know when,

607
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I hope it's before you get to your car,

608
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 the sky's going to crack open like a scroll

609
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 and you're going to see

610
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 the Son of Man coming on a white horse

611
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and you're going to see

612
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 the Son of Man coming on a white horse

613
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 and a robe dipped in blood

614
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 with a sick tat

615
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 that says

616
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 "The King of Kings, Lord of Lords."

617
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Man, it's going to be awesome.

618
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And so live like he's coming back, friends.

619
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Live like he's coming back.

620
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Have you ever seen the movie "Cast Away"?

621
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I'm just curious now,

622
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 by show of hands,

623
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 how many people have you seen it?

624
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 So a lot of you,

625
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 because I'm going to totally ruin it,

626
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 because it's 20 years old.

627
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 So it came out when you were born.

628
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 You've had 20 years to see it,

629
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 so if I ruin it, it's not my fault.

630
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 That's your fault.

631
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 And so it's Tom Hanks,

632
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Woody from "Toy Story."

633
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 So Woody from "Toy Story,"

634
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 he's trapped on a deserted island.

635
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Man, true story, there's nobody else there,

636
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 like shipwreck, he's on this deserted island

637
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 all by himself.

638
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 He's so lonely, he becomes best friends

639
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 with a volleyball, "Wilson!"

640
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 For years and years and years.

641
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 And he's got a family, right?

642
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 He's separated from his family, all by himself,

643
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 on a deserted island, nobody comes to save him.

644
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 But here's the part where I ruin it.

645
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Somebody actually does come to save him eventually,

646
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 and they get him, and they're taking him home to his family.

647
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And it's this big, climactic, epic moment

648
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 where he's about to meet his wife,

649
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 and it's everything that you thought it would be.

650
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 It's raining, and they lock eyes from across the parking lot,

651
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 and they get, and they run, and they embrace,

652
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 and it's this amazing embrace,

653
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 and then they start making out, right?

654
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And it's raining, and it's incredible,

655
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 and then she stops kissing him, and she looks him in the eyes,

656
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 and she says, "I knew you would come back.

657
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 "I knew you would come back."

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 But then it gets weird.

659
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Because she's married.

660
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 "I know.

661
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 "I know.

662
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 "She moved on."

663
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Which tells me what?

664
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 She didn't know.

665
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And so if you're here,

666
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 and you're like, "I know Jesus is coming back.

667
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 "I know he's coming back."

668
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 But you date however you want.

669
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 You say whatever you want.

670
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 You do whatever you want.

671
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 You spin however you want.

672
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 You compare however you want.

673
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 You do not believe he's coming back.

674
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Your words say one thing.

675
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Your life says something else.

676
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You gotta know that, man.

677
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 He's coming back

678
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 before you know it.

679
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 So in summary,

680
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 wait with patience.

681
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 End your suffering.

682
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Wait with hope.

683
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Believing that he's coming back.

684
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And wait with integrity.

685
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 So that you can be trusted.

686
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 It's really like,

687
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 if I had to summarize all of those,

688
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 it's like,

689
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 wait with the confidence

690
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 that Jesus is coming back.

691
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 You feel that?

692
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Wait with hope.

693
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 You feel that?

694
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 I became a Christian

695
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 at this church.

696
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And as a young adult.

697
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 That's why I'm so passionate about

698
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 the season of life that you're in.

699
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 But I wasn't always a Christian

700
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 as a young adult, and so

701
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 I was amazing at being an unbeliever.

702
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 So I partied really hard,

703
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 and one night,

704
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 my boys and I, we were at the Village Country Club.

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 And so, you know the village apartments,

706
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 there's a bar there, that's where we were at.

707
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 And, um, is it still there?

708
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Okay, good.

709
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 (laughter)

710
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 Or not good, I don't know.

711
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 And so we're there,

712
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 and we really had two objectives

713
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 when we went out.

714
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It was either to take a girl home,

715
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 or to get in a fight.

716
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Those were the two things we were focused on doing

717
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 when we went out, okay?

718
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 Stop judging me, man, I didn't know Jesus.

719
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And so we were out,

720
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 and as usual,

721
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 no girls took interest.

722
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And so,

723
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 my buddy's walking around

724
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 the club, and he's the littlest one of us,

725
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 okay, I gotta tell you,

726
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 he's pretty small.

727
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 But he's intoxicated, he's had too much to drink,

728
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 and he's doing that weird thing that guys do

729
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 where he's walking around like this, you know?

730
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And he's just, he's walking around the club like this,

731
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 just looking for something.

732
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 And so he finds the one guy in the bar, smaller than him,

733
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 and he does this dumb thing that guys do.

734
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 He's like, "What are you looking at?"

735
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 You know?

736
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 It's brilliant, right?

737
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And so next thing you know, they're chest to chest,

738
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 about to make out,

739
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 breathing heavy into each other's face, right?

740
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And I see it, so I go over there,

741
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 and I separate them.

742
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no, not tonight, man.

743
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 "I'm gonna take you home, bro, you've had too much to drink,

744
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 "I'm gonna get you home."

745
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 And so I separate them, and this guy goes,

746
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 "Hey, don't you touch me."

747
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 (audience laughs)

748
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 And I'm like,

749
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 "Hey, no, it's cool, man, he's had too much,

750
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 "I'm sorry for whatever he said,

751
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 "I'm gonna take him home, we're gonna go home,

752
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 "keep doing your thing, man,

753
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 "you look like you're having a good time, keep going at it."

754
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And I turn my back for one second,

755
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 and they're back at it again, about to make out,

756
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 and so I go, and I go,

757
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 and I separate them again,

758
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 I push them back,

759
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 and this guy goes,

760
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "I told you, don't you touch me."

761
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 And I'm like,

762
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 "Bro."

763
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 (audience laughs)

764
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 "Why are you doing that, man?

765
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 "I'm trying to take my friend home,

766
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 "and you're over here slapping my hand away,

767
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 "and like, don't,

768
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 "like, don't, don't be that way."

769
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 (audience laughs)

770
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 And hey, he did the craziest thing

771
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 I've ever seen anybody do in this situation, right?

772
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 He looks at me straight in the eyes,

773
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 and he pulls out his cell phone,

774
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 and he does this,

775
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 and he's just looking at me like this.

776
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 (audience laughs)

777
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 "Hey, you here?

778
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 "All right, I got something I need you to take care of."

779
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 (audience laughs)

780
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 And he hangs up, I know, I know,

781
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 I was like, "Who'd you, was that your dad?

782
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 "Who'd you call?

783
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 "Was that Batman? Like, what did you do?"

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 And like, if I'm totally honest with you,

785
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 like, his confidence was unsettling to me.

786
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 I'm like, he knows something I don't know,

787
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 so I'm scared at this point, truly, I'm like,

788
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 "Hey, guys, we gotta go!

789
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 "He called somebody, I don't know who, we gotta go!"

790
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 And we're all surrounded up, like, they believe me,

791
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 they see I'm kinda panicked, and so we're like,

792
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 "All right, we're going." And I saw who he called!

793
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 I saw who he called!

794
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 These two cartoon characters get out of a truck, right?

795
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Like, they had school buses for breakfast,

796
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 you know, like,

797
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 they eat steroids, I don't know,

798
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 and they're yoked up,

799
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 they're taller than me,

800
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 you know, got muscle shirts on, you know?

801
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 And one dude has a chain,

802
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 not like this kind of chain,

803
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 like a chain you pull a car with,

804
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 like this right here, a padlock, I'm not even kidding, right?

805
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 And they go, and he gets out of the car,

806
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 he's like, "Are these the guys?"

807
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 I was like, "No, they left, they went that way."

808
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 (laughter)

809
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 And I'm like, "Why?"

810
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 It's like all of the sudden

811
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 I knew why that guy was so resolved.

812
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 He had so much peace about him.

813
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 It's like he was saying,

814
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 "Whatever you're gonna do to me,

815
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 "you're not gonna do it long."

816
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 You hear that?

817
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 It's like what he was saying,

818
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 he was like, "Hey, you don't understand,

819
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 "like I got somebody coming.

820
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 "Whatever you're about to do to me,

821
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 "you're not gonna do it long.

822
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 "Can you

823
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 "look Satan

824
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 "in the eyes right now

825
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 "and say that?

826
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 "Whatever you're gonna do to me,

827
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 "you're not gonna do it long.

828
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 "My Redeemer lives.

829
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 "I'm gonna see him again.

830
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 "Don't you know, bro?"

831
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Listen, he keeps his promises.

832
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 He keeps his promises.

833
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 You know how I know he keeps his promises,

834
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 by the way, Mr. Lucifer?

835
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Okay, he died

836
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 on a cross for me.

837
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 He died on a cross.

838
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 And I know you were happy about that.

839
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 You thought you won for a minute,

840
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 but then boom, he came back to life

841
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 and you lose.

842
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And I placed my faith in him.

843
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 So whatever you're gonna

844
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 do to me for my little 76 years,

845
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 you wanna keep me single?

846
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 That's fine.

847
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 You wanna keep me celibate? That's fine.

848
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 You wanna keep me poor?

849
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 That's okay.

850
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 You wanna keep me forgotten?

851
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 I'm not forgotten, dude. Don't you see?

852
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 The creator of the heavens and the earth knows my name.

853
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 See, he wrote in a book.

854
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 He sealed my soul with his Holy Spirit.

855
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 He formed me in my

856
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 mother's womb. He knows how many hairs are on my head.

857
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 But before

858
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 creation,

859
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 he created me for a purpose,

860
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 to live for him. I'm not gonna

861
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 fall for your stupid tricks.

862
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Not today.

863
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Not ever.

864
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 I'm not gonna lose hope.

865
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 I will wait with patience.

866
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 I will wait with hope.

867
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 And I will wait

868
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 with integrity.

869
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Because my redeemer lives.

870
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 And he keeps his promises.

871
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Let me pray that you would.

872
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Father, help us

873
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 believe that. Because I bet

874
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 when I say

875
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 celibacy,

876
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 that's scary.

877
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Singleness.

878
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Poor.

879
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Forgotten. Nobody wants that.

880
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 We don't want that.

881
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 That's not what we want.

882
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 But we follow

883
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Jesus, and what he said

884
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 to you was not my will,

885
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 but thy will.

886
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And so, okay.

887
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 Here's my

888
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 real ask.

889
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Will you protect us

890
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 from

891
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 the enemy?

892
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 Will you protect us from the enemy?

893
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 And will you help us

894
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 to never stop loving

895
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 you? And will

896
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 you help us to never stop looking

897
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 for the return of your savior?

898
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 In Jesus' name,

899
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 amen.
