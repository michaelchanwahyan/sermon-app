[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160]   (gentle music)
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.120]   - Welcome, welcome.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.200]   Friends of the room here in Dallas.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.060]   Tonight we're gonna continue the Colossians series
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.900]   that we're in.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.720]   I'm gonna tell a story,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.560]   they'll kinda tell us where we're going.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.040]   When I started dating my now wife,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.200]   then just date,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.880]   she was driving a very unique automobile.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.080]   And it was this 1994 Toyota Camry
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.360]   that was like a piece of junk, totally.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.320]   It had hundreds of thousands of miles on it.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200]   The windows wouldn't roll down.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.940]   And she lived in College Station, Texas,
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.660]   which is, whoop, very, it's very hot.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.600]   And she didn't have a radio.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.480]   She couldn't open the driver's side door.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240]   So anytime that we would hang out together,
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.200]   she would open the door for me and her
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.440]   and then crawl over to get to her spot.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.740]   So we didn't take her car very often.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.040]   But it was just like this total clunker of a car.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.160]   Every time that she would turn,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.960]   her bumper was hanging from the front of the car
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.860]   on the left side.
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.880]   So when she would take left turns,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.000]   it would like sparks,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.280]   would fireworks show,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.040]   would just go off from this car.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.760]   And really, she grew up in kinda circumstances
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.120]   that that was, the only reason you drive that car
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.960]   is if you have to.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.160]   And this was kinda her case.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.400]   She drove it 'cause she had to.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.280]   She was raised in a single, for the most part, mom family.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.320]   And that was the car that she had.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.640]   And so when I started dating her,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   this was kinda the case.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.120]   So we would take my car most of the time,
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.380]   my little exterior lady car, sorority car,
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.720]   like we talked about a couple weeks ago.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.320]   But there came a day where in the midst of this,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.760]   in the midst of her driving this,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.800]   her mom remarried.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.160]   And he remarried a guy named Charlie.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.280]   And Charlie was about to totally change
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.600]   a lot of things in their life.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.520]   And one day, they went out to dinner as a family.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.320]   And she went out and she was with him.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.960]   And she walked outside after dinner,
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.160]   they left the restaurant.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.520]   She comes outside and she sees this like brand new car
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.960]   with a bow on it.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880]   And she goes, "Oh my gosh, that's so cool.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.880]   "It looks like a commercial.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.440]   "Somebody's getting a car."
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.240]   And Charlie, sugar daddy, just goes,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.880]   I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.800]   Charlie, if you have more of them,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.920]   I don't know why I'm pointing up.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440]   So it's like, Charlie.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.980]   Charlie said, "You're that person.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.960]   "You're getting this car."
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.080]   And she's like so pumped.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.000]   She's ecstatic.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.240]   Of course, all she's ever known is this car,
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.160]   Camry, she called Hank, which for some reason like fit.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.200]   I'm sorry if your name's Hank in the room.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.080]   But she's now stepping into a brand new car.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.480]   She's calling me, she's like excited
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.800]   about the little things like the windows go down
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.320]   and there's air conditioner and there's a radio
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.600]   and all these things that she was so excited about.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   And her relationship with Charlie and him,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.080]   this father presence in her life
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.740]   would change a lot more than the car.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.600]   She was able to go to grad school.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.480]   They were able to finally have a home.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   They kind of had house hopped and rented
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   for years and years and years.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.400]   And this new fatherly relationship totally changed
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   and totally brought with it access
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.200]   to all kinds of things in her life.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.800]   The reason I tell you that is because tonight
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.480]   we are continuing the book of Colossians
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.980]   where Paul in the end of the first chapter,
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.840]   so if you have your Bible, you can flip there,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.480]   is gonna really lay out some of the things
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.720]   that our new relationship as Christians,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.300]   we have been given access or given a new relationship
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.260]   through Jesus and trusting in Jesus' death alone for us,
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.000]   we now enter into a new relationship
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.740]   that brings with it access of all kinds of things.
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.560]   And Paul's gonna lay out really what those things are
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.800]   and how they impact our life.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.160]   And I think what's so important about this message
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160]   is that I think not knowing and not understanding
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.240]   what you and I have in Christ,
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.700]   what Christ has given us is responsible
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.700]   for so much of the defeated mentality, empty mentality,
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.640]   empty experience of life and really despair
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.700]   that many, even if they're Christians,
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.740]   experience in this life.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.460]   And so Paul writes to lay out to these Colossians,
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.180]   no, you don't know how much you have,
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.060]   you don't know who you are
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.380]   and what Christ has given you through him.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.140]   So if you have your Bible, you can open it up to Colossians.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.420]   If you don't know where that is,
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.580]   the best way to get there is there's a table of contents
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.940]   in the front of the Bible, revolutionary.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.980]   And if you flip open to that, you can go there
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.860]   'cause I know what it's like to be like, where, nay whom?
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.600]   I went to seminary and I don't know where that is.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.180]   I'm just flipping, don't judge me.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.640]   And so go to the front and find Colossians.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.760]   We're gonna be in the first chapter.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.900]   If you missed the last two weeks,
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.180]   highly encourage you to go check out those messages.
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.340]   They're all on the porch app
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.620]   or you can find them online at theporchdalas.com.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.980]   We're gonna pick it up in verse 24
[00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.660]   as we continue Paul's letter
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.260]   to this group of new believers in Christ
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.220]   who are mainly Gentile or non-Jewish
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.660]   who are trying to figure out how to live
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.980]   this new Christian life when the New Testament was new
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.500]   and trying to explore what that looks like.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.300]   So Paul writes to give them clarity on this.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.980]   We're gonna really kind of get a running start
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.020]   through the first four verses
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.340]   and then pick up our first point there.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.180]   So here we go, we're gonna be in verse 24, chapter one.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.220]   Paul speaking, "Now I rejoice
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.420]   "in what I am suffering for you.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.860]   "And I fill up in my flesh what is lacking
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.040]   "in regard to Christ's afflictions,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.180]   "for the sake of his body, which is the church."
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.420]   Now Paul basically starts and he says,
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.520]   "Look, I rejoice or I take joy in suffering
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.560]   "to get the message of Jesus, to fulfill,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.880]   "extending and delivering the message of Jesus
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.620]   "to all people who don't have it."
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.300]   That's bizarre, specifically the point where he says,
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.780]   "Look, I rejoice in suffering."
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.860]   And if you don't think it's bizarre,
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.860]   it's because you've been desensitized to it.
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.760]   Who rejoices?
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.580]   What kind of like glutton for punishment are we here, Paul?
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.780]   Where you're like, "Hey, punch me in the arm,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.140]   "punch me in the arm, punch me in the face,
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.420]   "punch me in the face."
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.620]   Where Paul is going, "Look, I rejoice to suffer."
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.860]   But there's something, it's not like Paul is a superhuman,
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.760]   there's something behind why in the midst of suffering
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.440]   to get the message out, which he's sitting
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.940]   in a Roman prison, he can still take joy
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.060]   and he's about to tell us what that is in his life.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.840]   Verse 25, "I have become its servant
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   "by the commission God gave me, servant of the church,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.560]   "to present to you the word of God in its fullness."
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.160]   That word of God, the Old Testament,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.560]   "That I've become the servant of the church
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.820]   "to present to you what God has been doing
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.980]   "since the beginning, what everything's pointed to."
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.820]   Verse 26, "The mystery," he says,
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.220]   "that has been kept hidden for ages and generations,
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.080]   "but is now disclosed to the Lord's people.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.440]   "To them," so he's gonna tell us what this mystery,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.540]   so I'm here to tell what the mystery is.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.680]   "To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.600]   "the glorious riches of this mystery."
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.920]   So lots of buildup, here's the mystery.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.480]   "Christ in you, Gentiles."
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.080]   In other words, for generations past and generations past,
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.060]   the idea that God was a God who really wanted all people
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.720]   to be a part of his chosen people,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.520]   and not just the Jews, was a mystery.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.240]   In other words, Paul says, the mystery is that Christ
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.000]   or God loves everybody.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.340]   Christ will accept anybody.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.140]   The door is wide open, regardless of your color of skin,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.860]   regardless of the things that you've done,
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.180]   regardless of who you are or who you think you are.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.460]   Paul says the mystery is that God is for everybody.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.620]   And again, we read that,
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.620]   and it's not really mysterious to us.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.580]   It would be like me saying, hey, let me tell you a mystery.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.560]   The earth is not flat.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.100]   It's round, and if you go to the very edges of it,
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.220]   you will not fall off.
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.480]   But to them, this would have been a mystery,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.920]   that this was something that they didn't know.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.720]   To us, we're like, yeah, I've known that for a long time.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.520]   But to them, for the longest time,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.840]   all of the Jewish people, or many of them,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.660]   a mystery that Noah, Moses, all of them,
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.840]   for generations past, did not fully know.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.000]   They thought they were uniquely chosen by God,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.760]   that if you said, two, four, six, eight,
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.600]   who does God appreciate?
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   The Jews, the Jews, and that would be how they thought.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.980]   And so Paul says, no, this has been a mystery
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.320]   that they didn't know for centuries past,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.260]   that there's been something done in our midst,
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.820]   and it is this, that God cares and loves
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.700]   of every person who's ever existed.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.100]   He wants everyone to know them.
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.260]   This is the mystery.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.340]   And then he gives us our first point,
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.140]   that Christ in everybody, or Christ in you,
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.320]   and he says, Christ in you gives you this, first point.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   Christ gives us the hope of glory,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.940]   that anyone in the room,
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.180]   and I just want you to think about this.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.380]   You've been a Christian for a long time.
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.520]   If you have Jesus, regardless of what you've done today,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.000]   or yesterday, or emotionally, where you feel,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400]   if you have trusted in Jesus Christ,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.840]   and his death on the cross, and resurrection,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.120]   Paul says, you have the hope of glory
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.800]   through Christ in you right now.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.880]   Speaking of eternity, you have hope in the midst,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.320]   and hope is so powerful.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.680]   And he says, your hope is not just some aimless hope,
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.400]   it is the hope of one day, there's gonna come a day,
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.640]   like Isaac said in that spoken word,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.400]   where God restores everything, he makes everything right.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.620]   That in essence, I mean, the power of hope,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.860]   is that it allows us to endure,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.260]   no matter what the circumstances are.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.920]   It strengthens our patience, or increases our patience.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.880]   Because here's the deal, you and I, spoiler alert,
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.940]   we know who wins.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.940]   We know how this thing ends in the end.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.520]   That in the end, there's gonna come a day,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.920]   where everything's made right, and Jesus wins.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.880]   Jesus wins over death, Jesus wins over sin,
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.120]   Jesus wins over seizures, Jesus wins over cancer,
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.920]   that everything will be made right.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.440]   You will finally be home if you have Christ.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.800]   You'll never stand next to the deathbed of a loved one,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.520]   you'll never attend another funeral,
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.000]   you'll never battle against sin in your own life.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.040]   Racism will not exist, hatred will not exist.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.960]   Jesus wins, and there's gonna come a day,
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.660]   you're gonna see him, if you know him.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.040]   And you're gonna stand before him,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.640]   and you're gonna look into his eyes that are like fire,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.360]   the scripture says, you're gonna see
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.380]   the nail prints in his hands,
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.680]   and he's gonna say, welcome home.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.640]   You're finally home, and the war will be over.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.200]   That we have this hope, Paul says.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.860]   If you have Christ, that's where your hope is.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:12.840]   Hope is powerful, because it allows us to endure singleness,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.920]   heartbreak, shame, whatever we're feeling,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.400]   it allows us to continue to endure.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.820]   Because we have hope.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.640]   Hope fulfilled in Jesus.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.700]   He continues.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:32.200]   And he really tells us how Christ in him
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.480]   gives him not just the hope of glory,
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.320]   but it does something else.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.360]   Here's what he says.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   He, verse 28, Jesus, he is the one that we proclaim,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.680]   admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.580]   so that we may present everyone fully mature,
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.880]   you may have fully complete in Christ.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.720]   To this end, I strenuously contend
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.920]   with all the energy Christ so powerfully works inside of me.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.200]   Who does Paul say is the one,
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.940]   the focal point that we proclaim?
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.800]   It is a pretty easy answer.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.640]   Any idea?
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.460]   Nope.
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.280]   Jesus.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.960]   And it's church, safe answer.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.400]   Jesus is the one.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.240]   I mean, think about this.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.480]   So here's what Paul just said.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.360]   He just said, look, Jesus is the point.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.400]   Jesus is the message.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.600]   Jesus is the means by which, or is the focal point,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.640]   the starting point to everyone that we proclaim.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.880]   Jesus, who do we go to?
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.600]   What is first on God's agenda for humanity?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.800]   Accepting Jesus.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.520]   I mean, the church has like historically
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.420]   been so, done such a bad job at times
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.120]   of doing this right here.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.920]   Like the biggest thing God's concerned with
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.200]   for your non-Christian coworker
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.600]   who's sleeping with their boyfriend,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.840]   or your friend who's gay, or can't stop smoking pot
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.960]   is not stopping smoking pot or their sexuality.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.500]   Jesus is.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.040]   Jesus is the message.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.240]   Jesus is who we proclaim.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.720]   Paul says the starting point for every person
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.160]   is proclaiming the message of Jesus.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.140]   Our job is to point to him.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.420]   Jesus.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.580]   Because what keeps someone out of a relationship with God,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.080]   or out of heaven, is not their sexuality,
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.480]   it's not an addiction,
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.920]   it's not accepting Jesus.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.080]   And he says that's the starting point.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.880]   That's who we push people to.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.760]   That's when we engage with people.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.040]   Do you know who Jesus is?
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.200]   And here's why I think this is so huge for us
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.560]   as we talk and have conversations with non-believing friends
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.040]   or maybe if you're in the room and you're like,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.560]   I'm still figuring this faith thing out.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.800]   Here's what I think you would know if you knew Jesus,
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.640]   if you could see him as who he is,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.200]   as who the Bible presents, you would like him.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.720]   Your non-Christian friends would like him.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.040]   There's parts of Jesus that are honestly
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.560]   pretty irresistible.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.320]   Like who doesn't wanna have rest?
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.040]   Who doesn't wanna find rest for their soul?
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.000]   Jesus says if you're tired and worn out and burned out,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.860]   come to me.
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.440]   How can you resist that?
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.960]   Who doesn't wanna have freedom from guilt and shame?
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.340]   Or who likes to carry around guilt and shame?
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.160]   And Jesus says, I came to deal with that.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.360]   I mean, even like the compassion of Jesus,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.320]   it's like, it's hard not to be drawn to him.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.000]   This week we're celebrating Easter
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.280]   and all over the world, billions of people
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.960]   will gather together and they're gonna focus
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.520]   on the death and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.280]   And even in the cross, we see this like crazy compassion
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.840]   of Jesus where Luke tells us in the 23rd chapter,
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.680]   Jesus is on the cross.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.280]   He's been nailed into wood behind his hands
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.480]   and he looks down and his compassion is even there
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.040]   where he says, Father, forgive them
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.160]   for they know not what they are doing.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.480]   Speaking of as he looks down at these Roman soldiers
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.520]   and it's like, I think they knew what they were doing.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.680]   They've done this a lot of times.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.040]   I think they know exactly.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.920]   He says, look God, when it comes for them
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.600]   to give an account for everything they've ever done in life,
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.760]   would you not hold this against them?
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.720]   Would you not hold this that they crucified your son,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   that they crucified Jesus?
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.040]   I mean, even the generosity of Jesus is like really hard
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.000]   not to be drawn to.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.560]   Generous people in general are like,
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.920]   you just like to be around him.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.680]   It's hard to not like someone who's generous.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.520]   Have you noticed this?
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.640]   Like you just kinda, if they're generous with their time
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.600]   or their money, they're like, yeah, let me serve you.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.920]   Or they're like, hey, I got dinner.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.800]   It's like, I'd like to hang out with you some more.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.800]   We got a dinner tomorrow and the next day.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.560]   It's just hard not to be,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.640]   or not to like someone who's generous.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.040]   And I mean, another portrait you'll probably hear
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.880]   this weekend of just Jesus on the cross
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.760]   and how insanely generous he is.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.960]   That I'm here to pay for everyone's sin.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.400]   Anyone who wants the free gift, I've paid for it.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.720]   They can have that.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.160]   Regardless of what they do,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.600]   regardless of what they've ever done.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.760]   I mean, on the cross, he's sitting there
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.560]   and there's a thief behind him or beside him.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.560]   Who asked Jesus for a favor.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.480]   In his dying breaths, he looks over and says,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.400]   Jesus, I haven't really lived a good life.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.160]   I'm here for stealing or murdering.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.760]   And I'd like to ask you a favor.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.920]   Will you remember me when you come into your paradise?
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.200]   And Jesus doesn't look at him and go, nice try.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.080]   After living your entire life away from me,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.520]   you think I'm gonna let you in?
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.360]   That's funny.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.200]   Nice try, buddy.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.440]   He doesn't say that at all.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.000]   I mean, what could the guy even offer?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.160]   In his life.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.400]   I promise Jesus, I'll never do it again.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.160]   From this point on, I'm so sincere.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.720]   I mean, nothing.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.320]   And Jesus looks at him and he says,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.760]   today, you'll be with me in paradise.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.040]   I mean, there's a level with Jesus,
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.120]   it's pretty irresistible.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.800]   So we as the church, we just get out of the way
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.280]   and we point them to Jesus.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.880]   Do you know this Jesus?
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.000]   Do you know this God who loved you enough
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.080]   to give his life for you?
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.480]   Who changed the calendar?
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.760]   Who changed the world?
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.320]   What do you think about him?
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.040]   And Paul says, he's the starting point.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.520]   He's the one we proclaim.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.280]   And he really says, who is this to?
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.080]   He says, everyone, three times.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.000]   Admonishing everyone.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.400]   If you have the NIV, they removed one of the everyone's.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.160]   Not sure why, but they did.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.800]   Admonishing everyone, teaching everyone
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.640]   that we may present everyone, every person,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.760]   red, yellow, black, and white, rich or poor.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.160]   We admonish, we tell everyone about Jesus.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.680]   Jim Elliot said that as the church,
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   we are a bunch of nobodies telling everybody
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.040]   about somebody who can save anybody.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:43.880]   I love that.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.320]   We are a bunch of nobodies telling everybody
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.720]   about the only one who's a somebody
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.680]   who can save anybody or anyone.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.960]   Paul answers also how he did this.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.600]   Like, what moved you, Paul?
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.520]   Paul's sitting there and he's saying,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.960]   this is what drives my life.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.520]   I tell everyone about Jesus.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.080]   I wanna proclaim Jesus first and foremost,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:11.080]   and Christ powerfully works within me to do this.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.200]   But like, what was behind Jesus sharing?
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.720]   I mean, Paul sharing Jesus with everyone he encountered.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.440]   Christ, inside of him.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.200]   100 years ago, 101, I believe, actually,
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.120]   in two weeks, there was an event that took place
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.200]   that really shook the world,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.440]   and it was the sinking of the Titanic.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.200]   And on the Titanic, which I'm sure everyone knows about,
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.480]   saw the movie, and on that boat,
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.760]   there was a man who got on there,
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.040]   and his name was John Harper.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.520]   And he was a famous pastor from the UK,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.520]   and he was going to speak at a guy named D.L. Moody,
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.360]   who's in Chicago.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.960]   He was going to speak at a church in Chicago.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.280]   And he was getting on a boat to get over there.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.840]   And he got on with his six-year-old daughter,
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.160]   and he had lost his wife, actually,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.400]   in delivering their child.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.240]   He was a widow.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.760]   And he and his six-year-old daughter get on the boat,
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.960]   and they're going over on the Titanic.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.600]   And then on April 14th, around midnight,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.600]   as we know, they hit an iceberg,
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.880]   and the ship began to go down.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.760]   And people who survived say that John Harper
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.760]   ran all over the deck saying,
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.360]   "Women and children, and those who don't know Jesus,
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.440]   "on the lifeboats."
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.920]   And then he took his six-year-old girl, and he took her,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.160]   and they had a spot in the lifeboat, for both of them,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160]   because he's a famous pastor, he's a widow,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.000]   and so both of them had a spot.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And he kisses his six-year-old girl,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.880]   and says, "I've gotta go, but I'll see you again someday."
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.920]   And he leaves her, and he voluntarily,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.000]   at a time when people are trying to buy their way
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.240]   onto a lifeboat, he gets off of the lifeboat,
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:59.000]   and he goes back and continues telling people about Jesus.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.920]   And then as the boat goes down, he jumps into the water
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.960]   and begins swimming with his life jacket on
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.880]   from person to person, saying, "Do you know Jesus?
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.000]   "Are you saved?"
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.400]   And then he would explain the gospel if they didn't.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.200]   And he came up to one man who said,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.920]   "No, I don't, and I don't want to."
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.440]   And he's holding onto a piece of wood,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.520]   and John Harper says, "Take my life jacket,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.920]   "because you're gonna need this more than I do."
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.560]   And he gives him his life jacket, and he swims off,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.720]   he continues to tell people.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.400]   And then at one point, the waves brought him back
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.200]   to this man he'd given his life jacket,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.520]   and he said, "Are you saved?
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.720]   "Do you know Jesus?
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.200]   "Have you trusted him?"
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.000]   And he says, "I haven't, but I want to."
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.560]   And he led him to Christ, and then John sank, and he died.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.200]   There were six people that were rescued
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.080]   from the 1500 in the water, and one of them was this man.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.760]   And he stood up three years later
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.280]   at a survivor's meeting in Canada,
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.700]   and they all shared their stories, and he said,
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.040]   "I am the last convert of John Harper.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.140]   "I was saved twice that night,
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.960]   "once for eternity, and once for this life,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.060]   "all because of a man who could've taken an easy way out,
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.660]   "but said, 'Everyone lives forever somewhere.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.200]   "'How can I not go in?'"
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.540]   They've got bigger issues
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.320]   than just how much life they have left here.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.280]   They've got eternal life awaiting them.
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.320]   And the reason I think that's powerful to me
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.600]   is I just was praying and thinking on this week
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.840]   in light of this passage,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.380]   it's like, what was the driving force behind John Harper?
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.040]   I mean, it's the same driving force behind Paul,
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.160]   that it wasn't just John's a really great guy,
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.280]   loves the water, it wasn't that at all.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.120]   I feel like that's not a good joke.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.080]   Moving on, it wasn't that at all.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:59.240]   It was Jesus, like, you know who loved those people
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.300]   more than John?
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.280]   Jesus.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.740]   Enough to move inside of one of his servants and say,
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.780]   "Go tell 'em, go tell 'em you're gonna be with me forever.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.640]   "Go tell 'em they can be with me forever."
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.240]   Like, he didn't jump in the water, 'cause he was like,
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.640]   "Maybe I'll get into heaven then."
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.120]   He jumped in the water to get others to heaven.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.040]   And the same thing is true with Paul.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.560]   Who loved those Colossians more than Paul?
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.500]   Jesus.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.480]   And he wants to take your life and my life
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.200]   and powerfully work through it to proclaim him,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.400]   to proclaim hope, to proclaim eternal life
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.560]   and abundant life in this one for anyone who will let him.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   He then gives us really even more insight, Paul does,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.160]   into how Christ works inside of him,
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.720]   of how Christ gives him the ability to live this new life.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.060]   He picks it up in verse one of chapter two.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.160]   I want you to know how hard, Paul's speaking,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.760]   I am contending with you, for you,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.640]   and for those at Laodicea,
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.760]   and all those who have not met me personally.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.520]   Scholars kind of across the board agree
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.720]   when he says contending, he's sitting in a prison cell
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.960]   and he's pointing to prayer.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.280]   That Paul says, I want you to know how hard I'm praying
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.600]   for you people, even though you've never met me before,
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.280]   and I'm praying that God would allow you,
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.240]   that my goal is that you would be encouraged in heart
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.560]   and united in love.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.360]   And in reading this, I was like so just amazed
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.080]   at how much love Paul has.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.600]   I mean, I've never met you people,
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.840]   but I'm spending hours in this little prison cell
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.920]   praying that you would be encouraged in heart,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.000]   encouraged in love, even though I've never met you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.040]   I mean, Paul, most of us don't pray for our friends
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.600]   or family unless they're sick.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.120]   And Paul's going, I've never met these people,
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.520]   but I am just on my face in front of God,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.600]   praying that they would be not just anything,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.680]   but encouraged and united in love.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.760]   I mean, it becomes further even, wow, that's crazy love,
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.720]   when you contrast it with Paul's former life.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.320]   I mean, Paul was the artist formerly known as Saul.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.200]   Remember Saul?
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.280]   Saul was the guy who tried to stomp out
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.480]   the Christian movement, who literally head up
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.080]   persecuting and killing Christians,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.280]   going around trying to stomp out Jesus.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.480]   And then all of a sudden, one day he's on the road
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.960]   and on his donkey and Jesus knocks him off and says,
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.560]   you're gonna come, that's a true story,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.000]   you're gonna come work for me.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   Not like a donkey metaphor, he got knocked on his donkey.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:24.040]   Anyways, so Jesus says, you're gonna come work for me.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.240]   You're gonna come serve me.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.440]   And his life was radically changed.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   But I mean, still, I mean, how terrible or terror filled
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.400]   was Saul that even after he converts,
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.280]   he goes to Jerusalem to meet up with the other disciples
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.360]   and they like won't let him in the house
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.240]   'cause they're like, it's Saul, oh my gosh,
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.680]   everybody hide, shh.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.760]   And they won't let Paul in who's saying,
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.080]   I became a Christian.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.240]   And yet years later, this man who had murdered people
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.080]   in his past is now saying, I'm just begging God on my knees,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.800]   I haven't met you yet, I can't wait to,
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.560]   that you would be filled with encouragement,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.200]   filled with love for one another.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.560]   And so that, here we go, the rest of verse two,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.280]   you may have the full riches of complete understanding
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.200]   in order that they may know the mystery of God,
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.640]   namely Christ, in whom are hidden all treasures
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.120]   of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.680]   So I'm praying that as we know,
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.240]   or as we talked about in the weeks before,
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.200]   Colossians was like a place where they had
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.560]   all these competing ideas.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.720]   It was like we said, Austin, like keep Austin weird,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.480]   keep Colossi weird, where there were all these different
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.920]   ideas about, hey, what does God want?
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.040]   And yes, Jesus, but add some other things.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.200]   And he says, no, I'm praying that you would know
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.120]   you're complete in Christ.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.600]   That's really the whole message of Colossians,
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   if you write in your Bible.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   He uses complete 30 times, more than any other letter.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.800]   That you're complete, you have the complete riches
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   of understanding.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.400]   I tell you this, verse four, so that no one may deceive you
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.720]   by fine sounding arguments, that no one will come up
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.360]   and say, yeah, Jesus, but what about if the two of you
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.760]   are on a desert island, and that no one would deceive you
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.840]   with plausible arguments, that you would know
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.160]   Jesus is enough.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.040]   Jesus is enough.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.800]   Whatever you're walking through,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.600]   that you would know Jesus is enough.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.440]   Verse five, that for though I'm absent in body with you,
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.160]   I'm present with you in spirit, and I delight to see
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.400]   how disciplined you are, and how firm your faith
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.560]   in Christ is.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.320]   It doesn't say how disciplined.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   We were talking about this as our team today.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.680]   I delight to see how disciplined you are,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.640]   and firm your faith in Christ is.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.680]   He's not saying how disciplined, like, hey,
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.000]   you get up every single morning at 5 a.m.,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.080]   and you have a quiet time for the next four hours,
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.760]   then you start your prayer life in the next six hours.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.080]   He's not saying that.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.560]   Those are great things.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.480]   You have a great schedule, I guess, if you do that, kind of.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.120]   But he's not saying that by discipline.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.440]   He's speaking to a group of people that don't have Bibles.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.080]   He's saying, look, I want you to hold on
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.720]   that Jesus is enough.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.640]   Jesus is enough.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.680]   He paid for everything.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.520]   You don't need to add anything to it.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   Be disciplined, stand firm.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.120]   I wanna come and see that you believe Jesus is enough.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.640]   There's nothing that needs to be added.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.120]   There's nothing that can change that.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.120]   Jesus is enough.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.560]   Hold on to that.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.120]   Don't let anything slip into that.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.240]   Jesus is enough.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.280]   And stand firm in that.
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.280]   And here's what he says.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.160]   Really, he gives us the key, and really, third point
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.000]   that we're gonna cover tonight,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.800]   the key to living out the Christian life, verse six.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.080]   So then, just as you, I love this verse,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.320]   just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord,
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.040]   continue to live your lives in him.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.120]   Just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord,
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.360]   continue to live your lives in him,
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.160]   which begs the question, how did they receive Christ?
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.200]   Paul, you're saying, look, basically he says,
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.080]   hey, finish how you started.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.680]   The Christian life is finishing how it began.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.480]   That's how you live the Christian life, Paul says.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.920]   Continue to live, well, how did they receive him?
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:13.200]   Total trust, total dependence.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.480]   In other words, they didn't come,
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   God, I'm gonna try to be good,
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.680]   and you on the cross, you pay for a lot of that,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.720]   and so I'm gonna work my way.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.560]   It wasn't that at all.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.840]   It was, God, I'm totally dependent on you
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.640]   if I'm gonna have eternal life.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.000]   I'm totally dependent on you
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.400]   if I'm gonna have a relationship with you,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.480]   because no matter how good I think I am,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.580]   I'm not good according to comparison with you.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.400]   It was total dependence, and Paul says,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.080]   the same way that we live or we get access to eternal life
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.460]   is the same way we live the Christian life.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.640]   And this is so huge, because the Christian life
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.580]   is not just hard, it is impossible.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.120]   It is impossible for you alone.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.360]   The Christian life is not just like,
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.080]   yeah, just try a little harder.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.340]   It's impossible, and Paul says, look,
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.240]   don't get away from this.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.320]   You finish how you started, totally dependent.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.960]   And every moment, moment by moment, dependence.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.200]   God, I can't, but you can.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   I can't walk through the anxiety that I'm feeling
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.440]   as I just look towards not having a job,
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.360]   but you can, and you can through me.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.240]   I'm trusting you, will you help me?
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.600]   This moment by moment, dependent relationship,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.320]   Paul says, that's how you live the Christian life,
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.600]   totally dependent on him.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:46.120]   I think really, Cali, who's my wife's car,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.160]   in some ways is like, continue to be such
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.360]   a illustration of this, where,
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.960]   or this last idea of just keep coming back to him,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.520]   keep coming to him, moment by moment, dependence.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.960]   Dependence, even just as you walk through your day,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.380]   God, will you help me now?
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.720]   God, you know how I'm feeling.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.400]   God, I'm feeling so alone.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.700]   I'm so tired of being single.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.320]   I'm feeling so full of shame
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.160]   that you take all those things, you keep coming to him,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.240]   you keep walking, keep trusting
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.240]   that God is good, his word is true.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.160]   I'm gonna keep trusting you, totally dependent on you,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.720]   moment by moment, keep coming back to him.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.280]   My wife's car, when she got it, she was in grad school,
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.200]   and so she had no money, and so anytime something bad
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.880]   would happen to the car, she was back to Charlie.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.000]   Anytime she got in a wreck, and not even just bad stuff,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.760]   like in keeping the maintenance, Charlie was the one
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.640]   that she would come back to, and he would help
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.880]   kind of walk through, this is what you need to do,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.520]   here's the oil change, every X number of miles,
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.520]   you need to get this done, and he instructed
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.240]   how to maintain this gift.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.520]   Also, when she would get in a wreck,
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.880]   it would go back to Charlie, and she would keep coming
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.240]   back to him on those wrecks, which happened a lot.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.200]   They say something about our driving.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.960]   I'm gonna pay for that later.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.120]   But it's kind of worth it.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.720]   Anyways. (audience laughing)
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.120]   Man, I'm gonna pay more now.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.400]   Gosh, I love you guys, that's what this is about.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   Okay, so she just kept coming back.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.120]   In any situation, this is what she would do.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.800]   If I got in a wreck, I'm coming back to you.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.640]   If I get in trouble, I'm coming back to you.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.240]   When things are going well, I'm coming to you.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.800]   You know how to best care for this gift
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.020]   that you've given me.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.480]   And in essence, that's the Christian life
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.960]   that Paul says, you just keep coming to him.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.160]   If you're walking through shame from adultery
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.760]   committed this weekend, you just keep coming to him.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.160]   If you're walking through just a season of life
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.880]   where you're going, God, I hate where I am right now,
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.040]   you just keep coming to him, tell him that.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.260]   He wants this moment by moment dependence.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.800]   When things are going well, when things are going bad,
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.240]   you continue to keep coming back to him.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.420]   You keep coming and living in relationship with him.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.060]   I mean, if Charlie, who is wicked,
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.380]   it's not personal, Charlie, it's what the Bible says,
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.980]   that he is not compared to God,
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.200]   and just in general, we all are, wicked,
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.640]   knows how to love and care for this girl
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.440]   who he's embraced as a daughter.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.760]   How much more does your heavenly father
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.120]   want you to come to him?
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.640]   I love you enough to die for you,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.520]   will you just keep coming back to me, moment by moment,
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.020]   totally dependent on me.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.240]   Whatever you're walking through,
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.560]   that he's the first person we turn to,
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.480]   that we would keep coming to him.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.920]   There were times where Callie, my wife, again, with the car,
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.640]   she would, something would happen
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.000]   or she'd get a fender bender, and she'd go, oh my gosh,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.740]   she wouldn't bring it back there,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.320]   even though she couldn't afford to have it fixed,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.840]   she'd go, I'll just not drive it for a little while,
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.400]   I feel like there's been too many of these lately,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.340]   and there have, I'm sorry, I'm paying the insurance now.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.200]   But she would just not drive it.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.640]   And then Charlie found out, and he's going,
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.840]   what are you doing, bring that to me,
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.680]   of course I wanna take care of it, I love you.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.640]   I mean, how much more does your heavenly father,
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.000]   when you're walking through and you've blown it,
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.460]   and will you just come to me, I've paid for it.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:55.500]   I wanna tell you how to maintain, how to live out this life,
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.980]   I wanna instruct you from my words, will you come to me,
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.300]   will you keep coming to me, I love you.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.660]   And that's the invitation he gives all of us,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:08.820]   that not just eternal life,
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.820]   but Paul says how we live this life in Christ,
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.300]   totally dependent.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.860]   And I wanna live this way.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:24.900]   I read Paul's words and I go, I wanna have that hope,
[00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.780]   God, will you help me, I wanna have that hope.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.740]   I wanna be fixed on no matter what I'm walking through,
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.700]   I wanna stand firm that there's coming a day
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.220]   where all of this is gonna be behind us,
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.660]   it's gonna be over like that,
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.980]   and the war will be won, I will be home.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.500]   I wanna make sure that I proclaim Jesus first,
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.420]   I don't want anything to get in the way,
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.460]   or make someone think that Christianity's about
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.900]   not smoking or not swearing unless you're in traffic,
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.260]   or not anything, it's about Jesus.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.260]   And I wanna live in dependence on him,
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:06.740]   and I think that's what he wants for all of us.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.700]   I think that's what Paul would say,
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.500]   that's how you can live this life,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.420]   that's how you can live this life.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.700]   And that's the invitation he's given all of us
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.780]   to experience, not eternal life alone, but abundant life.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.940]   I'm gonna pray, we'll close out.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:29.580]   Father, we love you, and man,
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.340]   we need your help to love you more.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:37.460]   Thank you that you haven't left us just to try harder
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.400]   to do what is impossible,
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.100]   but you offer us a way.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.900]   You offer the same way that we got in
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.660]   is the same way we now live out.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.400]   Thank you that you're coming back.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.060]   Lord, we pray that you would come quickly.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.300]   Your bride, the Christ, says, "Come, Lord Jesus."
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.700]   Would you help us to proclaim your son
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.460]   the hope of the world, the hope for those of us
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.940]   who know him in our hearts?
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.520]   Proclaim that he's come, he's coming again,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.080]   he loves humanity enough to die for them,
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.680]   and he offers new life to anyone.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.080]   Just take the free gift.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.400]   Would we be diligent, would you powerfully work in us
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.680]   who know you to take that free gift?
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.600]   We love you, we need you, amen.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.760]   need you. Amen.
