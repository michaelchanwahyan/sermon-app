[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   - Oh, I love it! Amazing!
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Oh, drop the microphone! Let's go!
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   [cheers and applause]
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   What a perfect way to start the next part of a dating series.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   "Just the Way You Are."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   That song was a perfect ending for where we're gonna begin tonight
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   because that song is not only incredibly popular,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   but it's popular because in some ways it really is the cry of every person,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   particularly maybe it resonates with some of the ladies in the room,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   that someone would love you just the way that you are,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and it exploded the Super Bowl.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I mean, that song, I feel like I've heard so many different times
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   because it resonates with so many different people.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And what's interesting is that message of "you're loved right now,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   exactly who you are" is so counter to so many of the messages
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   that we hear in our world about "you're not loved just the way that you are."
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But in order to be loved, you need to be different,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   or you need to change if you were thinner, or if you made more money,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   or if you had more hair, or if you had better hair,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   or different color hair, or anything with hair.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   If you had less weight, more weight, more muscle, whatever that is,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   the world around us screams that these are the things that are valuable,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and if you would just be more this way, then you would be loved.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And we're gonna discuss tonight a topic as it relates really not only to dating,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   but all men and women, and this subject of value,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   and where that comes from, because we live in this culture,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   in a society that has devalued and devalues something that God has assigned
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   extraordinary value.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And any time a culture or a person devalues something that God has declared
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   of incredible value, the outcome is catastrophic.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And so we're gonna go on a little bit of a journey,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and I'm gonna have to set it up with a history lesson
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   that will explain kind of where we're going,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and indicate really what I mean by how dangerous this is.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   In the early 1990s, something took place in a country called Rwanda,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   which was called the Rwandan Genocide.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Probably a lot of you guys saw the movie Hotel Rwanda,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   or you've heard about this, but in a hundred days, think about this.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Like, this is crazy.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   In a hundred days, a million people were brutally murdered.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   A million.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   It was the worst genocide in the history of the world
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   within that small of a time frame.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Enough bodies that would fill up this room, and many others.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And they weren't murdered by some incoming army,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   they were murdered by their neighbors.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Think about that.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   How does that happen?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   A million people.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And what happened was, in Rwanda,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   there were primarily two groups of people.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   A group called Hutus, and a group called Tutsis.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And these two groups had a long history of animosity towards one another,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   and one thinking they were better than the other,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and one thinking that the other was just cockroaches,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   they're less than us, they're not even human.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And eventually, their relationship got so bad,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   that the Hutus, who would use labels and terms for the Tutsis,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   which were the minority in the country, that they're just cockroaches,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   they're not even human.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Eventually, that way of thinking infiltrated their lives and their nation,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   that a civil war broke out.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And in that civil war, all of the Tutsis fled to the edges of the country,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   and the Hutus pursued them and stomped them out on the basis
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   that they are less than human.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And a million people died in less than a hundred days.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   President Clinton said it was the biggest regret of my entire life,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   and my entire presidency, that I did not act sooner.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And the mist was what was going on, because any time, in this case,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   human life, any time a person or a culture devalues or wrongly values
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   something God has declared of incredible value,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   the outcome is catastrophic.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   In Nazi Germany, the same thing took place where devaluing
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   something God had said is of infinite value, humans,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   made in the image of God, and they called women,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   all Jewish women are whores, all of them, and all Jews are rats.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   They're not even human.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   And they exterminated millions of people.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   We did it in our country when slavery existed.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   We said, "Hey, slaves, they're less than human."
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Then we did it with Native Americans.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   They're less than human.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And any time a culture or a person devalues something God says
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   is extraordinarily valuable, the outcome is catastrophic.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And you're probably wondering, "Why are we talking about genocide
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and slavery? Isn't this a dating series? Where am I right now?"
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's so relevant to the topic we're going to discuss tonight,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   because our culture has done something as specifically as it relates to women
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   as we're going to see when it comes to the topic of devaluing.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   What's interesting, as we transition really to the first century,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   when we look at the first century, the context in which Christianity
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   was birthed, so this is really historical, so I'm going to try to make it
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   as interesting and clear as I can.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   What was going on then was not dissimilar from what was going on
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   with the Hutus and the Tutsis.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Only this time, it was not Tutsis that were being declared less than human.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It was women.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   The first century world as it related to women specifically
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and the Roman Empire is a world we cannot even really begin to imagine
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   because it would be so foreign to us.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Infanticide or the killing of infants was so common, millions of baby girls,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   just the girls, were thrown out with the trash because no one wanted
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   to have a baby girl.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   There was a dramatic shortage of women during this time,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   and there were so many men because no one wanted to have a baby girl.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You'd walk past the trash and you'd hear the cries of a little baby girl
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   because girls were of no value according to Roman law and Roman rule.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   They had no rights.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   They had no status.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   First century writing even records a husband right around the time
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   when Jesus was born, and here's what he says.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   He's writing a letter to his wife, and he says, "If you're delivered
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "of a child before I come home, if it is a boy, keep it.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "If it is a girl, discard it."
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   One of the first laws of Rome, the law of Romulus,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   one of the first laws when the empire was formed,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   one of the first things written in the declarer is that any male
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   that is born must be kept.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Any human male, any healthy male that is born must be kept,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   but every household, you only have to keep one healthy female.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   All the rest you can totally discard.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   It was a world that was so foreign, and we cannot even begin to imagine.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Prostitution was legal and encouraged.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It was a form of birth control.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Women had no rights.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And not only that, it became so bad that men were in such power
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   and women were just cattle that at some point marriage started
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   to rapidly decline, and so two times--think about this--
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   two times before the Roman Senate, bills came forward that said,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   "We want to mandate marriage because none of the men would marry."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Why would I marry? I can have sex with the prostitutes all that I want.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And if I marry, all I have to do is take on the obligation
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and responsibilities of a woman.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   So I don't think so. Two different occasions.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   In fact, it was so at the heart of their culture,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   even some of the most famous teachers that anyone in this room
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   probably recognizes taught that women not only just were to be
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   less valued, they actually biologically were less valuable than men.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Here's what Aristotle wrote about women.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He said, "The female is, as it were, a mutilated male."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   How about that? Encouraging for church.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   "For there is only one thing they have not in them, the principle of a soul."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Plato said this, "It is only males who are created directly by the gods
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   and are given souls. Those who live rightly return to the stars
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   or to the heavens. But those who are cowards may be reasoned to have
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   supposed to have been changed into the nature of a woman
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and come back in the second generation.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   That if you lived a right life, then you would go into the heavens,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   but if you weren't good, then you would have to come back as a woman."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I mean, it's laughable, isn't it? But here's what's so crazy.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   This was the world into which Christianity was born,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   into which Jesus appeared. Jewish culture was not much different.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   There are rabbinical teachings or teachings from a rabbi
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   from the first century that say this, "I would rather have the Torah burned
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   than have it given or instructed to a woman."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   How about that for light-hearted? This is a common first century prayer.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   "Blessed are you, eternal God, who has not made me a Gentile,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   a slave, or a woman."
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I mean, think about that. Imagine. What if we started that,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   and that was the way that we started our church services.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   "God, I just want to thank you for not making me a woman.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I'd like to invite all the men in the room to thank God with me
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   that they have not been made."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I mean, 60% of our audience would just step out and walk out.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   But this was the culture and the world into which Christianity was born,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   and it is so far and so hard for us to imagine.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   But then appeared Jesus, and into this world Jesus spoke,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   and He acted in a way that was so revolutionary
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   and was so beyond anything anyone had ever seen.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And then Peter, His follower, showed up, and Peter spoke
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   as they embraced the teachings of Jesus as it related to women,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   and the world would never be the same.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Jesus, one day in John chapter 4, in the Gospel of John chapter 4,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Jesus is speaking with this woman who's a Samaritan woman.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And Samaritans were like half-breeds.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   They were looked down upon in society.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And Jesus is all by Himself, and He's speaking with a woman,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   this half-breed woman, and not just any woman,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   but a woman who had been married five times
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   and was now exchanging sex for rent with her current live-in partner.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And in the first showing of who He is,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   the first time He tells anyone, "I am the Messiah," it's her.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   His disciples walk up, and to us it's like, "Yeah, what's the big deal?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   They're a woman."
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   His disciples walk up, and they're astounded
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   because He's talking to a woman.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They see Him in this conversation, and they go, "He's talking to a woman.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Why is that astounding?"
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Because she's a woman. You don't talk to women.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Men didn't talk to their wives in public.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And He's talking with this woman, and they walk up,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   and here's what it even says.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I mean, I've never noticed this before, but it says this.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   "Just then," verse 27 of chapter 4,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   "His disciples came back, and they marveled
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   that He was talking to a woman,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   but none of them wanted to ask, 'What do you seek?'
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   or 'Why are you talking to her?'"
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He's not only speaking and telling her before anyone else,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   "I am the Messiah,"
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   but He offers her, asks to drink out of her cup.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I mean, this would have been crazy.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Drink out of her cup? Ew, gross.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   She's a Samaritan woman. There's cooties.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   That is disgusting.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Who would drink out of the cup of a dirty woman
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   who's been divorced five times and is exchanging sex?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   That's disgusting.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Who would do that?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   God in the flesh would do that?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I mean, it was like nothing the world had ever seen,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   and nothing His followers had ever seen.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Another day, He's brought this woman.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   This is John chapter 8.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And this woman who had been caught having sex
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   with a man who wasn't her husband
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   is thrown at His feet by these religious leaders,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   and they say, "The law says we should condemn her.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   What do you say?"
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And He goes over there.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   This is like more astounding
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   than any of us will be even able to grab onto.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   He kneels down, He associates,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   and begins to speak with this woman,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   this unclean woman.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And He tells her, "I don't condemn you.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Go and sin no more."
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Jesus not only allowed women to learn,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   He encouraged it.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And I'm telling you,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   we cannot even begin to understand how revolutionary,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   because He believed and He taught
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   that every person, man or woman,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   has dignity because they are made in the image of God,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   and they should be treated as such.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And then Peter shows up.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And Peter, who helps start the early church
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and he gets it rolling,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   and he writes a couple of the letters
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   that we have inside of our Bible,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   he shows up.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And Peter, who watched Jesus do all of this stuff
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   they had never seen before,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   stuff the world around them
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   did not at all encourage or tolerate.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And Peter, who watched it all
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   as he's writing to these pagan men
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   who just became Christians,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   in a world where women are nothing.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Here's what he writes.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And he writes in the context of husband and wives,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   but he says it's about all women
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   based on who they are.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And here's what he says.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   This is 1 Peter 3, verse 7.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   "Husbands, in the same way,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   be considerate as you live with your wives
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and treat them with respect as the weaker partner."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   The word "treat them with respect,"
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   think about this.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Why is that even in there?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Peter, why?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   You're writing the Bible.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Why do you have to write "treat them with respect"?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Everyone knows you should treat them with respect.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   No, they didn't.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Women, Peter, you're telling us I have to treat women?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   But she's a woman.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And Peter said, "You don't understand.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   You are to treat them with respect."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   It's really the word "ascribe to them honor."
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   It's the only time in the New Testament
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   this phrase appears.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   That I want you, when it comes to the women in your life,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   those you are dating,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   those who you took out on a date
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   that maybe you now try to avoid,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   those who you have just spent time with,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   the friends, the girls, all of them,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   he says, "Here's what I want you to do.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I want you to ascribe to them honor."
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And I'm not just saying, "Hey, treat them as equals."
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I want you to honor them.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   How do you honor someone?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   If President Obama came in this room,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   all of us would know how to honor him.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Or if the queen of whatever came in,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   we would know what it is to honor
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   this distinguished person.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   But Peter says, "I want you to treat
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   all of the women in your life with honor."
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I mean, it was revolutionary.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Like nothing they had ever heard or seen.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And he says this, "As the weaker partner,"
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   which ladies, don't get offended,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   it just means guys would probably win in a fist fight
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   or a boxing match if we had one in here.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   He ascribes this, "As the weaker partner,"
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and here's why,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "and as heirs,"
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   heirs was so significant
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   because remember, women could not be heirs.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   "And as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life."
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So Peter says, "Look, I know they cannot be heirs."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Woman and heirs, never been written before.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   That does not go together.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And I know that's the way that things play out here,
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   but I want you to understand something, men.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   They are co-heirs with you of the gracious gift of life.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Maybe not heirs in this Roman kingdom,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   but they are in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And so you are to treat them as heirs.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   That every woman you have ever met
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   is someone who's not only made in the image of God,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   but someone for who Jesus died for on the cross.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Heirs as in remember who her father in heaven is,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   and you treat them in accordance with that.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   That in essence, that you are dating,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   if you are dating someone,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   or if you know someone, the boss's daughter.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   A couple weeks ago, Todd came and spoke,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   and he spoke about just the way that he has any guy
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   who wants to take his daughter on a date, call him.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   If you want to take him on a date, you know.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And I was having lunch with a friend shortly after that,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and he said, "Man, that guy was intense.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   "I don't know that I would want to take his daughter on a date.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   "It's just too much accountability."
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Here's what Peter's saying.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   You're accountable to an even greater
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and even more powerful heavenly father
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   for the ways that you treat them so much so that--look at this--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   so that, in other words, this is going to be contingent on--
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   or the way that you treat them is so important,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   and if you don't do so appropriately,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Wait a second. Peter, you're saying that the way
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   that I treat the women in my life
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   is going to affect whether or not God hears my prayers?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Peter, that's--but she's a woman.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Guys, you're clearly not understanding.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I want you to honor the women in your life
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   and see them as heirs.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   You remember who her father is.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   The head of our marriage ministry today--
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   we were discussing at Watermark--
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   there's a guy who heads up all the marital stuff here,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and he said, "Look, understanding that my wife
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   "is God's daughter
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   "will do more to impact the way I treat her
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   "than 100 marriage books ever has."
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And these teachings were so revolutionary
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   that Paul then shows up--
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   the apostle Paul, who shows up after this--
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and Paul writes this.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   He says, in Galatians chapter 3, verse 26,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   "So in Christ Jesus,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   "you are all children of God through faith.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   "For all of you who are baptized into Christ
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   "have clothed yourselves with Christ."
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And here's it.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   "There is neither Jew nor Gentile.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   "There is neither slave nor free,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   "nor is there male or female,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   "for you are all one in Christ."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   This is the very first time--
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   secular historians say that men and women--
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   this is so crazy--
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   men and women were given equal value by a writer.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   You're looking at it right there.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   You're looking at it.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   This is the very first time in all of human history--
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   secular history says the very first time
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   that we know that men and women were considered equal
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   was when the apostle Paul wrote in his letter to Galatians,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   chapter 3, that man and woman are equal.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   They are one in Christ.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   The Bible gets hit on for being chauvinist,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   or, man, they just don't treat women.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   That would have been so ludicrous in the first century.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I mean, it would have blown people--
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   you think the Bible is chauvinist?
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   That's--yeah, that's a good one.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   I mean, it was crazy the way that they flocked to the church--
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   women--
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   because they were treated like nowhere else in the entire world.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   They were given such an elevated status
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   at a time when women were not elevated in any way,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and it changed the course of human history.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   In today, nations that do not have a Christian influence,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   women are still second-rate citizens.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Malawa Yousafi, this past year,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   a 14-year-old Pakistani girl,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   was shot in the head for advocating for women
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to have education in Pakistan.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   40 million baby girls killed
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   in the last couple decades in China
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   because of the one-child policy, which says,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   look, basically people would have a baby girl,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   and they go, we'll keep her until we can have a baby boy,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   and then she's gone.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   163 million more men in Asia than women
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   because of selective abortion.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   If it shows up a girl, we kill it.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It is so not natural.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   In Saudi Arabia, women cannot drive cars.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And all over where Christ and His people have not touched,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   it still remains the same.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And Jesus showed up and spoke,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   and He changed everything because He said,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   every woman has such extraordinary dignity
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   because she's made in My image
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and is someone I died on the cross for.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   And men, you are accountable to God
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   for how you treat them,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   not just the ones that you date,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   but including the ones that you date.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   It was staggering.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And here's why I think this is so important,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   because we live in a time and a culture
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   that is devaluing women,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and we are headed in a direction fast,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   or they are valuing the wrong thing.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And any time a culture or a person or a people group
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   devalues something that God has said
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   is of extraordinary value to Him,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   the result is catastrophic.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And every day, the message that's sent to women
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   and sent to men is that women are objects,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   take me, use me, trade me in for another one
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   whenever you get done.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   My body determines, or my beauty determines my worth,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   and it is devaluing and discarding
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   everything that Jesus came to establish.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Here's what I mean.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   If you look at the culture and the world around us,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   the movies, ads, everything that you see,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   it's sending a very clear message,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   and it is one of a deteriorating culture.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   I just pulled some of the top songs right now,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   not just any songs, these are the top songs,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and the top five, three out of the top five right now,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and what they say as it relates to the message of women.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And here's what they say.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Here's the first one.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   This is "Talk Dirty" from Jason Derulo.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I don't even know if I can read this.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   "Been around the world, don't speak the language,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   "but your booty don't need explaining.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "All I really need to understand
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   "is when you talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   I'm not even gonna read the rest,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   but you can just read through it.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   This isn't any song.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   These are the most popular songs in America.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   It's crazy.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And if it's not to you,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   it's because you have been indoctrinated
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   and you drunk the Kool-Aid.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   This is unbelievable.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And any time a culture or world--
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   let's go to the next song.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   This is Beyonce and her boo, Jay-Z.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "Stumbled all in the house, back up--"
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I can't even.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Okay, let's go to the next one.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   This is just--
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Timber.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   The big--we're done.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   I mean, just read it.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It's crazy, and this is the message,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and you're going, "Ah, I just like the beat."
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   This is the message,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   and if you think you can listen to something
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   over and over and over again
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   and it not affect the way that you think
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   or the way that you see,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   you're crazy, too, and you drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And our world and our culture around us
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   is deteriorating, and it's sending a message
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   every single day as it relates to women
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   being sexual objects,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   being bitches and whores and hoes.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   And as the church,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   we are not to stand, support, or allow
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   or participate in.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And you may be going, "Oh, what are you--
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   "This is just the culture.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   "It's just kind of art."
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Newsflash.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   We, as Christians, have a superior culture in Christ,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and any culture that is comfortable
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   with calling a woman a bitch or a whore
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   or a sexual toy
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   is an inferior culture.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It really is important.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   It really is, because any time,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   as we talked about with Hootoos and the Tootsies,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   any time that you allow yourself to refer to someone,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   whoever they are, because of their skin color
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   or whatever they are, male, woman, nationality,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   the amount of money that they make,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   any time that you allow to address a label,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   eventually, it gives you permission
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   to treat them in that way.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And it's not just music.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Everywhere that you look, the message is the same.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Women, your bodies are something
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   that you leverage to get a guy.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And depending on how beautiful it is,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   that's the amount of guy you'll probably get
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   or be able to keep.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And guys, women are things to be taken
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   and used and traded in at the end
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   for something better.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   And it is going to destroy the culture.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And men, as Christian men,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   we have to stand up because there's a war going on
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   and we're losing it.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   We're losing it.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   And is it any wonder why pornography in our country,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I mean, you look at this stuff,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   porn is out of control.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Rape is out of control.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It's higher than it's ever been.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Abortion, out of control, higher than it's ever been.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's more common to be raped today
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   than to be a smoker.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Can you believe that?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   It's crazy.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Sex trafficking is exploding in the United States
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and people are going,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   "Man, we really got to get this under control."
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And you look at what entertains the world around us.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And any time a culture celebrates
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   devaluing something that God has said
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   is of extraordinary value,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   the end result is catastrophic.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And it will be for us.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And these things are so important
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   because all of us are being brainwashed.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   All of us, and I know it's like,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, church,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   "we're being brainwashed."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   It is influencing the way that you think.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Guys, I just want to talk to the guys
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   for a few minutes as we kind of give some application
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   to this as it relates to why this is so important,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   especially when it comes to battle of the sexes
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and genders and treating women and women,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   how you can respond and help us.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Guys, a couple weeks ago,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   we read the verse in 1 Corinthians 13
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   that just says this,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   "When I was a child, I talked like a child,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   "I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "When I became a man,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   "I put the ways of childhood behind me."
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And so I want to give just a couple ways
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   that I think we as men in this room,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   especially those who make up the church,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   have got to put the ways of childhood behind us.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Here's the first one.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   You need to change the focus.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Change your focus as it relates to who you are looking for.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   The habit, generally speaking, of Christian men
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   is that they will either come to Christ
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   or they'll just be influenced by the culture around us to go,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   "Okay, so now I'm a Christian,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   "so I still want what I wanted before,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   "which is a supermodel woman who reads her Bible
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   "every day at 6 a.m. and makes me brownies at night
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   "and comes over and does my laundry."
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And that becomes kind of the focus of what we're looking for.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And you are looking for a unicorn.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   They are not out there, and you are not going to find it.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It's true.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And here's all I'm asking,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   is that you would elevate character over curves,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   that that would be the focus for you.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And I hope you marry gorgeous women.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   There's some in the audience right now.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Maybe you should ask them out when we get done.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   But I hope that happens for all of you.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   All the girls are like, "Yes!"
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I really do.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But here's what is so much more valuable.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   So much more valuable.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Character.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Character.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And if you sacrifice character for a bust size,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   whatever bust even is, I'm not even really sure.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   If you sacrifice character,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   you are going to lose.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   The second thing you need to do is change what you're feeding yourself.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   I think this relates really to women and men,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   but you have to watch what you're feeding yourself.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Whether it's the music you're listening to,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   what's coming in and going in your body.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Or pornography.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I don't know, we talk about porn, I feel like, every week.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   I know, maybe you're like, "Yes, you guys do. You need help."
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   But we do it because there's so many in the room around you sitting right now
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   who looked at porn today, and yesterday, and the day before it.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And here's why that's so dangerous.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Because every time you watch porn, you are going to school,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   and you're learning some lessons.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Here's what you're learning.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   A real human body is not good enough.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   One real human body is not good enough.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And your wife's future human body will not be good enough.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And today, you are becoming what you will be as a husband.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   You've got to watch what you're feeding yourself.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And for any of you that may be going to Regen or seeking help,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   women, here is where we need your help.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We need you--I'll start off with this--we need you to change some things.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   We need you to change your target as a person,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   and don't focus on curves for yourself,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   but focus on the character that you maintain,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   which is of so much greater value.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Any guy--if you're going, "Yeah, but I'm not going to get a great guy."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Any guy who does not care about your character and only your curves
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   is not a great guy.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He's a little boy.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   A couple people excited.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   It's true.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And you need to send him home to mommy and his video games.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   I'm being totally serious. I really am.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And then you need to change, I think, your view on three things.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And these three things are really, really important,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   especially maybe the first one for us.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Modesty.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   We, as guys, need your help.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And I know modesty is hard because I feel like the church has given this kind of bad rap
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   about, like, "Yeah, modest is hottest, but not really."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And so we need you to help us.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And modest does not mean frumpy or dressing like grandma.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I'm the most stylish, modest person in the room.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   But modesty--here's what modesty is.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   It's the best definition I know of.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   It is not hiding your body.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   It is revealing your dignity.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   And that is what modesty is.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   And we, as guys, we need your help.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Even here on Tuesdays, we need your help.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And you're going, "Oh, but that's your problem."
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   You're right. We have a problem, and we need your help.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And we will just keep turning the air conditioning up in here
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   until people start dressing modestly.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   I'm totally kidding. Kind of.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I'm totally kidding. Totally kidding.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Although it may be a good solution.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   We need your help. I'm being serious.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   And then your body.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Same thing.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Your view as it relates to your body.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Any guy who is pressuring you to have sex,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   or if you feel a pressure to have sex,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   you're not dating a man.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   You're dating a little boy.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   You need to tell him to go home, too, with his friend.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I was like, nervous laughter.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I'm not sure what just happened.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And then just your value.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   You have such -- I'll just say this to the girls.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I won't be able -- I'll fall short of what I'm about to try to do.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   You have no idea how high your value is.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And I couldn't even begin to describe it.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   But God who sits in heaven says, as my daughter,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   you are of a royal bloodline, and I care so much about you.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Every part of you.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   And your value is so high, I'll die for you
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   before I would want you to degrade yourself or be devalued.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And the world around you is sending you a lie,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   and me a lie, and all of the guys in the room a lie
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   about where your value lies.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I was getting married about a year and a few months ago.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And when you get married, you have to -- you have a wedding.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   And when you have a wedding, you need a wedding ring.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And so I had -- I was getting a wedding ring for my wife,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   now my fiancee then.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And her grandma had these -- had some diamonds that I was given
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   to, like, be a part of that wedding ring, which was awesome.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   I can highly recommend that for any of the guys in the room,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   if you are getting a wedding ring, as though you, like,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   can control that grandma.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   So I am getting these diamonds, and I have a ring made,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and it's amazing.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   I mean, it's perfect.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And at that time, I'm, like, breaking the bank to be able
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   to make this incredible ring.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   And there's not much left in it after that.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It's the most valuable thing that I own, which is so --
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   it's so bizarre, because you're driving around in a car,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   and you're, like, if this thing falls in the couch cushion
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   or in the car, we're done.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   I'm going to have to replace it with a rubber band.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   So we -- I get this ring made, and I give it to her,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and it's perfect.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   She loved it.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   It was exactly what she wanted, and to this day,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   still the most valuable thing we own.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And so I, this past week, had her go, because anything that's
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   of great value, you often want to insure.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And so she goes to get it insured and have it appraised,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   because you have to have an appraisal.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   We were told it was worth X amount of thousand dollars,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   and the guy comes back, and he had appraised it, and he said,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   "I'm sorry it took so long, and I wish I had good news for you,"
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   which is not a great thing to hear at this point in an
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   incident, but these are fake diamonds.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   They're not real.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Shane, you jerk.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   These are fake diamonds.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   It was a lot sadder than this laughing thing that we're
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   experiencing.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Like, what?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Grandma, what?
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   But we eventually said, "Somebody told you a lie.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   These are not real diamonds."
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   The only thing that even makes this ring worth anything is the
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   gold on the band.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   That's the only thing worth something.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And it was like, what?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   And here's why I say that, because we thought, we had been
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   told it was this amount of thousands of dollars.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   We had been told it was very valuable by trusted people.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   We had been trusting in the fact that this thing was of
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   incredible value.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   But when we went to the expert, and we took it to him, he very
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   quickly said, "This is worthless."
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   And I know a lot of us in the room would say that we trust
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   God.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   I trust him.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Hey, if I said, "Hey, who trusts God in here?"
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   "Oh, I trust God."
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   "Who trusts Christ?"
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   "Oh, I trust it in Christ."
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   But if I said, "Do you trust what he has to say as it
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   relates to your future spouse?"
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   You may even say, "Yes."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   And I don't know if you know this or not, but the expert
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   has said, "Hey, this is what's valuable, and this is what's
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   not."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I mean, that's worthless.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Its value is leaving quickly.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Here's what he said.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   He said this in Proverbs 31, which we talk about a lot, where
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   he just said, "Look, charm is deceptive or deceitful.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   It can deceive you.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Some of you have been deceived by a man or woman you thought
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   was charming."
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   And he says, "Beauty is fleeting.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   It's leaving.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   All of us are getting uglier.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   It's depressing, isn't it?"
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   But he said, "A woman," or insert, "man, who has reverence
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   for me, who fears in the posture of their life is to revere me."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   That is a woman or a man who is worthy to be praised, and that
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   is what is of value.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   But that other stuff is not.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   And he, the expert, has spoken.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   And as you and I date and interact, or you date, I'm not
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   dating.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   These are the qualities that are valuable and trusting God will
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   take going, "Look, I'm going to trust that that's what I'm
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   setting my sights on, and I hope everything else falls
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   underneath it.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   But that's what I'm looking for from the God who loves you just
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   the way that you are."
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   I'm going to pray, and the band's going to close this out.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Father, will you help us?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Just dating is a miserable, terrible thing.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   And it is no wonder you didn't speak of it in the Bible,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   because there would have been chapters and chapters.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   And so will you help us just as my friends in the room navigate
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   these waters?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Will you prepare even now a spouse for them?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Will you give them a renewed vision and renewed mind?
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Will you help us as men to lead the way in a culture that is
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   headed downhill fast and devaluing this incredible gift
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   you call your daughters?
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Will you help women in facing the temptation in a culture
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   around us that says sex and your body are things to be
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   leveraged?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Will you help us to be modest?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   We thank you for Jesus who died on the cross, who not only
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   showed us how incredibly loved we are and the teachings he had
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   about women and men, but in the way that he died for all of our
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   sins and came back from the dead.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Thank you that we have new life to walk trusting in your ways,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   not ours.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   We pray all these things in his name, amen.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Well, Jesus showed up and he changed not only the calendar
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   and not only the world's view of women, but he changed many of
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   the lives in this room.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And he introduced and helped us understand even how we have a
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   relationship with God, which I know everyone probably knows or
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   maybe you know, but as Christians believe, it's not good
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   people who go to heaven and trying to be good and bad people
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   are the ones who go to hell.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   But it's forgiven people who go to heaven.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   Fundamentally, to be a Christian means to say, I'm not a good
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   person.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I can't be good.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   I need you.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And if you've never had that conversation or you've never been
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   a part of that, or maybe you just have questions, we have a team
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   down here.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   We'd love to help work through and walk through and be a safe
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   place for you to work through those things.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I hope the guys don't feel discouraged.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   It's hard.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   So ladies, give us a lot of grace as we try to seek.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Give us grace when we are trying to follow Christ's call and kick
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   us to the curb when we're being little boys.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   But we love you guys and we think it's such a joy to get to
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   serve with you.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Go in peace to love and serve him this week.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Amen.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   Have a good week of worship.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   [Applause]
