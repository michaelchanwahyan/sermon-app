1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:24,680
 - All right, let's do it.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,520
 Let's do it.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,360
 What's up, Porch?

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,600
 My Porch Live locations,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,500
 we are introducing tonight and saying a big hello

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,200
 from Dallas, y'all help me out.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,760
 Welcome Porch Live Midland,

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,800
 Porch Live Greater Lafayette,

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,320
 and Porch Live Des Moines, Iowa.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,040
 We are so glad that you guys are tuning in tonight.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,120
 And of course my friends in Dallas, what's up?

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,240
 I'm JD, if we haven't met,

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,480
 I serve as the creative director here at the Porch.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,160
 It's a privilege to be here speaking.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,400
 Dave and Marvin tonight is in College Station.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,520
 Any Aggies in the house?

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,720
 (audience cheering)

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,760
 Speaking of breakaway, so you're stuck with me

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,700
 and I am so pumped.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,840
 Daniel chapter three, we are in this series on God.

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,680
 That's on God.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,220
 We're gonna see that time and time again in this series.

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,640
 Week one, chapter one, we've talked about how Daniel

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,600
 and the people, the Israelite people were different

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,120
 than those that were underneath the Babylonian captivity.

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,500
 They ate different food.

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,020
 Night two, we saw what it looked like

29
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,120
 to have God confidence as Daniel stood before the king

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,240
 and interpreted his dream on God's power and strength.

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,360
 And tonight we're gonna look at what it means

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,480
 to have great faith, not from Daniel,

33
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,960
 but some side characters known as Shadrach,

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,840
 Meshach, and Abednego.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
 But before we go there, I wanna tell you about this week.

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,200
 Me and some friends were sitting in our apartment

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,880
 and we were going through Netflix trying to decide

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,660
 what to watch and there was this show

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,840
 that kind of just caught my eye.

40
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,360
 It was like number one on Netflix at the time

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,800
 called "Is It Cake?"

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,300
 "Is It Cake?"

43
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,300
 And you know, like when you hover over,

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,320
 it's not that good, honestly,

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,800
 but whenever you hover over and like the commercial starts

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,040
 and you're like, you got five seconds,

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,080
 I was like, all right, Netflix, I'll buy it, click.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,480
 And so I start watching this show

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,760
 and if you haven't seen it, the premise of the show

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,200
 is these bakers are in a competition

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,000
 where essentially they have to fool these judges

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,900
 to convince them that what they baked is actually real,

53
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,760
 that it's not cake, that it's not fake, it is a real thing.

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
 And so imagine they would have to make this water bottle

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,400
 look exactly like a water bottle, but instead it's cake.

56
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,760
 And so they have like, whenever they turn around the wall

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,800
 and they're done baking, they have four hours to do it,

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,640
 there's all these different water bottles,

59
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,680
 there's five of them, except one of them is cake.

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,760
 And then the judges in like 20 seconds

61
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,320
 have to pick one through five,

62
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,200
 which one they think is cake.

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
 And so me and all my friends, we're like, it's number two,

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,800
 no, no, it's number five, 'cause it's just shocking

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,440
 how much literal cake can look like a real object.

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,600
 And so we're all putting in our votes.

67
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,340
 And then the way that it's revealed is the host,

68
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,800
 who's interesting if you've seen it,

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,960
 he takes this big knife and kind of like violently,

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,440
 creepily, like he likes it too much.

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,520
 I'm like, bro, chill.

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,880
 He goes over and he's like, is it cake?

73
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
 And I'm like, yeah, come on.

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,500
 And he goes to cut it, and if it's not cake,

75
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,760
 it just hits whatever the thing is,

76
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,640
 and the judge is lost and the baker won.

77
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,200
 And then he'll be like, which one is it?

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
 And he'll walk over and they're all like, no.

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,520
 And then he cuts it and it's so like nice.

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,040
 It's like soothing weirdly.

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
 He cuts it and then reveals on the inside it's cake

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,220
 and everyone's just like, pff.

83
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,300
 So I watched like two episodes,

84
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,160
 I was done with it after that.

85
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,460
 But the point is, I think a lot of us

86
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,480
 are there with our faith.

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,120
 In the same way that these guys are challenged to go,

88
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,900
 is it cake or is it real?

89
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,020
 A lot of times when it comes to our faith,

90
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,900
 we're going, is it real or is it fake?

91
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,580
 Like, is my faith real?

92
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,220
 When I stand before God, will I be seen good,

93
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
 well done, my good and faithful servant?

94
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,980
 Like your faith, your faith has been real, it's been well.

95
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,220
 But just like the cake on the show,

96
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,140
 a lot of times you don't know if your faith

97
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,540
 is actually about it until it's cut into in life.

98
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,780
 With these guys, we'll see that it wasn't cut into,

99
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,380
 it was actually burned into.

100
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,180
 But a lot of times it's until the heat

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,520
 begins to be turned up, the pressure begins to be added on,

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,820
 the stakes begin to be raised higher and higher.

103
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,140
 And in these defining moments in life,

104
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,100
 that is when we realize, man, my faith, all of this talk,

105
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,980
 it was either real or it was fake.

106
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,420
 And our world is only getting, guys,

107
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,140
 our world is only getting more and more to a place

108
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,920
 where you're gonna have to make a decision.

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,500
 And I think the problem is so many people,

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 when that moment comes to display radical faith in God,

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,660
 they crumble and they're marked by conformity

112
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,500
 rather than courage and obedience

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,820
 because they did not take today seriously.

114
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,140
 You don't wanna wait until the fires in life,

115
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,820
 the storms and trials in life to decide, is my faith real?

116
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,260
 It's the decisions you make today.

117
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,720
 It's how you prepare today that prepare you for the moment

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,900
 that when the fires of life come, you'll be ready.

119
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,300
 You don't have to wonder, man, I hope that it's real.

120
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,280
 I hope that my faith is what I've always said it is.

121
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,040
 No, you can know today.

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,300
 We're gonna see in the life of these men

123
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,040
 that you can know right now.

124
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,500
 You don't have to ever question again.

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,700
 And here's why this is relevant to every person in this room

126
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,640
 'cause some of you are like, man, I know my faith is real.

127
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,320
 The reason why this is so relevant to all of us

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,420
 is because even if you think,

129
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,680
 when we look into the deepest parts of our life,

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,120
 there is something that we do that communicates otherwise.

131
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,100
 So many times our life is marked by fear, worry,

132
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,300
 or even living in our own faith, our self-faith,

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,240
 rather than faith in God.

134
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
 And that's what we're gonna see in this story.

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,040
 We're gonna see what it looks like to have a faith on fire.

136
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,880
 If you're a note taker, if you like alliterations,

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,840
 all that stuff, faith on fire

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,400
 is the title of tonight's message.

139
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,540
 And we're gonna do that by tackling Daniel chapter three.

140
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,440
 And so, wanna go and give a heads up.

141
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,240
 This is a long story,

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,720
 but I will say, if you tell me, man, the Bible is boring,

143
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,360
 especially the Old Testament,

144
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,480
 I do not know what book you are reading

145
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,440
 because this is one of my favorite stories of all time.

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
 Like this is a movie.

147
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,220
 When I read this, I am like,

148
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,720
 I cannot wait to get to the next sentence

149
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,480
 because it is so good.

150
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,040
 And so lean in, although it's a lot of words,

151
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,760
 what we're gonna do is every day,

152
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,600
 if you don't have a way that you do your quiet time,

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,040
 if you kind of just open up and point,

154
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,480
 I'm gonna give you just a good way

155
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
 to know how to study your Bible.

156
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 Write this down, observation, interpretation, application.

157
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,520
 Observation, interpretation, application.

158
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,440
 That when you open up a passage,

159
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,240
 when you hear, hey, the porch is going through

160
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,200
 a book of the Bible, you wanna,

161
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,040
 that should be an indicator, oh, okay,

162
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,520
 so what we're gonna do is we're gonna read the text,

163
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,160
 we're gonna observe what it's saying,

164
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,980
 we're gonna interpret it by seeing what the author's intent,

165
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,360
 what was the author trying to communicate to me?

166
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,960
 What does this, how do I interpret this for my life?

167
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,320
 And then we're gonna apply it.

168
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,980
 Knowledge puffs up.

169
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
 We don't want just more knowledge,

170
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,640
 we want to put it into practice.

171
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,720
 And so today, we're simply gonna look at this story,

172
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,200
 observe it, interpret it, and apply it.

173
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,400
 And so I'm gonna kind of summarize verses one through 13,

174
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,560
 and then we'll read 14 to the end.

175
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,480
 With me, everyone with me?

176
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
 With me?

177
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,520
 All right, sweet, here we go.

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,480
 Daniel chapter three, one through 13.

179
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,040
 What you need to know, Nebuchadnezzar,

180
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 he's kind of out there.

181
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,880
 Like at the end of every chapter, he's like,

182
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,280
 "You have the most high God."

183
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,760
 And the next one, he's mad again.

184
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,080
 He's like, "Bow down to me."

185
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,960
 In this instance, he goes and he acts all crazy,

186
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,400
 and he's like questioning people's loyalty.

187
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
 People have been whispering in his ear, and he's like,

188
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,120
 there's like, I think a rebellion's going on,

189
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
 and so what does he do?

190
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,020
 He makes an idol of gold 90 feet high.

191
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,860
 That sounds logical.

192
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,640
 So he builds this huge self-idol of himself,

193
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,080
 and it's this moment where he kind of makes the people

194
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,080
 serve him both politically and spiritually.

195
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
 They were displaying their political loyalty

196
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,380
 and their spiritual loyalty to him,

197
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,800
 because he's the baddest king of the time at this time.

198
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
 So what he says is, "Hey, I've got all these instruments.

199
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
 "I've got this band over here.

200
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,720
 "They're the best in the nation.

201
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,960
 "They're gonna play some music,

202
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,600
 "and then you're gonna drop down and worship this idol."

203
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,520
 When you read this, a lot of you are too familiar with this.

204
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
 You are used to dropping when you hear the music

205
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,640
 in the clubs, but can you imagine you're just walking around

206
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,280
 with like baskets of bread and you hear,

207
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,720
 "Give me something," you know, you drop down.

208
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
 That's what I picture, you know,

209
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,840
 the bass is like hitting, you know,

210
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,720
 the saxophone's playing.

211
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,960
 And so they're bowing down to the idol.

212
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,480
 Oh, and by the way, if you don't,

213
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,620
 I'm gonna throw you in a fiery furnace, okay?

214
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,440
 Casual, so everyone bow.

215
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,600
 The reason why he's doing this,

216
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,720
 because he wants to see who's loyal to me.

217
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,920
 Who will bow?

218
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,040
 And if you're caught standing, you will soon be burning.

219
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
 That's what he says.

220
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
 And so as this is going on, everything's going good,

221
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,060
 everything's going smooth, the king gets word

222
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,400
 that there are certain Jews, these wise men go to him,

223
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,560
 they're like, "Oh, mighty king, didn't you say

224
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,940
 "that like once they hear the music,

225
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,080
 "they're supposed to bow down to you

226
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,520
 "to display their loyalty?"

227
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,960
 He's like, "I did say that."

228
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,920
 And there's like, there's certain Jews,

229
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,760
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who aren't doing it.

230
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
 And he's like, "What?

231
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,420
 "Bring them to me.

232
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,260
 "Let me talk to them.

233
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,400
 "Let me at them."

234
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
 So he's all fiery, he's hot.

235
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,060
 He brings in these three men to stand before him

236
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,640
 and to plead their case.

237
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,580
 And that's where we are in the story.

238
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,500
 Verse 14.

239
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,200
 Nebuchadnezzar said to them,

240
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,960
 "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

241
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,180
 "that you refuse to serve my gods

242
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,480
 "or to worship the gold statue I have set up?

243
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,200
 "I will give you one more chance to bow down

244
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,860
 "and worship the statue I have made

245
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,040
 "when you hear the sound of the musical instruments.

246
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,180
 "But if you refuse, you will be thrown immediately

247
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,560
 "into the blazing furnace.

248
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,560
 "And then what god will be able to rescue you from my power?"

249
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,640
 He bowed to sea.

250
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,720
 Verse 16.

251
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,040
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied,

252
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,080
 "Oh, Nebuchadnezzar,

253
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,160
 "we do not need to defend ourselves before you."

254
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,000
 I love this part.

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
 This is so funny to me, I don't know why.

256
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,

257
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,400
 "the god whom we serve is able to save us.

258
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,000
 "He will rescue us from your power."

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
 Your majesty, your most loyal king.

260
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,640
 "But even if he doesn't,

261
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,280
 "we want to make it abundantly clear to you,"

262
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,880
 again, your majesty, you know, we're just little peasants,

263
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,940
 "that we will never serve your gods

264
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,820
 "or worship the gold statue you have set up.

265
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,600
 "Nebuchadnezzar was so furious

266
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,260
 "with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

267
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,000
 "that his face became distorted with rage.

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,860
 "He commanded that the furnace be heated

269
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,960
 "seven times hotter than usual.

270
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,820
 "Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army

271
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,540
 "to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

272
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,620
 "and throw them into the blazing furnace.

273
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,000
 "So they tied them up, threw them into the furnace,

274
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 "fully dressed in their pants, turbans, robes,

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
 "and other garments,"

276
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,400
 that's apparently important to know.

277
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,800
 "And because the king in his anger

278
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 "had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace,"

279
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,660
 this is crazy,

280
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,680
 "the flames killed the soldiers

281
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,360
 "as they threw the three men in.

282
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,120
 "So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied,

283
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,000
 "fell into the roaring flames.

284
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,200
 "But suddenly,"

285
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,560
 Mufasa, you know that part?

286
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,480
 Shake it.

287
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,480
 "But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,760
 "and exclaimed to his advisors,

289
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,740
 "'Hey, yo, didn't we tie up three men

290
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,180
 "'and throw them into the furnace?'

291
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,560
 "And they're like, 'Yeah, it just happened, King,

292
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,480
 "'like five minutes ago.'

293
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,160
 "'Yes, your majesty, we certainly did,' they replied.

294
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,380
 "'Look,' Nebuchadnezzar shouted,

295
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,100
 "'I see four men, unbound,

296
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,820
 "'walking around in the fire, unharmed.'

297
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,880
 "And the fourth looks like a god.

298
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,680
 "Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could

299
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,840
 "to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted,

300
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
 "'Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

301
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,340
 "'servants of the most high God, come out, come here.'

302
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,060
 "So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of the fire.

303
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,660
 "Then the high officers, officials, governors,

304
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,480
 "and advisors crowded around them

305
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,880
 "and saw that the fire had not even touched them,

306
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,220
 "not a hair on their heads were singed,

307
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,300
 "and their clothing was not scorched.

308
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,620
 "They didn't even smell of smoke."

309
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,360
 That's crazy.

310
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,900
 "Then Nebuchadnezzar said,

311
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,220
 "Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

312
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,720
 "He sent his angel to rescue his servants

313
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
 "who trusted in him.

314
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,720
 "They defied the king's command and were willing to die

315
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,480
 "rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.

316
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,040
 "Therefore I make the decree,

317
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,840
 "if any people, whatever their race or nation or language,

318
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,820
 "speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach,

319
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,260
 "and Abednego, they will be torn limb from limb."

320
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,700
 Here we are again with the tearing from limb to limb.

321
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
 This guy needs to go see a counselor.

322
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,740
 "And their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble.

323
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,860
 "There is no other God who can rescue like this.

324
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,500
 "Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego

325
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,900
 "to even higher positions in the province of Babylon."

326
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
 Woo, okay, I need a drink.

327
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,080
 Thank you.

328
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,980
 So tonight, we're observing, like I said,

329
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,280
 we're observing this story

330
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,720
 and we're learning what it looks like

331
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,220
 to have a faith that's on fire for God.

332
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,400
 And so right into it.

333
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,280
 Faith on fire, number one.

334
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,160
 Faith on fire will look different.

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,040
 People who have a faith on fire are built different.

336
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,220
 All right, I'm gonna tell you,

337
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,740
 if you are a Christian, you will look different.

338
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,120
 Remember that the king has asked everyone to bow down

339
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,520
 and there's a reason why these three guys stood out.

340
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,280
 Because when everyone bowed, they were standing.

341
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,540
 So because of that, Nebuchadnezzar said to them, verse 14,

342
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,980
 "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

343
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,260
 "that you refuse to serve my gods

344
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,200
 "or to worship the gold statue I have set up?

345
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,140
 "I will give you one more chance to bow down."

346
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,920
 You need to know this about faith.

347
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,600
 Real faith will produce real testing.

348
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,680
 If you are gonna be marked by real faith,

349
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,080
 you better be ready to be accompanied by real testing.

350
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,480
 They always go hand in hand

351
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 because the more your faith builds,

352
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,160
 the more that testing is used to strengthen your faith

353
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,760
 and they go hand in hand.

354
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,400
 God uses these moments of testing

355
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,780
 and trying to build your faith on him.

356
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,580
 We see that all throughout scripture.

357
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,120
 You've probably experienced that in your life.

358
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,100
 And if you're gonna be a Christian in the world today,

359
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,920
 you're gonna have your is it true moment.

360
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
 What do I mean by that?

361
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,980
 King Nebuchadnezzar, he looked at these three guys

362
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,660
 and he said, "Hey, is it true

363
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,340
 "that you won't bow down to me?

364
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,200
 "Is it true?

365
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,820
 "And if you're gonna be a Christian

366
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,040
 "marked by radical faith and obedience,

367
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
 "you're gonna be asked, hey, is it true

368
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,980
 "that you only believe that there's just male and female?"

369
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,600
 Is it true that you're actually against pro-choice

370
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,820
 and you are for the sanctity of life?

371
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,740
 Hey, is it true that you believe

372
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,620
 that Jesus is the only way to heaven?

373
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,140
 Hey, is it true that you believe

374
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,940
 that same-sex marriage is wrong?

375
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,660
 There's gonna be all these different things

376
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,880
 that the world, your jobs, your friends,

377
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,640
 people that you encounter on trips

378
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,300
 and different moments of life are gonna ask you,

379
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,300
 hey, is it true blank?

380
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,320
 And if you wanna be marked by real faith,

381
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,100
 you have to be ready to be tested and in the testing.

382
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,960
 Our job as Christians is to look different.

383
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,120
 It's surprising to me, the church, I think,

384
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,460
 has slowly sought so hard to reach the world

385
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,740
 that it's slowly starting to look like the world

386
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,860
 and you can't tell a difference

387
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,700
 between Christians and the world.

388
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,100
 And so because of that, we've become soft

389
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,380
 as Christians, we don't like the tension

390
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,940
 of looking different.

391
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,820
 Actually, when the world doesn't agree with us,

392
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,320
 we're hurt by it, we're surprised by it.

393
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,700
 And it's so shocking to me that we as Christians

394
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,280
 are so torn up when the world is mad at us,

395
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,140
 when our coworkers talk about us,

396
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,380
 when we're treated differently,

397
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,420
 it's so surprising because Jesus says it point blank

398
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,300
 that this will happen for the believer.

399
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,060
 John 15, Jesus says, hey, when the world hates you,

400
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,860
 remember that it hated me first.

401
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,660
 Then he goes on to say, if you were of the world,

402
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,340
 the world would love you as its own.

403
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,300
 But because you are not of the world,

404
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,980
 but I chose you out of the world,

405
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980
 therefore the world hates you.

406
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,400
 And I know, take it from me, a fellow people pleaser,

407
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,900
 my people pleasers, you're like, but no,

408
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,580
 I want everyone to love me.

409
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,240
 No haters, good vibes only, positivity.

410
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,600
 But it cannot be at the expense of your faith.

411
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,660
 You cannot seek to please man over pleasing God.

412
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,500
 We see here that Christians living out a radical faith

413
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,780
 are called to look different.

414
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,360
 TA, one of our teaching pastors here at Watermark

415
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,480
 said something two Sundays ago that really stuck with me.

416
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,740
 He said, hey, if your life makes perfect sense

417
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,500
 to the unbeliever, then something is terribly wrong.

418
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,780
 If your life makes perfect sense to the unbeliever,

419
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,820
 then something is terribly wrong.

420
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,720
 And if right now, I think if I followed you

421
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,660
 into some of your workplaces and I asked your coworkers,

422
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,280
 hey, he's a Christian, why don't you wanna be like him?

423
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,940
 They'd be like, he's a Christian?

424
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,500
 They'd be like, wait, why would I need God

425
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,960
 when clearly he doesn't?

426
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,500
 You have to ask yourself, if right now I went

427
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,980
 into your spaces of influence and I asked the people

428
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,740
 around you, what's different about this person?

429
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
 What would they say?

430
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,740
 Would you look any different to the world?

431
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,820
 Because if you're a Christian today,

432
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,740
 you should not feel like you are home.

433
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,060
 You should feel out of place.

434
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,880
 Why?

435
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,540
 Because this isn't our place.

436
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,020
 We live for heaven.

437
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,540
 That's our home.

438
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,780
 So you should not feel like this is it.

439
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,100
 Christian, this is not it.

440
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,740
 There is so much more.

441
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,340
 And so until then, yeah, you're gonna feel

442
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,860
 a little uncomfortable.

443
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,660
 Can I get a volunteer like right in the middle?

444
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,500
 Is that Gabe?

445
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,320
 There you are, yeah.

446
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,620
 Stand up, Gabriel.

447
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,460
 Stand up.

448
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,460
 (audience cheering)

449
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,220
 How you feeling?

450
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,060
 Nervous?

451
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,420
 A little uncomfortable.

452
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,700
 Everyone's looking at you.

453
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,780
 You're probably starting to sweat

454
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,480
 in different regions of your body.

455
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,440
 ♪ Welcome to my life ♪

456
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,400
 Yeah, it's hard up here, okay?

457
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
 See how it feels?

458
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,320
 It's getting a little more.

459
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,280
 Everyone else is sitting.

460
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,760
 And right now there's something in you naturally

461
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,680
 that's wanting to sit.

462
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,520
 Don't.

463
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,200
 (audience laughing)

464
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,840
 I know we read this and we're like, wow,

465
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,080
 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

466
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,440
 what great men of faith.

467
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,000
 I can tell you when everyone else went down,

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
 I bet it was hard to stay up.

469
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,520
 I bet it felt uncomfortable.

470
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,800
 I bet that they began to sweat and get nervous.

471
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
 You can sit down.

472
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,480
 Give it up for Gabriel real quick.

473
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,480
 (audience cheering)

474
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,480
 But here's the reality, guys.

475
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,960
 When you go to work, when you go to your master's program,

476
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,080
 when you go to your sphere of influence,

477
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,680
 back home to your family, that should be your reality.

478
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,120
 If you look just like everyone else,

479
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,480
 I would ask you, is your faith real?

480
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,560
 Because we as Christians, what we see here

481
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,040
 is that it's not a matter of if, but when.

482
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,840
 You will experience testing

483
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,200
 because you will look different.

484
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,920
 But remember, you are not alone.

485
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 There is a Savior, His name is Jesus,

486
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,740
 who walked the walk for us, that the world hated Him too.

487
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,280
 And like we sung earlier, He hung on the cross,

488
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,160
 He defeated sin, and He rose from the grave.

489
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,080
 So that way, today, when the world looks at us

490
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,560
 and sees that we're different, it's like, is it true?

491
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,920
 I'm gonna give you one more chance or you're fired.

492
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,080
 I'm gonna give you one more chance

493
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,680
 or you're never hanging out with us again.

494
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,920
 I'm gonna give you one more chance

495
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,560
 or this relationship is over.

496
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,400
 When you get to that moment, will you stand or will you bow?

497
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,880
 There are people in this room who have lost jobs

498
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
 because they have stood up for their faith.

499
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,240
 And I wanna say, I'm so proud of you.

500
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,380
 God is so honored by that.

501
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,440
 The world is looking and they're watching.

502
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,440
 And when you're tested in how you respond,

503
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,640
 that's what they're attracted to

504
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,600
 and that's what they're following.

505
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,160
 So I'm asking you, does your faith look any different?

506
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,120
 To these moments, these defining moments that are hard

507
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,580
 and decision has to be made,

508
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,240
 the Christian's response should be faith encouraged.

509
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,900
 The world's response, fear and conformity.

510
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,360
 Everyone else was found bowing down, listening to the king,

511
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,480
 but the Christian stood in faith.

512
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,940
 They said, we will not bow.

513
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,200
 How did they have such assurance

514
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,880
 knowing that on the other end was the fire?

515
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,320
 How did they do it?

516
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,520
 Because they had faith.

517
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,320
 Hebrews chapter 11 defines faith like this.

518
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,760
 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for

519
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,920
 and assurance about what we do not see.

520
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,360
 They could not see if God would save them from the fire,

521
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,320
 but it did not matter because they were assured

522
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,820
 that God would be with them.

523
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,520
 Whether it was the fire, whether it was on land

524
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,500
 or whether it was in heaven, God would not leave them

525
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,560
 because they know that he would never leave them

526
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,400
 or forsake us.

527
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,560
 That's not who he is.

528
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,020
 He is always present.

529
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,020
 So because of that, they were able to stand and be different

530
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,680
 although everyone else bowed.

531
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,880
 How were they so assured?

532
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,520
 Because they had the right informing of their faith,

533
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,320
 which leads me to point two.

534
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,640
 A faith that's on fire must be rightly informed.

535
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
 Verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied,

536
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,680
 you know, he says, is it true that you won't bow?

537
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,040
 I'm gonna give you one more chance

538
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,600
 or I'm throwing you in the fire to be burned alive.

539
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,200
 And here's what they say.

540
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,080
 I mean, this is crazy when you think about it.

541
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,140
 The face of death, here's what they say.

542
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,920
 It's almost as if they're laughing.

543
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,760
 They're so at peace.

544
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,560
 Oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need

545
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,940
 to defend ourselves before you.

546
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,640
 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace,

547
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,600
 the God whom we serve is able to save us.

548
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,640
 Notice that they said that he is able, not that he will.

549
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,480
 He's able.

550
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,640
 That was enough for them.

551
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,400
 He will rescue us from your power, your majesty,

552
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,120
 but even if he doesn't, but even if he doesn't,

553
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,760
 but even if he doesn't, we want to make it clear to you,

554
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 your majesty, that we will never serve your gods

555
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,980
 or worship the gold statue you have set up.

556
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,820
 What we see here is that these men's faith

557
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,980
 was rightly informed by what?

558
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,720
 God's word and God's character.

559
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,060
 God's sufficient word and God's never changing character.

560
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,900
 How do we see that?

561
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,720
 Look at their response.

562
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,200
 Response number one, they say, oh, Nebuchadnezzar,

563
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,520
 we do not need to defend ourselves before you.

564
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,620
 What does that say that they know

565
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,000
 about the character of God?

566
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,440
 They're saying we don't need to defend ourselves

567
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,500
 because our God is a defender.

568
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,680
 Response number two, if we are thrown

569
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,960
 into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve

570
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,200
 is able to save us.

571
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,800
 He will rescue us from your power.

572
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,640
 They're saying, hey, the saving isn't on us.

573
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,800
 We don't have to save ourselves

574
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,440
 because our God is a rescuer.

575
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,760
 It's a part of his character.

576
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,000
 He defends and he rescues the oppressed.

577
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,160
 Response number three, but even if he doesn't,

578
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,160
 I think that part is really challenging for us today,

579
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,280
 especially in America.

580
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,480
 We have created a comfortable Christianity

581
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,620
 that doesn't want to say this line.

582
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,260
 But even if he doesn't, we wanna make it clear to you

583
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,040
 that we will never serve your gods

584
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,160
 or worship the gold statue you have set up.

585
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,940
 What they're saying with that response is

586
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,640
 we will be obedient to our God, the God,

587
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
 despite the outcome.

588
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
 Why?

589
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,800
 Because they knew that our God is the ultimate king.

590
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,120
 You might be king on earth, but we serve a higher king,

591
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,840
 the king of majesty, the alpha and the omega,

592
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,280
 the beginning and the end.

593
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,720
 His name is God almighty, and that's who we serve.

594
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
 So even if he doesn't give us our desired outcome

595
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,240
 of staying alive, we will never bow down.

596
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,480
 So you might as well put us in the fire.

597
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,380
 Their response informed what they believed.

598
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,300
 That's what we know what they believe

599
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,700
 by the way they responded,

600
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,540
 because God's word and God's character

601
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,260
 is what informed their faith.

602
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,840
 The reason why we know this at this time,

603
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,620
 we don't know how many books of the Old Testament

604
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,180
 these guys had to study and know.

605
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,260
 We know they had the first five books of the Bible.

606
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,380
 And by these responses, what I'm seeing them say is,

607
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,180
 hey, we know that the God who fulfilled his promise

608
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,480
 to Abraham, the father of Israel, is the same God today.

609
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,680
 We know the God who took Israel out of Egypt

610
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,440
 through 10 miraculous plagues and split the Red Sea

611
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,800
 for our people to walk through is the same God today.

612
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,960
 We know that God is faithful, that he breaks down the walls,

613
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,720
 that he wins wars, that he makes ways.

614
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,460
 That's who our God is.

615
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,280
 And because of that, because we've read it and we believe it

616
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,960
 and because that God is the same God today,

617
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,840
 we will never bow.

618
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,160
 And the same God who was the God of Israel

619
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,920
 whenever they were in slavery to Egypt,

620
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,160
 the God of Israel when they were enslaved

621
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,840
 to the Babylonian empire is the same God today for you.

622
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
 When you are underneath the impression

623
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,900
 of the darkness of this world, of culture,

624
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,320
 of people who are telling you

625
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,880
 that you have to go this way or else,

626
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,920
 you have to know what informs my faith is God's word

627
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,320
 and God's never-changing character.

628
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,600
 I think a lot of us, when we get to these moments

629
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,520
 of defining moments in our life,

630
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,840
 the reason why we crumble is because sadly,

631
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,160
 we don't know God's character

632
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,800
 because we don't know God's word.

633
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,360
 We know a quote on Instagram.

634
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,600
 We know a pastor's one-minute clip.

635
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,480
 We know little bits of sermons that are fed to us.

636
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
 We remember the one sentence that we wrote down,

637
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,700
 but these guys clearly had spent time knowing God's word,

638
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,440
 therefore, they had a very real view of his character

639
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,600
 and that's what dictated their right response

640
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,780
 to these defining moments 'cause their faith was informed

641
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,080
 by something that doesn't change.

642
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,560
 But today, so many people's faith is informed

643
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,700
 by their feelings, by their emotions,

644
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,320
 by their experiences, by their opinions,

645
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,600
 and those things, those things are the improper way.

646
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,800
 They are the wrong way to inform your faith.

647
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
 Why?

648
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
 All of those things change.

649
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,600
 Your feelings, you're like Nebuchadnezzar, all right?

650
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,240
 You're hot, then you're cold, yes, then you're no,

651
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,880
 and then you're out, up, then you're down, all the things.

652
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,000
 Feelings make terrible gods.

653
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,160
 Emotions, yeah, they're real, they're there,

654
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,000
 but they are not what dictate your faith.

655
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,880
 Experiences, so many of you have experienced,

656
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,180
 the reason why you come to the porch,

657
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,520
 but you're out on church and you're like,

658
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,400
 I don't need to go to church to be a Christian,

659
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,540
 is because you've let one experience,

660
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,760
 one experience of church hurt, which hello,

661
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,260
 the reason why that church hurt exists

662
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,800
 because you're a broken person

663
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,200
 interacting with broken people,

664
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,080
 therefore, that is what causes oftentimes dysfunction,

665
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,720
 you let that experience inform your faith,

666
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,560
 and so now you're out on church

667
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,600
 because an experience guides your life.

668
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,020
 We need to stop projecting our experiences onto God.

669
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,760
 Because your dad left you

670
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,680
 does not mean that your God will leave you.

671
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,000
 Because that person cheated on you and left you

672
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,980
 does not mean that God will forsake you.

673
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,480
 God is not that experience, God is not that person,

674
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,800
 he is the only thing that is available

675
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,120
 and fully capable of informing your faith

676
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,700
 because he's the only thing that never changes.

677
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,520
 That's why his word and his never changing character

678
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,640
 are the right ways to inform your faith,

679
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,720
 these guys clearly understood that.

680
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,960
 Second Timothy 3.16 says that all scripture,

681
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,340
 all scripture is breathed out by God,

682
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,680
 that everything you read the Bible

683
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,440
 is inspired and breathed out by God,

684
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,080
 and it can be used for teaching, for correcting,

685
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,740
 and for training in all righteousness.

686
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,120
 That means that it is complete,

687
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,640
 the Bible says it's complete and lacking nothing.

688
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
 You don't need to add anything to it,

689
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,120
 you don't need to take away anything from it.

690
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,280
 But the reason why we do,

691
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,400
 the reason why we would like ourselves

692
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,520
 to be gods of our life,

693
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,960
 the reason why we want our feelings and our experiences

694
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,280
 to inform our faith is because we get to decide

695
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,160
 when we are in and out with God,

696
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,920
 and we get to decide when we wanna pick

697
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,800
 what parts of the Bible that we wanna follow.

698
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,840
 Because if my feelings and how I feel today

699
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,960
 get to determine how I respond to God,

700
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,080
 that's much more easier and comfortable

701
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,520
 than relying on what he says is best for me.

702
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,340
 So if I wake up today

703
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,520
 and I feel like walking rightly with God, then I will,

704
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,720
 but if I feel lonely and sad,

705
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,680
 then yeah, I'll go hook up with that person

706
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,760
 because my feelings inform my faith.

707
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,800
 Those things are the wrong way to inform,

708
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,160
 the right way to inform your faith.

709
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,520
 If you're gonna have a faith on fire,

710
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,400
 it must be rightly informed.

711
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,280
 You inform it with God's sufficient word

712
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,060
 and his never-changing character.

713
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,920
 The last thing to have a faith on fire that you need,

714
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,200
 a faith on fire produces action.

715
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,040
 We see in this story that a faith on fire produces action.

716
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,880
 Look at this.

717
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,640
 They go through all this stuff, they say all these things,

718
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,920
 and then in verse 21,

719
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,880
 they tied them up and they threw them into the furnace,

720
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,080
 fully dressed in their pants, turbans,

721
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,480
 robes, and other garments,

722
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,560
 and because the king in his anger

723
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,480
 had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace,

724
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,760
 the flames killed the soldiers

725
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,960
 as they threw the three men in.

726
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,000
 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied,

727
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,360
 fell into the roaring flames.

728
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,840
 Their faith was not just talk.

729
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,040
 Talk is cheap.

730
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,300
 They were men of action.

731
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,160
 We always say actions speak louder than words.

732
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,560
 Here are the kind of actions in these men.

733
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,640
 These men are displaying the kind of action

734
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,080
 that follows real faith.

735
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,720
 Here are the kind of actions that follow a false faith,

736
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,280
 a fake faith.

737
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,160
 God, I trust you with my life.

738
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,400
 Guy walks by.

739
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,160
 I'm kind of tired of singleness, you know.

740
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,600
 God's kind of taking a long time.

741
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,040
 He doesn't go to the church.

742
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,840
 He doesn't read his Bible.

743
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,800
 Calls himself a Christian, good stable career.

744
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,040
 He's enough for me.

745
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,320
 Walks over here.

746
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,040
 But you just said in faith,

747
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,880
 God, I trust you with my life.

748
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,280
 And then when something walks by

749
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,040
 that clearly isn't God's best

750
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,680
 and your actions take you over here,

751
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,040
 something's off.

752
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,680
 Real faith are followed by actions.

753
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,280
 What you do points to what you actually believe.

754
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,960
 And so that action tells me,

755
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,760
 no, God, I don't trust you.

756
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,040
 You're taking too long.

757
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,480
 All my roommates are married with two kids.

758
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,000
 So I'm taking matter into my own hands.

759
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,920
 You can be God when I need blessings,

760
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,040
 but I'm gonna be God when I get what I want,

761
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,480
 when I wanna get what I want.

762
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,600
 Another example, God, I wanna go all in with you.

763
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,360
 We come to the porch and we're like,

764
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,500
 hey guys, God would call you to be a part of a local body,

765
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,240
 to serve the church, to serve the needs of the city,

766
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,560
 to be in community, to read his word.

767
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,400
 And you're like, what?

768
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,760
 Sundays are Miami days.

769
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,880
 Self-care.

770
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,040
 Like I'm so busy Monday through Friday,

771
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,560
 and then I go out for different things on Saturday.

772
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,940
 I get the pump in on Sunday.

773
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,080
 Like I just don't got time for that.

774
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,320
 I'll stream at home.

775
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,480
 But you just said, God, I wanna be all in.

776
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,360
 God, I want to be intimate with you.

777
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,320
 God, I want a thriving relationship with you.

778
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,660
 I wanna be Christ-like, yet you don't have time.

779
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,140
 Your actions point to what you believe.

780
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,700
 God, I want to stop partying.

781
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,040
 I just, I don't know how it happens.

782
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,100
 I keep hooking up with people.

783
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,020
 I wanna stop.

784
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,900
 You going out tonight?

785
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,300
 Yeah, meet you there at six.

786
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:53,220
 I'm like, and here's the issue.

787
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,080
 When you're feeling like the next morning,

788
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,060
 like guilt after sex, when you're feeling that,

789
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,760
 you're like, God, I wanna be done.

790
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,120
 And then the lonely hours come the next Saturday.

791
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,320
 And you're sitting there, you get the text.

792
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,600
 Hey, you wanna go out tonight?

793
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,520
 And you're like, I know I shouldn't.

794
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,920
 I know I shouldn't.

795
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,040
 That's gonna lead to me drinking too much.

796
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,960
 That's gonna lead me to getting some liquid courage.

797
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,840
 That's gonna lead me to Snapchatting that person

798
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
 and ending up at their house at 3 a.m.

799
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,520
 And I'm gonna just get into this vicious cycle.

800
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,040
 And I look at your actions.

801
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,560
 And if actions point to what you believe,

802
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,360
 what does that say about your faith?

803
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,340
 Do you have faith that God

804
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,480
 will fully satisfy your every need?

805
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,520
 That God knows that you need before you even ask,

806
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,220
 so you don't have to go searching?

807
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,960
 James 2:17 says, "So also faith by itself,

808
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,600
 "if it does not have works, is dead."

809
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,020
 Faith by itself, if it does not have action, is dead faith.

810
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,320
 Fake faith.

811
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,880
 And I think I know what the problem is.

812
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,160
 Like, there are a lot of motivational speeches out there

813
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,160
 that encourage people like to have fiery faith.

814
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,000
 And yeah, I wanna be marked by courageous decisions.

815
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
 And I wanna go all in with God.

816
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,780
 And I want fiery faith.

817
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,080
 You want it until it actually calls you into the fire.

818
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,520
 You wanna be known as someone with a fiery faith

819
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,080
 until it's time to step up.

820
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,720
 And it's really easy to proclaim it

821
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,320
 on the outside of the furnace looking in

822
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,080
 until you start getting tied up.

823
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,720
 I mean, these guys did it all right, right?

824
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,660
 They were like, "We're not gonna bow."

825
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,640
 They didn't bow.

826
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
 "Our God will save us.

827
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,600
 "Our God will save us.

828
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,500
 "Our God will save us, right God?"

829
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,920
 Tied the knot, tied the knot.

830
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,040
 Like, "God, our God will save us."

831
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,760
 And they start to swing them.

832
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,560
 And they're like, "Really, God?"

833
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,260
 And they started throwing them in like a stack of logs.

834
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:51,280
 So many of us claim to want a faith on fire

835
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,520
 until it calls us to put some money where our mouth is,

836
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,360
 until action.

837
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,520
 We would rather have the perks of Christianity,

838
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,960
 but not the persecution that comes with it.

839
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
 We want salvation, but without suffering.

840
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,240
 We want amazing grace,

841
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,720
 but just enough to cover up our guilt,

842
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,940
 not to actually change our lives.

843
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,760
 We want to be sons and daughters of God,

844
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,920
 but still cousins with the world.

845
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,240
 We want to be known as people of radical faith

846
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,680
 until it calls us out into radical obedience,

847
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,560
 until it calls us into the fire.

848
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,980
 But I'm telling you, if you want real faith,

849
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,240
 then you're gonna get some heat.

850
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,400
 You're gonna get some pressure from the world.

851
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,720
 And faith is followed by action.

852
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,240
 And so I'm asking you,

853
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,940
 what do your actions say about your faith?

854
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,240
 If what you do points to what you believe,

855
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,140
 how are you doing?

856
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:47,080
 Me and my wife, we, since being married,

857
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,140
 girls have the craziest fears.

858
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,440
 It's crazy.

859
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,460
 And I started noticing, she came from Arkansas,

860
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,400
 and she's in Texas, and she wasn't driving on the highways.

861
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,800
 And she told me, by the way, I'm afraid of Dallas highways,

862
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,240
 so I'm not gonna drive on them.

863
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,160
 And so now sometimes she tries to be sweet,

864
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,480
 and she's like, "Can we like, want me to drive?"

865
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,560
 And I'm like, "Heck no, girl.

866
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,860
 "A 20-minute trip takes 50 minutes with you,

867
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,280
 "running all these back roads."

868
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,040
 And so what I'll do is I'll acknowledge the fear,

869
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
 and she loves this, let me tell you.

870
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,680
 I'll acknowledge the fear,

871
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,560
 and I'll try to get to the root of it.

872
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,560
 Because I'm like, "Wait, this is not okay.

873
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,840
 "You are my wife, you can drive on a highway, all right?"

874
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,640
 And so I'll say, "Hey, why are you afraid

875
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,440
 "to drive on highways?"

876
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,920
 And she'll go, "Because there's a lot of cars going fast."

877
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,680
 Today, actually, she threw me a new one.

878
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
 She said, "Because what if I faint?"

879
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,880
 I'm like.

880
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,480
 (congregation laughing)

881
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,160
 Like, am I married to a fainting girl?

882
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,000
 Like, what's going on?

883
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 What if I faint?

884
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
 People just fainting now?

885
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
 She's like, "What if I faint?"

886
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,880
 I'm like, "All right, okay, so what if you faint?"

887
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,680
 And she's like, "Well, then I'll get in a wreck."

888
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,880
 And I'm like, "Okay, well, what if you get in a wreck?"

889
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,780
 And she's like, "Well, then it'll hurt."

890
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,920
 And I'm like, "Okay, well, what if it hurts?"

891
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,900
 And she's like, "Well, then I'll go to the hospital."

892
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,880
 I'm like, "Well, what if you go to the hospital?"

893
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,360
 She's like, "I'll either get saved, I'll either heal."

894
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,200
 I was like, "Or?"

895
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,360
 And she'll go, "Or I'll die."

896
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,080
 And I'm like, "Okay, okay.

897
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,040
 "What if you die?"

898
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,960
 And she kind of smiles every time.

899
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,280
 'Cause it always ends to death.

900
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,520
 That's the root fear, death.

901
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,600
 (congregation laughing)

902
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,960
 I'm like, "So what if you die?"

903
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
 And she smiles and she goes, "I'll be in heaven."

904
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,120
 (congregation laughing)

905
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,960
 That's silly, but y'all, that is powerful, all right?

906
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,360
 Because the problem with us today,

907
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,240
 the problem with me today,

908
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,600
 is there's something in me that doesn't actually believe

909
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,520
 that heaven is better than earth.

910
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,080
 There's something in me that when I look at my actions,

911
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,320
 I'm living as if earth is the end goal.

912
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,320
 I'm looking like conformity and having people like me

913
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,720
 is where the treasure is found.

914
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,520
 I'm looking like success and more money

915
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,200
 and more opportunities, that's where satisfaction lies.

916
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,320
 That shows me that I think heaven is it,

917
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,240
 or I think earth is it.

918
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,560
 But I need to tell myself,

919
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,640
 you need to tell yourself in these moments of opportunity

920
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,080
 where you need to choose fear or faith,

921
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,280
 when heaven is the reward, suffering is the gain.

922
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,520
 Testing is the opportunity.

923
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,160
 When the world is bowing, standing up for what's right,

924
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,080
 even though it might result in suffering,

925
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,240
 you have to see that as the advantage.

926
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,680
 Because like Paul says,

927
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,400
 it's when we're weak that he's made strong.

928
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,400
 His power is made perfect through our weakness.

929
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,880
 These guys were thrown into a fire, thrown into a fire.

930
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,440
 And now this was the opportunity

931
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,640
 where God got to flex his power.

932
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,480
 And he wants to do the same with you.

933
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,440
 But you have to go, man, when I am freaking out,

934
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,680
 when the rest of the world is bowing down,

935
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,640
 when the rest of the world is doing this, I will not bow.

936
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,040
 I am not afraid of what lies on the other end

937
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,840
 of not compromising and bowing down.

938
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,720
 I'm not afraid, even if it leads to death,

939
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,620
 even if it leads to death, being with God is greater.

940
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,960
 I have to tell myself all that all the time.

941
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,240
 Being with God is greater.

942
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,040
 And these men, they clearly understood.

943
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,660
 They clearly had a right perspective

944
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,120
 of what it looks like to be marked by faith

945
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,500
 and where faith could lead them.

946
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,660
 And they were willing to say,

947
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,280
 but even if he doesn't save us,

948
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,800
 to be with our King is greater than being here.

949
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,780
 And once they were thrown into the fire,

950
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,080
 that's when God showed up.

951
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,980
 Verse 24, "But suddenly Nebuchadnezzar jumped in amazement

952
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,360
 "and exclaimed to his advisors,

953
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,280
 "didn't we tie up three men

954
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,860
 "and throw them into the furnace?

955
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,400
 "Yes, we certainly did.

956
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,700
 "Look, he shouted, I see four men

957
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,100
 "unbound walking around in the fire unharmed.

958
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,940
 "And the fourth looks like a God.

959
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,320
 "The fourth looks like a God.

960
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,020
 "And then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could

961
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,740
 "to the door of the flaming furnace.

962
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,860
 "And he shouted, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

963
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,800
 "servants of the most high God, come out, come here.

964
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,220
 "So they got out and they stepped out of the fire.

965
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,260
 "And then all the people gathered around

966
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,560
 "and they saw that the fire had not even touched them.

967
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,200
 "They didn't even smell like smoke.

968
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,920
 "And he said, praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach,

969
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,840
 "and Abednego.

970
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,240
 "He sent his angel to rescue his servants,

971
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,300
 "just like they said he would, who trusted in him.

972
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,680
 "They defiled the king's commands.

973
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,800
 "They defied the king's command and were willing to die

974
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,940
 "rather than serve or worship any God

975
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,800
 "except their own God."

976
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,280
 The point of having great faith

977
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,320
 is to not make your name more great.

978
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,560
 The point of having great faith

979
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,280
 is to point to the victory of your great God.

980
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,360
 That's why he calls us to have radical faith.

981
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,200
 That's why he calls us to step out into the unknown

982
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,640
 so that way when you choose to surrender

983
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,160
 in radical obedience despite outcomes,

984
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,720
 that's when he can put his glory on display through you

985
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,640
 to the hurting and lost world.

986
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,040
 And if you will choose,

987
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,460
 if you will choose to let your suffering define your God,

988
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,440
 if you will let yourself choose

989
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,200
 to let your God define your suffering

990
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,800
 and not your suffering to define your God,

991
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,160
 watch what he'll do.

992
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,000
 Watch what he'll do with that obedience.

993
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,160
 He will take that moment

994
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,080
 and he will use it to display his goodness

995
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,120
 and his power and his glory to the world through you.

996
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,160
 Just like he did through these guys.

997
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,240
 Notice, they didn't have to say anything profound.

998
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,680
 They didn't have to say anything to change their mind.

999
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,120
 They just simply had to live it out.

1000
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,800
 Their faith had action.

1001
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,240
 And when they put that action into practice,

1002
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,240
 that's when the king said, "Wow, look at this God.

1003
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,340
 "Look at this God.

1004
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,040
 "He is the only God worthy of worship.

1005
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,080
 "And if you, if you, when compromise

1006
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,740
 "and those opportunities come,

1007
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,880
 "will stand up and be different,

1008
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,020
 "if you will inform your faith correctly,

1009
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:15,200
 "and if you will let your faith lead you to great action,

1010
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,260
 "to point to your great God, watch what he will do."

1011
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,020
 Watch what he will do.

1012
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,080
 I don't know what your fire is.

1013
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,020
 I don't know what your even if moment is,

1014
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,880
 that even if God doesn't give a desired outcome,

1015
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,720
 I'm gonna trust him.

1016
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,840
 I don't know what that moment is.

1017
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,240
 But what I do know is that if you choose to respond

1018
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,680
 with real radical faith, watch what God will do.

1019
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,400
 He will do the unthinkable.

1020
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,440
 He will do exceedingly more than you could ever ask or think.

1021
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,080
 He's just waiting for you to say yes.

1022
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,880
 He's waiting for you to have real faith in him.

1023
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,720
 Let's pray.

1024
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,840
 God, I thank you that it's not because of our faith,

1025
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,520
 it's not because of our decision,

1026
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,280
 it's not because of our works that we are saved,

1027
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,920
 but it's because you, God, sent your son down to earth

1028
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,260
 to pay the ultimate price,

1029
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:18,000
 because your son stepped into the fire of this world

1030
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,160
 in sin and shame and brokenness,

1031
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,600
 and defeated it by rising from the grave three days later.

1032
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,440
 Because of that, we now can walk towards trials,

1033
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,400
 we can walk towards persecution and suffering.

1034
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,460
 We now can stand up when the rest of the world

1035
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,480
 is bowing down.

1036
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,600
 We can look different because of what you have done for us.

1037
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,100
 And I pray that these people, that this generation,

1038
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,040
 would see that the world is hurting

1039
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,800
 and looking for something real, someone different,

1040
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,640
 and may it start with the radical decisions in this room.

1041
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,960
 I pray that me, my friends here tonight,

1042
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,160
 that we'd be marked by people of real faith

1043
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,600
 because you are a real God who wants to do real things

1044
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,160
 through his people when they say yes to you.

1045
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,640
 Would we respond right now with whatever it is

1046
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,860
 that even if, even if you don't heal the cancer,

1047
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,980
 even if you don't change things around,

1048
