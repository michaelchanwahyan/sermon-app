00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,520
 All right, Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,020
 Let's go.

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,520
 Let me hear it from you.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,120
 Hey, it's great to be here together.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,040
 You know, I don't know what else you could have

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,540
 had planned for this evening, but I

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,400
 know that you making the choice to be with us here

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,240
 is quite the honor.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,640
 So thanks so much for choosing to be here with us

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
 this evening.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,540
 Not only those of you here in the room, which you look great,

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,200
 you know, glad to have you, but also all of you

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,040
 tuning in from all over the nation.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
 Like, it's so amazing that God's doing something

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,500
 significant here in Dallas, but he's

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,240
 doing something significant all over the nation.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,800
 And so we're grateful that you would choose to trust us

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,520
 with your time.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,360
 Special shout out to Porch's live Fresno, Fort Worth, Tulsa.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,160
 We love that y'all are tuning in, as always.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,160
 Well, Porch, we have been in a series in the book of Colossians

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,800
 and tonight we come to the fateful end.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,520
 I know, that's how I feel.

25
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,360
 But before we get there, I'll start off with a story.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,240
 I've shared this before, but I remember

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,240
 when I was 16 years old, making my way out

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,900
 from schools into the day and going to the pickup line.

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,960
 My dad was there and as always, he

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,000
 was sitting in the circle drive ready to pick me up and take me

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,500
 home.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,660
 And so I make my way out.

33
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,660
 I see him sitting where he's always sitting.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,720
 I throw open the door.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,740
 I toss my bag into the backseat.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,740
 I begin to climb up into the car.

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,580
 I sit down.

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,000
 I buckle myself in.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,820
 And he looks at me.

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,140
 He's like, bro, what are you doing?

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,340
 Well, he didn't say bro, because that's not

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,300
 how dads talk to sons.

43
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,480
 But he said, what are you doing?

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,000
 Is it obvious?

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,620
 Please don't make me go back in there.

46
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,320
 Like it's the end of the school day.

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
 We're going home.

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
 I worked all day.

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
 It's time to get out of here.

50
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
 Fired up, brother.

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,280
 Like, let's get out.

52
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,000
 You're not going home with me.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,160
 What are you talking about?

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,880
 Of course we are.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,160
 We do this every single day.

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,560
 Like I get in the car, throw my bag in the back,

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,040
 buckle myself in, we drive home.

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,520
 What do you mean we're not going home together?

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,480
 You're not driving home with me today.

60
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,340
 And then he proceeded to toss me my own set of car keys.

61
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,300
 Yes, you can imagine my enthusiasm.

62
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,020
 I had been working year after year,

63
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,900
 mowing grass, saving up that hard earned money

64
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,980
 to pay for my portion of the vehicle.

65
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,300
 And so he throws me the keys.

66
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,060
 And he says, it's your son.

67
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,220
 Well, where is it?

68
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,580
 That's the catch.

69
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,460
 You've got to find it.

70
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,060
 What does that mean?

71
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,460
 It's in the parking lot.

72
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,900
 So I have no idea what this truck looks like,

73
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,380
 where he has it parked.

74
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,860
 So what do you think my response is in this moment?

75
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,580
 Like, are you serious?

76
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,180
 Like, no.

77
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,220
 I was enthused.

78
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,540
 I was like, man, like, where's that?

79
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,180
 Let me get out of here.

80
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,720
 And so I hopped out of the truck and I

81
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,300
 ran full on sprint into the parking lot.

82
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,500
 And I'm up and down the aisles and I'm clicking that clicker

83
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 as fast as possible because I want to find my truck.

84
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,140
 Like, this is huge for me.

85
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,220
 Like, this is the secret.

86
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,900
 The passage into a whole new way of living.

87
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,360
 Like, this is going to give me a freedom the likes of which

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,660
 I've never known before.

89
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,340
 And so I'm moving up and down the aisles.

90
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,500
 I'm looking everywhere I can.

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,660
 I'm searching high and low.

92
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,980
 And wouldn't you believe it?

93
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,660
 I finally find it at the very back of the parking lot,

94
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,660
 looking fresh and clean and ready for our departure.

95
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,860
 How crazy would it have been if I unlocked that truck,

96
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,780
 I hopped up into the cab, I started tuning the stereo,

97
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,420
 reading the manual cover to cover, I hopped out

98
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,740
 of the truck and I started inspecting all the contours

99
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,540
 and lines of its body.

100
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,340
 Like, what would it--

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,500
 how crazy would it have been if I spent all that time

102
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 learning as much about that truck as possible

103
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,180
 and yet I never drove it off the lot?

104
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:12,300
 How crazy would that be?

105
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,700
 It wouldn't make any sense.

106
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,200
 Why?

107
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,180
 Because that truck, it's meant for more.

108
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,900
 Like, it's not meant to stay where it is.

109
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,340
 It's meant for action.

110
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,100
 It's supposed to get out onto the road.

111
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,940
 It's supposed to lead me into the sunset

112
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,460
 and into a broader future.

113
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,700
 So let me ask you this, Porch.

114
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,940
 How crazy is it for us to receive the keys

115
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,220
 to a whole new way of life in Christ

116
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,060
 yet never take action on that life either?

117
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,720
 How crazy would that be?

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,260
 You see, we've been journeying through the book of Colossians

119
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,020
 and we've learned a lot up to this point.

120
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,180
 It's been weeks up until this time.

121
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,220
 And what we've been studying as we've made our way

122
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,300
 is we've learned the message of the gospel and the majesty

123
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,300
 of Christ's supremacy and the mysteries of his sufficiency

124
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,140
 and the myriad of threats we face along the way

125
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,300
 and the markings of genuine belief.

126
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,220
 We've learned so much.

127
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,940
 And yet as we come to the final page tonight,

128
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,220
 chapter 4 of the book, which if you have the Bible,

129
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,520
 you can turn there with me now.

130
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,060
 As we turn to the very end of this letter

131
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,980
 from the apostle Paul, which he's been telling us

132
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,660
 is all about, man, if you want maturity in life,

133
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,020
 then you need clarity of Christ.

134
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,220
 As we move to the final page,

135
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,440
 he tells us clarity doesn't just lead to your maturity,

136
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,960
 it also leads to a whole new activity.

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,220
 It changes the way you move through the world.

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,700
 That as we behold Jesus, yes, as Paul's repeatedly unpacked,

139
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,340
 yes, as you behold him, you do become like him,

140
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,020
 but not only that, you begin to believe like him,

141
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,860
 which is what?

142
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,860
 That there's a mission, that there's not just a message

143
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,980
 and a mystery and a majesty and a myriad of threats.

144
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,100
 No, there's a mission that we're supposed to be a part of,

145
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,120
 that God, he is saving the world,

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,900
 that he's rescuing people, that he's overcoming evil,

147
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,460
 that he's given purposes for us to fulfill,

148
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,820
 that this is what Jesus believed.

149
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,900
 And he fulfilled the mission

150
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,060
 and then handed us our marching orders.

151
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,760
 And he said, now you go and do it too.

152
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,220
 Like we have a part to play.

153
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,540
 And so what Paul wants to talk to us about tonight

154
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,620
 is how do we play that part?

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,460
 What does it look like for us to take everything

156
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,460
 we've learned and now live it in the real world?

157
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,900
 That's what he's taking us to.

158
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,020
 How is it that we joined the mission of Jesus Christ

159
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,500
 to save the world?

160
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,660
 He's gonna give us some steps.

161
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,620
 The first of which we find in verse two

162
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,980
 of Colossians chapter four, which says this,

163
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,300
 continue steadfastly in prayer,

164
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,580
 being watchful in it with thanksgiving.

165
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,260
 You see the first step that Paul is gonna teach us tonight

166
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,140
 is that we should pray with devotion.

167
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,740
 We should pray with devotion,

168
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,780
 which may feel a little anticlimactic to you.

169
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,240
 So you're telling me that's it?

170
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,700
 Like we have appeared into the mysteries of the gospel.

171
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,860
 We have postulated on the majesties of God.

172
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,980
 We have pointed out all the spiritual frauds of our day.

173
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,060
 And that's the takeaway.

174
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,340
 Like that's what you're telling me.

175
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,700
 Just pray about it a little bit.

176
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,780
 That's what you want me to walk away tonight with.

177
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,180
 Thank you so much for wasting the last nine weeks

178
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,020
 of my life.

179
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,200
 Here's the thing that you need to understand.

180
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,780
 Paul has a very different understanding of prayer

181
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,180
 than we so often do.

182
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,100
 You see, he sees something in prayer

183
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,160
 that we too frequently forget, which is this.

184
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,060
 That prayer is powerful.

185
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,000
 That it's powerful.

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,400
 Some of you are like,

187
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,020
 "Man, I could have forecasted you were gonna say that."

188
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,280
 But here's the thing.

189
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,960
 Like don't tune out yet because I want you to catch the fact

190
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,840
 that this is such a momentous part

191
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,520
 of not just this chapter, but this book.

192
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,880
 Because you see the disciples, the followers of Jesus,

193
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,840
 they come to him in Luke chapter 11,

194
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
 and they look at him and they say,

195
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,840
 "Jesus, would you teach us how to pray?"

196
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,800
 That's what they ask him.

197
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,200
 And it's the only instance in the entire Bible,

198
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,960
 specifically within the gospel accounts,

199
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,100
 where his disciples come to him and say,

200
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,120
 "Hey, will you teach us this exactly?"

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,840
 What would you have asked Jesus to teach you?

202
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
 How to walk on water?

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,040
 How to perform some miracles?

204
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,960
 How to debate your opponents?

205
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
 How to make a public speech?

206
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,800
 Like what would you have asked?

207
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,320
 Like what would you have had him teach you?

208
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,040
 They could have asked him anything.

209
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,680
 Like this is the son of God.

210
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,800
 Like this is deity in flesh.

211
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,640
 And they look at him and they say,

212
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,920
 "Would you teach us how to pray?"

213
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,760
 Why?

214
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,400
 Why do they ask that?

215
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,760
 Because they'd seen him pray.

216
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,560
 And they'd seen the difference it made.

217
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
 You see, as they saw Jesus,

218
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,080
 what they saw was a man that looked unlike

219
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,680
 any other man they'd ever known.

220
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,800
 The gospel writers, they're emphatic about this.

221
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,880
 Matthew 7 tells us,

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,080
 "And when Jesus finished these sayings,

223
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,160
 the crowds were astonished at his teachings,

224
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,760
 for he was teaching them as one who had authority

225
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
 and not as their scribes.

226
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,720
 He stood out."

227
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,080
 John 6, it tells us,

228
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,480
 "Simon Peter answered him,

229
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,560
 'Lord, to whom shall we go?

230
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,600
 You and you alone have the words of eternal life.'"

231
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,560
 And we've believed, we've come to know,

232
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,240
 you're the Holy One of God, not someone else.

233
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
 You are, you're the Holy One of God.

234
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,280
 You have the words of eternal life.

235
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,960
 Where else would we go?

236
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,800
 Mark 4 tells us,

237
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,240
 "And they were filled with great fear.

238
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
 And they said to one another,

239
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,120
 'Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?'"

240
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,960
 Later in Mark, it says,

241
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,880
 "And when the centurion who stood facing him upon the cross

242
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,800
 saw the way that he breathed his last, he said,

243
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,640
 'Truly, this man was the son of God.'"

244
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,800
 Because mortal men do not die like that.

245
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,440
 They do not die with their life in their own hand.

246
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,880
 There's no one like him.

247
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,320
 Like Jesus spoke and moved and taught and served

248
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,480
 and loved in a way,

249
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,680
 the likes of which we have never before seen.

250
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,480
 And I would argue it is largely, not entirely,

251
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
 but largely due to the fact

252
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,800
 that he pulled from the power of his prayer life.

253
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,040
 That he pulled from the power of his prayer life.

254
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,160
 Like all throughout the gospels,

255
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,680
 if you just trace the miracle-making moments

256
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,840
 of his ministry,

257
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,680
 what you'll find is on the front side or on the backside,

258
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,480
 either preceding or proceeding,

259
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,520
 those moments is a moment of prayer.

260
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,640
 You see, Jesus rhythmically retreated to be with God.

261
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,800
 So he rhythmically repeated the works of God.

262
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 He would retreat to be with him.

263
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,200
 And because of it, he would repeat the works of God.

264
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,880
 And here's what's crazy.

265
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,000
 You listening, porch?

266
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,120
 Paul's telling us how we can tap into the same source,

267
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,840
 how we can access the same power.

268
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,880
 Jesus says it in John chapter 14.

269
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,640
 He says, "Truly, truly, I say to you

270
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,440
 that whoever believes in me

271
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,880
 will also do the works that I do."

272
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,080
 Like everything he did, hello, it's available for you.

273
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,520
 Like you can do it, but not just that, keep listening.

274
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,640
 "And greater works than these will she do

275
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,520
 because I am going to the Father."

276
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,720
 Where's Jesus right now?

277
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
 He's not here.

278
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
 He's with the Father,

279
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,960
 which means greater works are available to you and I.

280
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,920
 How do we access it?

281
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,680
 "Whatever you ask in my name,

282
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,840
 whatever you pray,

283
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,040
 this I will do that the Father may be glorified in the Son."

284
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,680
 Which sounds pretty incredible, right?

285
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,240
 Like, do you want some of that in your world?

286
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,480
 Like, I would take some of that.

287
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,320
 That's why Paul tells us,

288
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,120
 "Hey, then continue steadfastly in prayer.

289
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,680
 Be watchful in it with thanksgiving."

290
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,520
 He says that we should be steadfast.

291
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,480
 As we pray, we should be focused.

292
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,440
 We should be devoted.

293
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,680
 If you look at the original language,

294
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,200
 what it's saying there is that we should be singularly,

295
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,960
 undividedly committed to one pursuit.

296
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,760
 Another translation says that we should be devoted to prayer.

297
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,940
 So think about something that you were recently devoted to.

298
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,560
 Training for a marathon,

299
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
 saving up to buy a house,

300
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
 working to pay off debt,

301
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
 trying to get that guy or that girl's attention.

302
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
 You know, like what,

303
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,720
 I don't know what it is that you were devoted to

304
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,000
 here recently,

305
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,900
 but what was true of your devotion?

306
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,120
 The degree of your devotion

307
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,240
 informed the degree of your decisions.

308
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,640
 Like if you wanted that,

309
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,040
 then you would do whatever it took to get there.

310
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,280
 I love Abraham Lincoln.

311
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,620
 He says that discipline is choosing what we want most

312
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,140
 over what we want now.

313
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,620
 That's devotion.

314
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,620
 It's I'm willing to do discipline to get what I want most.

315
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,140
 Even if it means I have to forgo some things

316
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,280
 that I want right now.

317
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,660
 That's how Paul is saying we should pray.

318
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,580
 He's saying we should pray with that kind of devotion,

319
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,420
 with that kind of intensity,

320
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,300
 with that kind of urgency.

321
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,100
 You know, like that's what he's articulating.

322
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,000
 But here's the reality, Porch.

323
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,780
 Many of us, we can't give prayer that kind of devotion

324
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,380
 because we've given that kind of devotion

325
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,940
 to something else entirely.

326
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,460
 We can't give God in prayer,

327
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,400
 through humble pursuit,

328
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,980
 the kind of devotion he deserves

329
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,580
 because we've given that sort of devotion

330
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,260
 to something else altogether.

331
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,300
 Like some of you are so devoted to your job.

332
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,980
 Like we're coming into review season.

333
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,860
 And so you've got to finish well, you know,

334
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,940
 I'm about to sit down with my boss.

335
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,100
 He's about to review how I've done this last year.

336
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,680
 And I want to like race to the finish line.

337
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,520
 I want him to look at me and say,

338
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,260
 "Man, I'm so glad we hired you.

339
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,780
 You're the best pickup we've ever gotten."

340
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,060
 And so you're devoted to that.

341
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,780
 Others of you, summer's here,

342
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,640
 sun's out, guns out, you know,

343
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,540
 you're working out, you're hitting the gym

344
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,820
 because it's full season, baby.

345
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,180
 Like you're doing everything in your power

346
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,460
 to show up and show out there.

347
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,580
 Some of you, you're just devoted

348
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,120
 to getting through the week.

349
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,780
 Like it's miserable Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday,

350
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
 but the weekend will be better.

351
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
 Or that trip will be better.

352
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,780
 Or that event will be better.

353
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,620
 Or that extracurricular I have coming up,

354
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,100
 that will be better.

355
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,140
 Some of you, you're so committed.

356
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,660
 You're so devoted to your community.

357
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,780
 That instead of going and talking to God,

358
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,340
 you're just talking to other people.

359
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,380
 Believers, yes, but other people about it.

360
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,980
 You're confessing sin, you're investing in relationship,

361
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,560
 making strategic deposits in the lives of people.

362
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,500
 You're serving others.

363
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,020
 You know, you're doing everything you can in community.

364
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,180
 And here's the reason, and it could be something else.

365
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,380
 You know, it doesn't have to be those things.

366
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,300
 It could be something else.

367
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,380
 What is it though that you are devoted to?

368
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,460
 Answer it.

369
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,220
 Like, what would you write down for that?

370
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,420
 All of us are devoted to something.

371
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,420
 And I'm not saying that these things are intrinsically bad.

372
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,540
 I'm not saying they're unworthy of your devotion.

373
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,140
 But what I am saying is some things are more deserving

374
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,420
 of your devotion than others.

375
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,220
 And prayer's at the top of that list.

376
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,940
 Like, prayer should be our first priority,

377
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,240
 not our last resort.

378
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,700
 Like, it's not the thing you do

379
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,780
 whenever you run out of options.

380
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,040
 It's the thing you do before you look to other options.

381
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,060
 Leonard Ravenhill, British evangelist, author,

382
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,600
 just one fiery individual, he said this.

383
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,660
 "No man is greater than his prayer life.

384
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,940
 "The pastor who is not praying is playing.

385
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,060
 "The people who are not praying are straying.

386
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,260
 "We have many organizers, but few agonizers.

387
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,720
 "Many players and payers, but few prayers.

388
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,700
 "Many singers, but few clingers.

389
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,240
 "Lots of pastors, but few wrestlers.

390
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
 "Many fears, few tears.

391
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
 "Much fashion, but little passion.

392
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,080
 "Many interferers, few intercessors.

393
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,480
 "Many riders, but few fighters.

394
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,820
 "Failing here, we fail everywhere."

395
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,560
 Why is that?

396
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,880
 What's Leonard getting at?

397
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,680
 A prayerless person is a powerless person.

398
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,240
 A prayerless person is a powerless person.

399
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,500
 Some of you, with whatever that thing,

400
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,800
 the object of all your attention in life is right now,

401
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,080
 you have worked so hard.

402
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,840
 You have checked all the traps.

403
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,040
 You have strategized to the best of your ability.

404
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,080
 You have given a good college try.

405
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,460
 You have absolutely poured on everything you have to give

406
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,780
 to change that situation.

407
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,240
 But man, you're just shooting blanks

408
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
 because you've not prayed about it.

409
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,540
 There's no power in your attempt

410
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,260
 because there's no power apart from God.

411
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:15,300
 So what are we supposed to pray for?

412
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,580
 Two things, real quick.

413
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
 We won't spend a ton of time on this.

414
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,420
 The first thing that we pray for

415
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,260
 is we pray for opportunity.

416
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,460
 That's what Paul talks about in verse three.

417
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,720
 He says, "At the same time, pray also for us,

418
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,260
 "that God may open to us a door for the word

419
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,340
 "to declare the mystery of Christ,

420
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,360
 "on account of which I'm in prison."

421
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,740
 This is crazy.

422
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,620
 Just picture it.

423
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,680
 Paul is sitting in prison,

424
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,260
 bound under Roman authority,

425
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,880
 very likely persecuted in this moment,

426
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,220
 but his prayers are not that God

427
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,020
 would open the door to his cell.

428
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,140
 His prayers are that God would open the door

429
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,180
 for an opportunity to share the gospel.

430
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,300
 That's convicting.

431
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,740
 Like some of us, myself included,

432
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,900
 have been in moments where we have been begging,

433
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,180
 "God, please, just get me out of here.

434
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,060
 "Like I've been working so hard in this,

435
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,000
 "and yet it's not at all what I expected.

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
 "Like God, I'm ready for the next thing.

437
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,060
 "I feel so stuck right now.

438
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,180
 "Please, won't you lead me out?

439
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,400
 "Won't you open a door?

440
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,600
 "Won't you make a way?"

441
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,680
 And yet God is standing on the other side,

442
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
 knowing well what's behind that door,

443
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,860
 and he's saying, "I love you too much to open it.

444
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,340
 "I will leave you where you are.

445
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,500
 "Do not focus at the opportunities out ahead.

446
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,700
 "Focus on the opportunities here at hand.

447
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,500
 "Think about the now.

448
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,980
 "Work here in the moment."

449
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,900
 I love it.

450
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,760
 This isn't even in my notes,

451
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,580
 but when you look at Adam and Eve,

452
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,840
 before Eve ever comes along,

453
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,340
 God's got Adam lined up, man,

454
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,840
 and that brother wants a wife.

455
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,200
 He's like some of you.

456
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,700
 And so he's waiting, and he's waiting, and he's waiting,

457
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
 and you know what he does, though?

458
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,800
 Rather than getting frustrated,

459
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,900
 "God, why won't you send her?"

460
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,180
 He goes to work.

461
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,400
 He names every animal in that garden.

462
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,480
 That brother sees the opportunity.

463
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,040
 He did good work.

464
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,860
 And then God opened the door in his own time.

465
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,180
 Some of you need to trust that the Lord does love you.

466
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,700
 He is good, and he will open the door at the right time,

467
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,980
 but perhaps he hasn't opened it yet

468
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,360
 because right now he's already opened a door

469
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,320
 that he's waiting for you to walk through.

470
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,080
 (man whistling)

471
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
 So you pray for opportunity.

472
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,360
 Verse four tells us that we pray for clarity.

473
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,560
 Says that I may make it clear,

474
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,960
 which is how I ought to speak.

475
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
 I love this, coming from the apostle Paul,

476
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
 because next to Jesus,

477
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,760
 he's the best preacher we've ever seen,

478
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,440
 and yet he's praying for clarity.

479
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,240
 Some of you, you feel so unfit to share the gospel.

480
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,960
 You feel so unfit to talk about your spirituality

481
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,400
 because you're not a poetic savant,

482
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,440
 because you're not a master orator,

483
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,760
 and yet Paul's saying, "Man, just preach it plain, brother.

484
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,000
 "Like, just tell 'em how it is.

485
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
 "Be understandable."

486
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,200
 He prays for clarity.

487
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,960
 We should pray for clarity, too.

488
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,840
 This is the first step to saving the world

489
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,080
 that we should take, porch.

490
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,480
 We pray with devotion.

491
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,740
 But as we go to verse five, Paul gives us the next.

492
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,780
 It says, "Walk in wisdom toward outsiders,

493
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,780
 "making the best use of the time."

494
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,920
 The second step that Paul gives us

495
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,960
 is that we walk with wisdom.

496
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,200
 Paul says we walk, which incidentally,

497
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
 is a pretty underwhelming activity

498
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,760
 if you're describing the Christian life.

499
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,600
 Like, that's it?

500
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,420
 We walk?

501
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,880
 Like, couldn't we put something better in there?

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,360
 Like, we fight, you know, or we march, or we wrestle.

503
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,340
 Like, I don't know what your better descriptor would be,

504
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,400
 but Paul says, "No, we walk."

505
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,000
 Like, this is the way we move through the Christian life.

506
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,840
 We walk.

507
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,720
 Why does he choose this?

508
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,960
 Because this was the primary mode of transportation

509
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,840
 for every single person in the ancient Near East.

510
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,400
 If you wanted to get from point A to point B,

511
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,160
 more likely than not, you were walking there.

512
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,480
 All of Jesus's ministry, he walked from town to town.

513
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,840
 This was something you did every single day.

514
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,200
 It was ordinary.

515
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
 And in the same way,

516
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,680
 our spiritual life consists of walking every single day.

517
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,280
 I love it.

518
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,160
 Like, Paul is telling us,

519
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,720
 "Your Christianity should look ordinary.

520
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
 "It shouldn't be extraordinary.

521
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,000
 "It shouldn't be reserved.

522
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,160
 "And when you're here on Tuesday nights,

523
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,200
 "you show up on Sunday mornings,

524
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,280
 "you're around that group of Christian friends."

525
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,160
 Like, Christian's not a switch you flip

526
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,200
 whenever you're in the proper context.

527
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,840
 Now, that would be an extraordinary expression.

528
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,240
 No, it's an ordinary expression.

529
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,160
 It is an everyday, day by day,

530
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,760
 rise and grind type of life.

531
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,640
 It's ordinary.

532
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,440
 And it's good that this is the case

533
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,440
 because it requires our consistency.

534
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,200
 I love the way one commentator put it.

535
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,000
 "The Christian walk merely consists

536
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 "of two steps repeated over and over and over again.

537
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,640
 "Put off the old and put on the new."

538
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,040
 Which is a reference to Colossians chapter three.

539
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,240
 You see, Paul's point here

540
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,640
 is that we should live in such a way

541
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,200
 that our actions back up our convictions.

542
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,240
 Because the world,

543
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,160
 the world is far less interested in your talk

544
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,460
 and they are far more interested in your walk.

545
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:30,680
 They wanna believe how you behave.

546
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,480
 They don't want to adopt

547
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
 something you yourself have not adopted.

548
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,600
 So Christian, it's imperative

549
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,440
 that your convictions are supported by actions.

550
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,720
 That you don't grumble against other people or complain.

551
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,120
 But instead you reserve your words.

552
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,320
 You bite your tongue

553
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,320
 because you know that you should speak only if it builds up.

554
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,160
 It means that you don't run into frantic, stress out.

555
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,080
 Everything is breaking.

556
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,760
 Like it's all going into chaos.

557
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,120
 Like you don't worry when things fall on red alert

558
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,840
 because you know that you need not be anxious.

559
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,760
 But in everything about prayer and petition,

560
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,400
 you present your requests to God.

561
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,680
 We're supposed to walk in wisdom.

562
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,480
 We're supposed to live in a way

563
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,840
 that looks wildly odd to the watching world.

564
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,280
 Like I preach up here every week.

565
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,540
 And I do so with a kind of animation and intensity

566
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,040
 because I don't wanna look casual

567
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,840
 about the things we talk about.

568
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,560
 No, I want to back up all of my convictions

569
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,600
 with urgency and action.

570
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,320
 I want you to see I believe this stuff

571
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,040
 and we should live in a way that believes it too.

572
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,320
 Believers are known by their behavior.

573
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,120
 So what do your behaviors look like?

574
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,000
 So what's the walk supposed to look like?

575
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,280
 Well, I don't know if you've done much walking in your life.

576
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,440
 Not just to and fro from here and there,

577
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
 but concerted, deliberate exercise.

578
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,520
 Something that Brooke and I have recently picked up.

579
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,800
 And so every time I know that we're gonna go on a walk,

580
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,740
 I'm always preceded with two questions.

581
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,240
 I've got to know a couple of different things

582
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,520
 before I set out and hit the open trail.

583
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,320
 Number one, I always wanna know where are we walking?

584
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,040
 Like, is this just a casual stroll around the neighborhood

585
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,480
 or is this over the river and through the woods

586
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,320
 kind of stuff?

587
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,720
 Like, are we going on an adventure

588
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,120
 or are we gonna be back in 30?

589
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,040
 I just wanna know where are we going?

590
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,680
 And then I wanna know how are we planning to walk?

591
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,360
 Is it leisurely or are we moving hastily

592
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,840
 with a brisk pace and a lot of purpose?

593
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,000
 I need to know because it's going to determine

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,240
 my expectation.

595
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,680
 Paul thankfully looks at us

596
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,880
 and he answers those same questions.

597
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,660
 He tells us where we walk and how we walk.

598
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,080
 He's already told us how we walk.

599
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,960
 We walk in wisdom.

600
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,060
 That was the point.

601
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,260
 You walk with wisdom.

602
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,100
 What's wisdom?

603
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,920
 What does that even mean?

604
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,860
 Well, according to the Bible,

605
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,640
 wisdom is judging correctly

606
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,680
 and following the best course of action

607
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,940
 in a given situation.

608
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,580
 It's like that friend you call,

609
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,980
 whenever the bottom falls out,

610
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,820
 you don't know what to do,

611
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,500
 but they always have the right answer.

612
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,020
 They always know what to do.

613
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,860
 That friend has what?

614
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,900
 They have wisdom.

615
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,860
 They have street smarts.

616
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,680
 They know how to succeed in any situation.

617
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,100
 We're supposed to walk with a kind of wisdom

618
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,220
 that's characterized similarly.

619
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,360
 We walk this way.

620
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,860
 And what it does is it leads us to look pretty odd,

621
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,500
 but that's okay

622
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,420
 because uncommon people make uncommon moves.

623
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,300
 Uncommon people make uncommon moves.

624
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,640
 If people are not walking up to you and saying,

625
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,620
 man, you're just different.

626
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,460
 Like you just,

627
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,500
 you don't strike me as the average,

628
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,700
 ordinary run of the mill individual.

629
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,720
 Like, why are you the way you are?

630
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,580
 Why do you do the things you do?

631
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,340
 You're probably not that uncommon

632
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,220
 and thus you're probably not walking in wisdom.

633
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,440
 The way of the Christian walk

634
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,800
 is not the way of the world's walk.

635
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,060
 It looks abnormal.

636
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,460
 So how abnormal do you look?

637
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,220
 Paul says in 2 Corinthians 6,

638
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,340
 verses two through four,

639
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,580
 behold, now is the favorable time.

640
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,140
 Behold, now is the day of salvation.

641
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,420
 We put no obstacle in anyone's way

642
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,680
 so that no fault may be found in our ministry.

643
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,920
 But as servants of God,

644
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,820
 we commend ourselves in every way.

645
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,300
 We're willing to walk in a way

646
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,600
 that commends ourselves and our gospel to other people

647
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,740
 by great endurance and afflictions

648
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,540
 and hardships and calamities and beatings

649
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,980
 and imprisonments and riots and labors

650
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,000
 and sleepless nights and hunger.

651
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,020
 And it goes on.

652
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,240
 That's pretty odd that people would do that

653
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,380
 to lead others to Christ.

654
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,740
 Yes?

655
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,480
 Like that's not the way of the world.

656
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,460
 You should look different.

657
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,420
 You should be uncommon.

658
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,340
 And yet this sort of uncommonality,

659
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,180
 what it does is it allows us to walk in a way

660
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:08,340
 that presents a persuasive case

661
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,540
 that Jesus is who he says he is

662
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,500
 and he is worthy of following

663
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,660
 because we ourselves are following him too.

664
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,220
 That's how we walk.

665
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,900
 Where do we walk?

666
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,660
 We walk towards outsiders.

667
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,780
 I love that Paul doesn't just say we walk with God.

668
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,500
 No, we walk toward outsiders,

669
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,060
 not towards your holy huddle,

670
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,480
 not towards your Christian clique,

671
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,700
 not towards your friend group

672
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,060
 that you see each and every day of the week.

673
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,260
 No, you walk towards outsiders.

674
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,820
 That's where you walk.

675
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,700
 Not away from them, but to them,

676
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,020
 which is an intimidating prospect.

677
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,840
 I get it, man.

678
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,340
 Like I'm an introvert, you know?

679
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,060
 Like I'm quite all right just doing me.

680
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,940
 Like I don't necessarily need to be around people.

681
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,500
 I don't like to be the center of attention.

682
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,940
 I enjoy going to movies by myself.

683
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,440
 And yet,

684
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,640
 and yet as one pastor said,

685
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,140
 your personality type does not get to determine

686
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,100
 your purpose.

687
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,940
 Like there's a variety of hardwirings in this room,

688
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,300
 but if you're a believer, a follower of Christ,

689
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,300
 you and I and all alike have the same purpose,

690
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,540
 which is to know God and to make him known.

691
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,860
 We walk toward the outsider.

692
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,900
 And we do so by seizing every moment,

693
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,780
 by making the best use of time.

694
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,500
 I remember in college, one of my best friends today,

695
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,340
 I didn't know him at the time.

696
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
 I knew of him, he and I were not close,

697
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,860
 but I would see him at the gym every single day.

698
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,580
 Like I would go and he'd be there.

699
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,500
 And the reason he stood out to me was not just because

700
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 we were at the gym every single day around the same time.

701
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,680
 Like that's pretty average.

702
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,260
 What was uncommon about this brother

703
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,020
 is he was there with four to five other guys

704
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,620
 and they were all working out together

705
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,900
 and they weren't just working out together.

706
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,740
 They were reading Bible verses

707
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,380
 and they were taking that as fuel and motivation

708
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,780
 to like deadlift PRs.

709
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,020
 It was the weirdest thing in the world,

710
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,460
 but I couldn't help but notice.

711
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,980
 And so later on in our friendship,

712
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,940
 I finally looked at him and I was like,

713
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,380
 "Brother, like what was going on back there?

714
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,860
 Like one guy would hit you with Romans 5.8

715
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,900
 and you would walk up and you would max rep right there.

716
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,020
 Like, how did that work?

717
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,140
 What were you doing?"

718
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,100
 And I love it.

719
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,940
 He looked at me and he was like,

720
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,380
 "You know, it's a couple hours every day

721
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,700
 that I could either spend on myself

722
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,340
 or I could spend on someone else.

723
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,180
 And so, because Christ was willing to give his time for me,

724
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,680
 I will give my time for them."

725
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,900
 Make the best use of the time.

726
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,360
 Walk with wisdom towards outsiders.

727
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,660
 The last step he gives us in verse six,

728
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,460
 the final step for saving the world.

729
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,180
 Let your speech always be gracious,

730
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,380
 seasoned with salt that you may know

731
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,660
 how you ought to answer each person.

732
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,180
 The third step that Paul gives

733
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,540
 is he tells us to speak with grace.

734
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,580
 Speak with grace.

735
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,860
 Which means that our speech should be marked

736
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,700
 with an abnormal, undeserved kind of kindness.

737
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,580
 That's what grace is.

738
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,740
 Grace is unmerited favor.

739
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,260
 It's meant you don't deserve this,

740
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,420
 but I'm going to extend to you my love,

741
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,100
 my kindness, my compassion.

742
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,020
 And so that's how we're meant to speak.

743
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,900
 There should be a friendliness to the way

744
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,780
 in which we talk to other people.

745
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,820
 Like at my last job, we had this six foot rule on staff

746
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,000
 that if anybody was ever within six feet of you,

747
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,900
 you should engage them and you should do so kindly.

748
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,500
 And so I took this to heart.

749
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,440
 I thought it was a really good principle.

750
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,540
 And so I'm doing this and I'm at church on a Sunday

751
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,380
 and I see a guy and he's within my radius.

752
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,660
 And so I spring into action.

753
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,220
 I'm like, "Hey man, how's it going?"

754
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,700
 And he was like, "What is with this place?

755
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,260
 You're the sixth person to come up and tell me hello.

756
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,460
 This is the nicest place I've ever been.

757
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,700
 What are y'all doing?"

758
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,580
 And I was like, "Man, you know,

759
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,300
 Jesus was welcoming to us when we were new.

760
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,260
 And so we're welcoming to those that are new themselves."

761
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
 And he looked at me,

762
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,380
 he said, "Man, I think the world could use

763
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,460
 a little bit of that."

764
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,300
 I was like, "It's funny you should say that.

765
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,100
 The Bible would agree."

766
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,900
 You know, like that's what Paul's pointing to.

767
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,100
 Paul is saying that our speech should be gracious.

768
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
 It should be gracious and it should be seasoned with salt.

769
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,860
 Which if you've run in Christian circles long enough,

770
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,140
 you've heard that idea, you know, salt of the earth.

771
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,060
 But what does it even mean?

772
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,520
 Well, in the ancient world, salt had two specific purposes.

773
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,420
 It was used for seasoning and preserving.

774
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,060
 And our speech should be the same way.

775
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,900
 Like your speech should have some flavor.

776
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,180
 Like no one likes to eat bland food

777
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,180
 and no one likes to hear a bland gospel.

778
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,640
 Like there should be some flavor in the way you talk.

779
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,640
 Like it is odd that we can get animated and interested

780
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,560
 in all manner of things, business and politics

781
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,260
 and sports and fashion.

782
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,980
 And yet we can remain unanimated

783
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,380
 and uninterested in the person of Jesus.

784
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,060
 That's crazy.

785
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,820
 That makes no sense.

786
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,620
 Every single thing is going to dust.

787
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,700
 It's all gonna wash away.

788
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,960
 It's all gonna wear out, except for who?

789
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,900
 The person of Christ that has made it available

790
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,500
 that we all can live with him forever and always.

791
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,620
 So why would we not get jazzed up and energized

792
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,300
 at the thought of him?

793
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,200
 We should be deeply animated.

794
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,820
 There should be salt, seasoning, flavor, excitement,

795
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,560
 enthusiasm in the way that we talk about him.

796
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,140
 There's no one like him.

797
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
 He's incomparable.

798
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,940
 He is wondrous beyond imagination.

799
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,380
 And yet we just talk about him like this.

800
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,340
 How do you think he talks about you?

801
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,860
 I hope it's not like that.

802
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,840
 And in fact, I know it's not like that

803
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,360
 because you need only read this

804
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,920
 to see that he would go every depth.

805
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,760
 He would go every length.

806
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,920
 He would move every width to get to you.

807
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,420
 So how are you talking about him?

808
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,800
 But it's not just that our speech should be seasoned

809
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,160
 with flavor and fire and fullness,

810
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,800
 but it also should prevent corruption.

811
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,240
 Like it should preserve.

812
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,540
 Like, what does that mean?

813
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,920
 A simple way to put it is it should be encouraging.

814
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,760
 What does encouragement?

815
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,680
 Encouragement doesn't tear people down.

816
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,880
 It holds them up.

817
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,720
 It builds them up.

818
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,160
 Literally, the definition of an encouragement

819
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,840
 is to put courage into someone.

820
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,720
 And that's what we should do.

821
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
 We should speak encouraging words.

822
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,960
 That's what Paul says in a different letter.

823
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,080
 He says in Ephesians 4, 29,

824
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,620
 "Let no corrupting talk,

825
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,600
 "that which is not characteristic of a preservation

826
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 "of preserving nature,

827
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,320
 "let no corrupting talk come out of your mouth,

828
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,720
 "but only such as is good for building up,

829
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,600
 "as fits the occasion,

830
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,320
 "that it may give grace to those who hear."

831
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
 This is how the believer is meant to speak.

832
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,700
 Like Charles Spurgeon, favorite preacher, he said this,

833
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,160
 "No reason exists why the preaching of the gospel

834
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,220
 "should be a miserable operation,

835
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,680
 "either to the speaker or to the hearer."

836
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,040
 There's no reason.

837
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,960
 It doesn't need be miserable.

838
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,400
 It can be both full of flavor and it can be encouraging,

839
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,600
 which I just love.

840
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,440
 Like the gospel, it is full of gravity.

841
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,680
 It is the most weighty, significant,

842
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,080
 meaningful thing in all the world.

843
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,560
 Some of you are here and you've never heard it.

844
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,800
 Welcome.

845
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,280
 You will hear no better news anywhere else.

846
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,200
 It is full of gravity.

847
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,760
 And it is full of gladness.

848
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,420
 The Christian life is not a tragedy.

849
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,200
 It's a comedy, not in the sitcom sort of way,

850
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,720
 but in the way that knows there's a happy ending ahead

851
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,880
 because Christ Jesus has won.

852
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,600
 He has overcome the dead.

853
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,100
 (congregation applauding)

854
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:29,240
 So that gives us every reason to share the good news.

855
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 To share the good news.

856
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,640
 How does that make you feel?

857
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,940
 (congregation cheering)

858
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,700
 I know for some of us, that's the response,

859
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,940
 but listen, man, like I once sat in your seat

860
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,500
 and I would hear these moments come along.

861
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
 We're at the end of the conference, the end of the series.

862
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,080
 Oh no, like,

863
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,800
 the evangelistic guilt trip.

864
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,140
 It's been so great, but now I'm supposed to get out there

865
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,120
 and do it, man.

866
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,420
 I dreaded moments like these.

867
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
 'Cause I didn't feel capable.

868
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,560
 I didn't feel worthy.

869
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,920
 I didn't honestly want to share the gospel.

870
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,640
 I was quite content knowing God

871
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
 and letting someone else make him known.

872
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,300
 So why does God choose to use you and me

873
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,680
 to share the good news?

874
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,960
 Like, this is hard.

875
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,000
 I know I'm an introvert.

876
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,360
 I mean, this is part of my story.

877
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,320
 This is a hard thing.

878
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,080
 And I also know that God could do this some other way.

879
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,500
 Like, he could write it in the sky.

880
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,300
 Believe in my son for the forgiveness of your sins

881
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,260
 and life everlasting.

882
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,300
 Like, he could put it up there in plain English.

883
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,700
 So why does he choose to use you and me?

884
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,540
 Well, why do we share about anything?

885
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,140
 The answer is easy.

886
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,780
 Because we think it's great.

887
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,460
 That's why we share about things.

888
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,280
 We believe they're great.

889
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,520
 That's why you talk about your spin class

890
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,060
 or that new restaurant or the show you're watching.

891
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,220
 You think it's really great.

892
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,020
 And as you shared, you believe that other people

893
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,620
 will think it's great as well.

894
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,480
 It's easy why we share.

895
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,400
 A better question is why does God want us to share?

896
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,760
 Why does he want us to?

897
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,780
 And I believe this is the thing that's so amazing.

898
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,240
 Because when we consider the answer to that question,

899
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,320
 it reveals the state of our affections for him.

900
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,500
 See, there's no question.

901
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,160
 Does God want me to share the gospel?

902
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,400
 No, there's no question.

903
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,240
 The question instead is,

904
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,680
 why don't I want to tell other people the gospel?

905
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,340
 Which is a really heavy thing to consider.

906
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:41,140
 And yet it's a really amazing thing to process.

907
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,440
 Because God in his kindness,

908
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,980
 I just think this is brilliant.

909
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,780
 He has chosen to use you and me

910
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,700
 to tell the world about Jesus

911
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,420
 rather than some other method

912
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,500
 because he knows in so doing,

913
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,600
 he will expose what the state of our love for him is.

914
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:08,480
 He leads us into places of evangelism

915
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,380
 and causes us to consider whether we do

916
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,500
 or we do not want to share this good news,

917
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,780
 that it might trigger a spiritual check engine light

918
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,520
 on the dashboard of your heart,

919
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,300
 that you might willingly see it pop the hood

920
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
 and evaluate, God, what's wrong with me?

921
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,620
 Why don't I want to tell others of you?

922
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,780
 Like God's heart for evangelism,

923
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,780
 it's not to make this whole thing feel like a tour duty

924
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,700
 or time to serve.

925
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,040
 Like he's not trying to obligate you into working for him.

926
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,020
 That's not his objective.

927
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,240
 It's not a, I did my part, now you better do yours.

928
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,340
 That's not his end.

929
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,980
 No, he calls us to share the hope of Jesus

930
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,460
 because in the process of doing it,

931
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,380
 it regularly reveals how much we love him.

932
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,820
 Then here's the crazy thing.

933
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,420
 And I need you to hear this

934
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,180
 because it's masterful from the master.

935
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:16,460
 He wants you so much, longs for your heart so much

936
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,980
 that he would implement a strategy

937
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,280
 to expose whether you want him in return.

938
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,660
 And if the answer to that question is no,

939
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,900
 then the solution to that answer is what?

940
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:37,540
 Then tell yourself the good news

941
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,300
 of a God who would seek and save even the likes of you.

942
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,540
 Before you tell others, tell yourself.

943
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,180
 You be reminded.

944
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,160
 Have your affections grown cold?

945
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,980
 Then repeat the story of a God that would save anybody.

946
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,620
 And let your affections blaze once again.

947
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:08,500
 How do I know that this is the way God's working

948
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,260
 as he tells us to go out and to fulfill the great commission,

949
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,140
 to proclaim the good news,

950
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,100
 to share the hope we have in Jesus?

951
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,940
 How do I know, man?

952
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,500
 Like, how am I so confident

953
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,140
 that he so badly wants to be connected to you

954
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,300
 that he would do this,

955
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,600
 that he would implement a strategy

956
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,000
 that would expose whether we want him in return?

957
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,180
 Because he sent his son at a time

958
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,740
 when we did not want him,

959
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,340
 yet he wanted us anyways.

960
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,740
 This is the gospel that Jesus Christ came

961
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,620
 and he sought after a people that did not love

962
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,040
 nor were willing to return the kind of affection

963
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,600
 he so freely lavished upon them.

964
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,560
 Like Jesus is a God come man that was so devoted to us

965
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,120
 that he considered us his first priority,

966
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,640
 not his last resort.

967
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,000
 Like all along he's seen you and he said,

968
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,620
 you're my first, you're my choice pick.

969
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,640
 You're not the one that I guess I'm gonna settle for

970
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,200
 'cause they said, no, I can have whoever I want

971
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
 and I want all people to come to me.

972
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,040
 And so I'm coming to you, I'm moving to you,

973
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,700
 I'm devoted to you 'cause I want to bring you home.

974
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,500
 But he's not just devoted to us,

975
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,580
 he also walks towards us.

976
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,180
 Like when we were not on the inside, but on the outside,

977
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,180
 Jesus walked towards us and with love in his heart,

978
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:39,540
 he walked past us and up Calvary's Hill

979
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,600
 where we ourselves were meant to walk.

980
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,160
 And it's not just that he would walk towards,

981
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,480
 it's also that he would speak grace to us.

982
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,480
 That as he hung upon that cross

983
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,860
 and he stared down at a people

984
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,260
 that wanted nothing to do with the likes of him,

985
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,800
 he would speak these words, father, forgive them.

986
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,860
 They do not know what they are doing.

987
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:10,520
 How do you change the world?

988
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,880
 You pray, you walk and you speak.

989
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,000
 And the reason we know this is the case

990
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 is because Christ himself has done the same for you and me.

991
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,220
 Let me pray for us.

992
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,980
 Father,

993
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:38,300
 I pray that there would be no mistake in this room, God,

994
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,200
 just how badly you want for us.

995
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,880
 So badly, God, does your heart burn

996
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,600
 for the people in this room.

997
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:51,840
 That you would send your one and only son

998
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,940
 to do what we could not, to live life so very perfectly.

999
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,720
 Yet not only that, he also bore the death we deserve, God,

1000
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,160
 the wages of sin is death.

1001
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,440
 And yet he said, I will go in your place.

1002
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,040
 I will die your death.

1003
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,760
 I will take the hit.

1004
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,640
 And he rose forth from that grave.

1005
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,240
 And as he did, so he said,

1006
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,640
 and because I have done all of these things,

1007
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,040
 believe in me and come with me where I am.

1008
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,840
 Be with me for all eternity.

1009
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,440
 Everything else is a waste.

1010
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,360
 It's all going to wash.

1011
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,840
 It's all going to rubbish.

1012
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,680
 But not you, if only you place your faith in me,

1013
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,080
 you go on forever.

1014
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,000
 We go on forever.

1015
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,080
 God, I pray that you would move here in this space.

1016
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
 As we come God here to the last song,

1017
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,980
 I just ask that we would just have

1018
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,240
 an honest moment with you.

1019
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,040
 So often we come into this room and for some of us, God,

1020
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,860
 I know 'cause I myself was the same.

1021
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,560
 We just put on a front.

1022
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,900
 We keep up the show.

1023
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,200
 We play the part and yet God tonight, right now,

1024
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,800
 this moment can be honest and authentic and real.

1025
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,160
 For you God are honest and authentic and real

1026
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,960
 in your love for us, God.

1027
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,320
 We love you.

1028
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,840
 We rejoice God for we have reason to rejoice.

1029
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,920
 The Christian life has a happy ending.

1030
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,320
 And it's all because of the name of Jesus.

1031
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,120
 Amen.

1032
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:38,120
