[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.500]   - How we doing, Ports?
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000]   (congregation cheering)
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.960]   Come on, come on.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.000]   Continuing our Vice and Virtue series.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.680]   I wanna start by just kind of flashing back
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.120]   to my life before Christ, BC days.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.560]   I'm here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.320]   I'm not walking with Jesus out of college.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.400]   And every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.960]   was spent at a bar or a club
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.640]   and really one particular club that we would always go to.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920]   So I moved five times all within one mile
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.120]   of lower Greenville.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.520]   And so that's kind of was the uptown of that day,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.160]   the West 7th, the Baker Street in Houston.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.120]   It was just, it was the place where you would party.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.680]   And so we would go to this particular place all the time.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.760]   And on one Friday night, I'm there.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200]   And here's what would happen is we'd start at the apartment
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.120]   and with the tequila shots.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.040]   And then from there, we would move to beer
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.480]   and then we'd go to the club.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.960]   And that's when we'd open the bar tab
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.720]   and start with the mixed drinks
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.520]   because I would dance better when I was drunk,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.120]   or at least I would think I'd dance better
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.280]   when I was drunk, you know?
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280]   And so anyways, we're there,
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.800]   I'm moving my way to the dance floor.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.440]   And so dancing, having a good time,
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.240]   see this blonde girl across the way,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.360]   we might make eye contact, smile at each other.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.400]   She starts coming my way and this is awesome.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   And so we're dancing, you know,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.480]   and it starts off a little bit of space in between.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.640]   She has long blonde hair, beautiful,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.800]   short little tiny dress.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.960]   And so we're dancing, looking at each other,
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.520]   you know, all is great.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.000]   And you like that, how I dance?
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.160]   And so, yeah, and there's a space in between us.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.920]   And as the hours go by, and as the drinks are flowing,
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.800]   we get closer and closer.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.000]   And, you know, and sorry to be graphic,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.800]   but we're on each other at this point, you know, grinding.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.680]   And she's, you know, whispering in my ear,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.800]   says, "Hey, I want you to go home with me."
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.280]   And I'm thinking, you know, this is awesome
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.680]   'cause that's really the goal of life in this time
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.360]   is we go to the club and hope to go home
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.240]   or take someone home with us.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.880]   And so my mind is fast forwarding
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.240]   to what's gonna happen later on.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   And the club is amazing because the lights are down
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.200]   and all you see is the neon, the DJs up there mixing,
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.480]   the beat is thumping and it's just a party and it's fun.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.240]   And it feels like this perfect environment,
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.920]   like just ecstasy kind of deal.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.680]   And so we keep going and the night's moving on
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.880]   and really we literally dance the night away,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.840]   me and my new friend, and it's 2 a.m. at this point.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.960]   And so the bar's closing, DJ plays, it's closing time.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.400]   And we kind of, I start looking for my friends,
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.320]   she started looking for her friends.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.100]   And we were there, that takes so long
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.720]   that they turn the lights on.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.200]   And when they turn the lights on in the club,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.240]   it's just everything becomes different.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.160]   This place that was perfect and full of ecstasy and fun,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.700]   you start to see all the little bar napkins
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.240]   all over the floor and how dirty it is.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   And oh, somebody threw up in the corner,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.560]   that's what that smell was.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.840]   And there's this kind of musty beer smell
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.980]   that just increases when they turn the lights on.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.760]   And all the sexy co-eds kind of look like
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.040]   incoherent zombies at this point.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.400]   You know, they've spilt drinks on their shirts
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.640]   and they're all sweaty and hot and it's kind of nasty.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.520]   And then I see her, and it's not that she's not beautiful,
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.480]   but she just appears kind of needy.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.120]   And she has these big bags under her eyes
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.760]   and this kind of look in her face.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   And at this point, I've sobered up enough to say,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.820]   hey, I gotta go home.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.880]   And she says, and again, invites me over to her place.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.100]   And my friends are there now and I'm like,
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.160]   no, I gotta go.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   And then she kind of moves to like begging.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.680]   And she grabs my arm and she kind of starts pulling me
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.400]   and I'm like, no, I gotta go.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.800]   And what's going on is her lustful desires
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.800]   are making her unbelievably unattractive.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.520]   And then she does something really weird
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.560]   I didn't see coming.
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.960]   She pulls out her purse and pulls out a couple hundred
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.040]   dollars and she says, I'll give you this.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.440]   Now listen, I'm not the most attractive dude on the planet.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.680]   I get that, okay.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.320]   And this has never happened to me before.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.200]   And this isn't where I'm kind of boasting
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.760]   about what happened in the past.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   That's not my heart here.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.160]   What I'm saying, and my heart in saying this
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.920]   is I never will forget this moment,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.120]   even though I was intoxicated.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.960]   It just was like, oh man, something's not right there.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   Like your lust has moved you to a dysfunctional place.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.880]   And I gotta go.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.780]   I gotta go quickly.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.640]   I gotta get out of here.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.960]   And I don't know where you're at in your walk with Jesus.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.680]   I don't know if you've ever had that experience
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.180]   where the lights turn on, but my heart tonight,
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.880]   what I hope to do tonight is to turn the light on lust.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.280]   That you would see it for what it is.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.040]   That you would know what it is.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.080]   'Cause it seems like it's this thing that is there
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.240]   and you don't really know, is it natural, is it not?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.960]   What am I supposed to do with it?
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.760]   And where, it's gonna take you somewhere.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.440]   So we're in a series, Vice and Virtue.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   And this evening we're talking about lust and self-control.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.080]   And so last week we talked on forgiveness.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.580]   If you missed it, I'd encourage you to podcast it,
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.520]   to go in the Poor Chap and get that.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.760]   Really it was the gospel.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.340]   That would be a message to share,
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.640]   like many of the messages in this series.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.360]   But I feel like God did something special last week
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.140]   and I pray again that he's going to do it tonight.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.780]   Tonight is mature content.
[00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.840]   If you came here with your eight year old,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.280]   one, how did you get in?
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.840]   Two, I'm gonna pray in a moment
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.060]   and I'm gonna ask you to leave.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.460]   And if you're here, you're listening to this
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.400]   anywhere in the world, you're under 18,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.100]   I'm gonna ask that you turn it off.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.340]   We are gonna speak really candidly
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.940]   on this topic this evening.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.180]   And at this church, I don't know what church you grew up in,
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.660]   at this church we just handle these topics really candidly.
[00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.380]   And especially on a Tuesday,
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.500]   feel a lot of freedom to speak really directly
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.380]   to this issue.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.240]   So let me pray.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.620]   And that's where you would exit, again, if you're under 18.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.660]   Lord, we do just ask for your help this evening.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.020]   I know that the enemy hates this message,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.260]   hates this text, hates your scripture,
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.160]   hates me and these people,
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.940]   and wants to see them abuse themselves on this topic.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.720]   Father, I know my friends are all over the place
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.060]   in regards to their struggles.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.120]   Lord, I pray for those that are listening online,
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.540]   couldn't get in the parking lot here,
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.480]   those in Houston and those in Fort Worth
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.480]   and El Paso and Tulsa and all over the world, Lord,
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.560]   that you would heal us tonight.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.240]   I pray this would be a resource, God,
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.360]   as we read from the scriptures,
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.100]   that it would be a resource that we share with others
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.440]   and those who struggle, our friends and our peers.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.920]   Set us free in Jesus's name, amen.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.200]   Now, feeding your lusts is going to cost you
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.800]   more than you could have ever imagined.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.880]   I'm going to speak from four authorities right now,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.080]   and they're not all created equal,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.680]   but the first one is the scripture.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.320]   This is God who loves you, who has a plan for your life,
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   and so he puts sexual sin in a special category.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.480]   He says, "Thee who sin sexually, sins against his self."
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.720]   He alludes to, Jesus alludes to,
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.440]   to sexual sin can drag you all the way to hell,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.160]   and that's a statement that's going to need some unpacking.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.760]   I hope to do so before you leave here this evening.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.160]   The second authority is my own experience.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.620]   I've been a slave to this sin, okay?
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.740]   That's what you need to know.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.000]   If we don't know each other,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.120]   I've been a slave to pornography, sexual addiction.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.920]   I have sat in that prison.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.400]   I hope to turn the light on
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.560]   so that you can see the cell walls,
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.220]   'cause I've lived in it.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.660]   I've seen the cost firsthand.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.800]   The third authority is all of you.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.100]   For the last 11 years, over a decade,
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.760]   I've met with thousands of you,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.840]   literally thousands of you,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   that have fallen victim to the enemy's tactics
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.440]   as it relates to lust.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.200]   I've seen those who've done it well
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400]   and those who've done it poorly.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.520]   I've seen those who win and those who lose.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.600]   I've seen the likes of dozens and dozens,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.400]   maybe hundreds of marriages.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.160]   I know who is successful and who's not.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.960]   So many obvious patterns.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.760]   You think you're going to escape the odds.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   You think you're going to live outside of God's law,
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.960]   his commands for your life, and get away with it,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.880]   and you will not.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.640]   You won't.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.520]   You will not be the first person
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.020]   in the history of history to do that.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.360]   So I beg you to heed his warning this evening.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.160]   And the fourth authority is just the current of our culture.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.920]   What's going on in around us, the trends.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.660]   If I was to have everyone stand up, and I won't,
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.920]   I don't want to embarrass anyone.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.760]   The heart tonight is not to shame anyone,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.800]   but if I said, "Hey, everyone stand up and sit down.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.060]   "If you've had sex with less than eight people,
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.720]   "the majority of you would still be standing."
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.560]   I know that.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   I understand the problem that I'm speaking to this evening.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.840]   If I said, "Hey, everyone stand,"
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.000]   I said, "Hey, sit down.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.560]   "If you have an STD or you've had an STD,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.100]   "you or someone beside you would sit down.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.440]   "About one in three here this evening."
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:30.680]   If you, if I asked, you know,
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.240]   have you ever been sexually assaulted
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.960]   before this message is over?
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.600]   Maybe 40 or 50 times.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.880]   Every 90, or way more than that, I'm sorry, my math is off.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.380]   Every 98 seconds in America.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:54.400]   Every 98 seconds that comes from RAIN.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.080]   40 million Americans are sexually involved
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.920]   with the internet.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.700]   That's such a weird sentence to read.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.960]   40 million Americans are having sex with the internet.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.200]   Eight out of 10, that's 80% of men between the ages of 18
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.740]   and 30 view pornography at least monthly.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:21.040]   13 million American women click on pornography sites
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:21.880]   each month.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.640]   I know it's not just a men's problem.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.480]   I know that.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.700]   I know it's not.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.160]   One in three viewers of pornography are women.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   It's a huge issue, and it's hurting you,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.440]   and it's killing your dreams.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.840]   I hope to turn the light on.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.260]   In the same way, if you walked into a room,
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.920]   and there's a baby in the corner,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.800]   and he's playing or she's playing with a rattle,
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.800]   some sort of baby toy, and then you turn the lights on
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.620]   to find out it's a rattlesnake.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.560]   That's what this is doing.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.600]   That's what this is like.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.400]   This thing that we're playing with, that we've embraced,
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.300]   that we've called normal, it's killing you.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.140]   It's killing your marriage long before you have a prospect.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.500]   It's killing your intimacy with God.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:11.540]   It's causing you to be depressed, increasing your anxiety.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:17.940]   It's messed up your view of relationships.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.680]   You have no idea what you're doing.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.740]   Oh, while the enemy's entertained by you,
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.380]   you're gonna be entertained by me.
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.180]   I'm gonna start in 1 Thessalonians 4.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.780]   If you think DFW or even America
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.700]   is a sexually charged culture,
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.340]   I would just tell you we have nothing on Thessalonica,
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.940]   and so Paul is writing this letter to the Thessalonians,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.180]   and it is normal.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.340]   There's no moral law here.
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.740]   You can have children, prostitutes, molestation.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.020]   Rape is completely fine.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.380]   There's no government going to come after you.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.020]   Some of this is even encouraged.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.300]   It happens in church.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.100]   There's prostitution and temple worship
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.660]   through prostitution that is going on in this culture,
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.820]   and so they're worse off than we are today in 2018,
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.460]   and so he's going to write this letter
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.680]   to address these things, and he says this,
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.060]   and the reason I'm reading this to you up front
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.820]   is because it displays the dichotomy
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.500]   of lust and self-control.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.660]   So I'm gonna start here,
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.100]   and then we'll dive into the points.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.940]   It says this in verse three.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.940]   It is God's will that you should be sanctified.
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.180]   That's a churchy word.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.540]   It means becoming more dedicated to God.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.460]   It's God's will.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.940]   You wanna know what God's will is for your life?
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.740]   That you would become more like Christ.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.060]   It's God's will that you would be sanctified.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.220]   Here's how you do that.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.700]   That you should avoid sexual immorality.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.220]   That's the Greek word pornia.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.020]   It's where we literally get the word pornography
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.660]   from this Greek word right here,
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.860]   that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.260]   that each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.740]   in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.140]   not in passionate lust like the pagans
[00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.780]   who do not know God.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.420]   There's people who don't know God.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.620]   See also me at that club and that girl
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.340]   at the beginning of tonight.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.380]   I didn't know God.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.220]   What was I doing?
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.820]   Exactly what I should have been doing,
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.540]   'cause I didn't know God.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.780]   Why didn't I leave with her?
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.820]   Only common grace.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.400]   I have no idea, no right explanation.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.140]   But the Lord in his mercy
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.060]   protected me from further foolishness.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   And that in this matter,
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.740]   no one should wrong or take advantage
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.020]   of a brother or sister.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.900]   You don't say take another drink
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.300]   or please can I go a little further?
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.340]   It's called rape.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.780]   Be really careful.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.700]   No, no, let's just keep going.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.540]   Don't do that.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.600]   But not for that reason.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.260]   See the Lord will punish all those who commit such sins.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.140]   You see that?
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.020]   The Lord will punish those who commit such sins.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.900]   Fear the wrath of God.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.140]   As we told you and warned you before,
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.900]   for God did not call us to be impure,
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.900]   but to live a holy life.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.200]   Therefore, anyone who rejects this instruction
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.440]   does not reject a human being.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.980]   You're not rejecting me tonight,
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.660]   but God, the very God who gives you his Holy Spirit.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.100]   And that's the only way you're gonna win.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.460]   How are you gonna find victory?
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.940]   His Holy Spirit.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.960]   That's all you got.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.740]   What this text does is it sets up a dichotomy.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.780]   It shows you two tour guides.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.820]   There's two tour guides.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.220]   They both wanna take you on a tour.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.300]   Okay, one is your lust, your passionate lust.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.380]   One is self-control by the power of the Spirit.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.080]   This one is extremely attractive.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.700]   And he gives you exactly what your flesh desires.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.620]   And you look at him, you're like, man, I wanna follow you.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.160]   But he wants to take you and chain you up
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.960]   and beat you and abuse you and cut you
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.640]   and throw you off a cliff.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.680]   And this one over here,
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.480]   through the lens of the world, not so attractive.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.820]   This one almost appears boring.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.820]   It's kind of like your mom saying,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.320]   eat all your vegetables, you know?
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.000]   It's like, eh, I don't know, it's good for you.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.200]   And you're like, I'm just gonna follow you.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.340]   And the path is, it's not very worn.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.400]   Not many people have followed this tour guide.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.720]   But the second you start to follow him,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   he pushes back
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:31.440]   the trees into an open pasture with a flowing stream
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.720]   and a beautiful beach nearby and animals of bright colors
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.900]   and beautiful paradise he offers you.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.840]   He says, delight.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.360]   Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.380]   The dichotomy in this text, I'll show you.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.060]   Under self-control, we see God's will.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.140]   We see sanctified, that's becoming more dedicated to God.
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.080]   We see that we are able to control our body.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.740]   We see that we're holy, honorable.
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.460]   This is where the tour guide leads.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.620]   A life that is holy.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.340]   We can be with God, by the Holy Spirit,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.780]   with the Holy Spirit, with us at all times.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.420]   And the other tour guide takes us to sexual immorality,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.080]   passionate lust, straight from the text, pagans.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.520]   That's unbelievers, people that don't know God.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.760]   We take advantage of people, we'll be punished.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.120]   It's called the sin.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.640]   It's an impure life.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.200]   It's for those who reject instruction.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.500]   Choose your path, friends.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.320]   Choose your path.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.920]   Just choose wisely.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.720]   Let's talk about what causes lust
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.840]   as we dive into this.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840]   We're gonna look at the cause of lust,
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.760]   the cost of lust, and the cure for lust.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.560]   And before I dive into these points,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.800]   I want you to know you will control your sexual desires
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.640]   or you will be controlled by them.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.080]   You control your sexual desires
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.720]   or you will be controlled by them.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.640]   Now, what we have to do up front
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.880]   is you have to self-identify, not publicly,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.100]   but in your mind, you just need to know right now,
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.900]   hey, is this message for me?
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.000]   Do I struggle with this?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.480]   Okay, and so let's just ask a few questions.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.440]   As you think through pornography,
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.560]   have you seen it in the past six months?
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.520]   Have you pursued it?
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.080]   And I don't just mean porn of the traditional sense
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.880]   as an Instagram, hashtag chasing, social media.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.200]   Have you looked at something?
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.520]   Have you masturbated in the past six months?
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.440]   Is that something that you've taken part of?
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.920]   Have you been sexually involved with someone
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.960]   in the past six months?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.560]   Has you gone further than you were supposed to?
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.440]   Has your body, has you hung out with them,
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.480]   began to prepare itself for sex?
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.680]   I got a message for you.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.740]   I'm glad you're here.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.760]   Lord in His sovereignty, He's got something for you.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.040]   Let's talk about the cause of lust.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.000]   By defying it from the internet,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.840]   it's a very strong sexual desire for someone.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.640]   A very strong sexual desire for someone.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.640]   Hey, I have a prediction that someone
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.080]   will soon be changed to something, okay,
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.720]   because our culture is getting more and more perverted.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.640]   Soon, my prediction, it will be a very strong
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.440]   sexual desire for something.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.400]   And so we're gonna talk about what this looks like
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.240]   in your life.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.280]   It's four activities.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.200]   Four activities, I think, that lust looks like for you.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.740]   The first one is sexual thoughts and fantasy.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.920]   Sexual thoughts and fantasy.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.680]   You beginning to think through things
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.520]   as you drive down the road, just feeding thoughts.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.880]   Hey, here's what I would do with her.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.000]   Here's what I would do with him.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.280]   Or man, did I see his six pack as he was playing volleyball
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.480]   and you're just feeding those thoughts.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.420]   And man, what would it be like to be with that,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.120]   watching the romantic comedy and just thinking,
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.960]   hey, I want something like that, feeding those thoughts.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.840]   And then the second one is sexual acts
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.600]   outside of God's design for marriage.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.000]   And this is sex of any kind.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It's oral sex, anal sex, vaginal sex, sexting, masturbation.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.020]   It can be any sort of sexual activity
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.580]   outside of God's design for marriage, lust.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.980]   The third one is pornography.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.800]   Instagram, Snapchat, hashtag chasing, porn sites,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   movies, 50 Shades Freed, apps, virtual reality.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.200]   It's where we're headed.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.280]   Some of you have already been there.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.520]   You've already drank from that muddy pond.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.440]   Sorry.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.520]   So sorry.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.520]   The fourth one is masturbation.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.760]   This is what you do with pornography or the sexual thoughts.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.300]   It's sex by yourself.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.560]   It's sex with yourself.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.200]   It's sex with someone of the same sex, namely you.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.720]   That's what this is.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.080]   I'm not trying to shame you, but I gotta shed a light on it.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.900]   And this is the cyclical cycle that we get into
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.480]   because you feed the thoughts,
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.080]   which is going to take you somewhere,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.820]   always going to take you somewhere.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.900]   You're gonna look at something, see something,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.240]   then you act out on it.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.520]   No one looks at porn and doesn't masturbate.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.260]   Doesn't happen, right?
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.080]   You look at that to find and experience that release.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.680]   That's what you're doing
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.420]   so that you can experience sexual release,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.720]   so that you can find that high yet again,
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.600]   cope with another thing yet again.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.700]   And we just get stuck in this cycle.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.720]   The more we act out, the more we think about those things,
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.200]   the more we think about those things,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.320]   the more we pursue them, and the more we pursue them,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.780]   the more we act out on them.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.340]   You think, how do I become a sexual pervert?
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:39.700]   Weinstein, Louis C.K., or whoever comes to mind
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.680]   when I say that I was a sexual pervert.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.300]   How do you become one?
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.540]   One step at a time.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.860]   One click at a time.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.100]   One text at a time.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.860]   One site at a time.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.340]   One app at a time.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.140]   And as we feed our lust, guess what happens?
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.260]   The appetite grows.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:14.160]   Every time, every time you feed something, it grows.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.300]   It gets bigger.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.260]   That's the way that it works.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.340]   This is the lie of one last time.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.320]   I'm gonna call him one last time.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.380]   We're gonna get together one last time.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.500]   I'm gonna watch that one last time.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.380]   I'm gonna go there one last time.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.860]   No, you're not, because you just fed something
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.260]   and it got bigger.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.420]   And so next time, it's gonna be more difficult.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.160]   I'm gonna masturbate one last time.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.740]   How many times have you said that?
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.820]   No, you're not.
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.100]   No, you're not.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.000]   You know what you could say right now?
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.940]   The last times behind you?
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.980]   Man, take a deep breath.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.780]   Everybody take a deep breath for me.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.780]   Last times behind you.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.540]   One more time.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:08.780]   You don't have to do it anymore.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.560]   You don't have to look at that anymore.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.540]   You don't have to go there anymore.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.780]   You can stop killing yourself.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.540]   You can stop killing your marriage.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.460]   You can stop killing love.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.900]   So what is lust?
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.180]   The reality is you were born with a God-given desire.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.060]   And it happens when you go through adolescence.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.060]   You start to desire the opposite sex.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.540]   You start to think about them
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.620]   and you notice them different.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.700]   And if you were abused as a child,
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.900]   this can be different for you.
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.460]   And I would encourage you to seek help.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.760]   We're here for you.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.600]   We're helping.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.440]   We would love to help you
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.140]   like we have hundreds and hundreds of others.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.400]   But the reason that this happens around that time
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.920]   is because your body is able to make life.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.780]   It's a pretty amazing thing
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.740]   that when a man and a woman come together,
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.560]   they can create another human being.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.020]   This is God's genius design.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.860]   And so this desire that's been inside of us,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.980]   it's like a flame.
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.740]   It says in 1 Corinthians 7, 9,
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.120]   "But if they cannot control themselves,
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.960]   "they should marry.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.660]   "For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.060]   It describes that passion as a burning.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.340]   I'll think of it like a candle,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.960]   like a unity candle that everyone is born with
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.180]   or it shows up when you go through adolescence,
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.180]   a flame, some sort of burning, some sort of desire.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.100]   But you can imagine what happens
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.040]   when you begin to look at pornography,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.100]   when you begin to masturbate.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.680]   It's like pouring kerosene on that flame.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.240]   It turns into a dysfunctional, unruly bonfire
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.220]   that is going to burn everything that it touches.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.180]   And so the cause of lust is you feeding
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.300]   your fleshly desires.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.620]   Let's talk about the cost of lust,
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.720]   why it's so dangerous, the cost of lust.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.540]   Again, the cost, you're burning every relationship
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.820]   that you get in.
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.100]   Let's take a look at those same four categories if we can.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.540]   The first one, sexual thoughts and fantasy.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.580]   Feeding these thoughts only cause the desires to grow,
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.020]   right, and so you're making it more difficult
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.180]   for yourself, I've said it before,
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.260]   it's like shopping with no money.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.420]   You either leave frustrated or you take something
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.660]   that didn't belong to you.
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.260]   Those thoughts, you have to act out on them.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.100]   You'll just get frustrated.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.280]   And what happens is you just become
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.220]   like you feel dysfunctional.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.500]   And so you ride an elevator with someone of the opposite sex
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.220]   and you start wondering what's beneath their clothes.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.260]   You start wondering what his abs look like
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.300]   or you start wondering, your mind goes,
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.460]   you wonder, does her bra match her panties?
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   These are the thoughts and then you go back to your desk
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.020]   and those thoughts are still spinning
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.240]   and you feel like you can't work and you're distracted.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.460]   What are those thoughts gonna do for you?
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.380]   How are they gonna help you?
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.900]   You feel dysfunctional.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.460]   The second one, sexual acts outside of God's design
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.300]   for marriage.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:18.260]   Well, you know what happens, see, God designed sex
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.740]   for children and so what happens when a man and a woman
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.560]   have sex is she gets pregnant.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.280]   And so there's 700,000 abortions a year.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.940]   These are lives ended because of lust.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.140]   That someone's lust literally cost a life.
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.300]   Let your mind get around that.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.380]   A human being's not here.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.740]   Listen, I know that's many of you,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.860]   grace to you, we love you, we're glad you're here.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.240]   I'm not mad at you.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.540]   If you've trusted in Christ, God's not mad at you.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.860]   For the sake of those around you, tell your story.
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.540]   Stop thinking you're gonna take that to your grave.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.940]   That's a foolish plan.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.580]   Receive grace and forgiveness and tell others
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.900]   so they can step into the freedom.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.900]   Guys, I know this is part of your deal too.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.380]   Some of you funded it.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.140]   Tell your story, find healing.
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.620]   Stop staying in that prison.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.900]   Kids are being born into a single parent home.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:32.700]   40% of children now born to unmarried women
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.060]   comes from the CDC.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.860]   We talk about STDs, here's the deal,
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.860]   for years and years and years,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.620]   STDs have been on the decline until our watch,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.740]   until millennials showed back up on the scene
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.980]   and now chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis,
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.540]   they're back with a vengeance.
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.940]   And the vast majority, the number one perpetrator
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.180]   is millennials, that's us.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.620]   35% of Americans who have herpes do not know it.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.740]   35% don't know they have it.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.100]   One in five people who are living with HIV
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.620]   have not yet been diagnosed, meaning they don't know it yet.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.660]   75% of women living with chlamydia don't yet know it.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.660]   75% don't know it yet.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.480]   Talk about how it's emotionally compromising.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.160]   What we do is we train our bodies not to bond to someone.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.740]   See, we're addicted to variety.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.140]   So we'll never be satisfied by monogamy.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.100]   You don't understand the dangers of having sex with her,
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.500]   and her, and her, and her, and her click, her click,
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.780]   her click, her click, again, returning to that website.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.580]   You are retraining God's design.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.060]   You'll never, ever, ever be satisfied in a marriage.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.700]   You don't understand how dangerous
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.760]   this rattlesnake you're holding is.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:29:03.500]   You and I, the porn addict, is going to a university,
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.260]   meaning you're being trained over and over,
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.980]   you're being taught to use people for pleasure.
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.340]   And I've heard it said very well,
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.140]   and I love this 'cause this is so experiencely true,
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.500]   if you sneak over the fence to steal the fruit,
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.500]   it doesn't taste as good when you go through the front gate.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:28.400]   You don't want the real thing, you want the counterfeit.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.160]   You don't want filet mignon, you want dog food.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.760]   You've trained yourself to eat dog food.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.220]   And so when the filet is sitting on the table,
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.620]   you want the alpo, that's what your taste buds
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.880]   have been trained for.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.700]   How sad.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.980]   Pornography, the third category,
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.920]   what does it create?
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.100]   The cost of pornography, it creates sexual dysfunction,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:59.700]   both, think about the two ends of the spectrum.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.160]   You have erectile dysfunction,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   and then you have premature ejaculation.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.980]   Because you're trying to do it as fast as you can,
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:09.840]   over and over, by yourself.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.940]   So porn is gonna make you an awful lover.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.560]   An awful lover, it's a selfish act.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.760]   So when you come together with someone
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.580]   under the context of marriage,
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.480]   and you're supposed to love them selflessly,
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.620]   you have no idea how to do that.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:30.420]   You've been learning the other way.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:32.560]   I've gotta tell you, I say every time
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.680]   I tackle this message, I share the same story.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.080]   You've gotta understand God's design.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.840]   This is genius design.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.840]   That God created our bodies to function the way they do.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.120]   He made the parts, he loves sex, it's his idea,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.920]   he invented it, it's a fantastic idea,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.480]   an amazing invention.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.600]   Whenever you experience orgasm,
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.620]   you experience the highest levels of oxytocin
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.920]   that your brain can naturally produce.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.800]   The highest levels of dopamine
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.600]   that can be produced naturally.
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.520]   These are the feel-good hormones,
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.480]   the feel-good natural drugs in your body.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.960]   And so sex is the most pleasure,
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.240]   orgasm is the most pleasure
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.040]   that you can experience naturally.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.800]   And so what it does is when you experience that act,
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.760]   your brain creates synapses.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.320]   Synapses are like muscles.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.280]   Those muscles bond your five senses to your surroundings.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.420]   Listen closely.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.180]   So that whenever you experience an orgasm,
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.180]   the smell, the visual, the feeling,
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.660]   your body is very literally bonding to something.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.080]   Psychiatrists call it sex glue today.
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.700]   Now you can imagine what happens
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.300]   when you introduce pornography.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.340]   You get addicted to variety
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.700]   or you train yourself systematically
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.980]   not to bond to anything.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.980]   A case study in this, this is in a psychological journal,
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.020]   a famous case study is about the boots.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:07.980]   It's the boot story.
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.820]   And so a boy in adolescence comes downstairs
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.340]   and he had masturbated upstairs.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.180]   His dad heard him.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.060]   He comes down to breakfast.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.260]   His dad makes fun of him.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.380]   Parenting no-no.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.060]   But for the rest of his adolescence,
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.380]   the boy would put on his boots
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.860]   and go into the pasture, into the backyard.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.220]   And that's where he would masturbate
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.580]   for the rest of his adolescence.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:27.420]   He didn't know where to look.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.740]   He'd look down at his boots.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.260]   To this day, now an adult,
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.340]   he cannot have sex without his boots on.
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.540]   Why?
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.100]   His brain bonded to his boots.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.860]   There's another case study of someone
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.260]   who is sexually attracted,
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.460]   finds sexual release with their car,
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.900]   an inanimate object.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.740]   Why?
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.560]   Because they bonded to it.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.780]   There's thousands of stories of people
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.360]   who cannot have sex without a porno on the TV
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.120]   or a magazine open on the bed.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.700]   This is what you're doing to yourself.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.620]   How long are you gonna do it to yourself?
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.940]   Will you lift up your head?
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.660]   Will you look backwards?
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.380]   Has it been since the fifth grade?
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.100]   Has it been that long?
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:16.540]   How long are you gonna do it to yourself, friends?
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.740]   Would you stop?
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.780]   The last time could be behind you.
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:26.660]   Could be behind you.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.800]   There's freedom in that.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:36.440]   Consider God's brilliant design.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.600]   When one man and one woman,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.520]   they have not really experienced anything sexually.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.120]   They come together on their wedding night.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.280]   It's really awkward and uncomfortable.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.120]   It hurts.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.040]   It's not really fun.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.320]   But they have an entire lifetime to experience.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.720]   They don't know what they're doing.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.640]   It's clumsy.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:02.100]   But they have an entire lifetime to figure it out together.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.340]   And as they continue to come together,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.280]   and he hasn't experienced that with anybody else,
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.400]   she remains the epitome of attraction for him,
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.980]   even when she becomes 50 and 60 years old
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:16.580]   and 70 years old and 80 years old,
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.340]   his brain continually bonding to her.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.780]   How beautiful is that?
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.640]   Is God not a genius?
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.720]   Do you see how we've perverted it?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.940]   The risk of pornography is sexual deviance.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:37.200]   This comes from a write-up, Neuropharmacology.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.620]   It says the brain's reward center
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.160]   doesn't know the difference between porn that's okay to use,
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.040]   which there's not, and porn that's not cool.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.500]   All it knows is that it likes dopamine.
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.660]   So when something sick or disturbing pops up
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.180]   and is linked with sexual arousal,
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.720]   the brain wires that into the user's sexual template.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.120]   The same part of the brain that is stimulated by porn
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   is the same part of the brain
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.400]   that is stimulated by horror movies.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.600]   When you see someone get their head cut off,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.220]   it's the same sort of sensation.
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.520]   Porn is an extremely slippery slope.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.120]   You can see the growing problem of child pornography.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.120]   You see how you start with just wanting to see someone naked
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.320]   and then wanting to see them in the act
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.000]   and then wanting to see multiple people of the same sex
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.560]   and then wanting to see bondage, S&M, animals.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.940]   I don't know, it's a slippery slope, y'all.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.480]   It takes you somewhere.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.320]   That's an abusive guide you're following.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.740]   He wants to kill you.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:48.240]   Think about the phenomenon of 50 Shades of Grey,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.280]   50 Shades Free now.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:55.280]   That sadomasochism is becoming a normal pursuit.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.540]   I can even say that with a clear conscience.
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.300]   Like, do you think that when God invented sex,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.080]   he was like, man, I hope they tie each other up
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.200]   and hurt each other.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.400]   Whips and candles and gags.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:18.360]   Don't you see how you're getting tricked?
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.280]   I mean, Satan's watching you and being entertained by you.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.280]   He's like, oh, look, they enjoy hurting each other.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.720]   They think it's love.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.480]   You are being fooled, man.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.680]   Would you wake up?
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.260]   You are being tricked.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.800]   It's not loving.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.480]   It's hurtful.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.800]   It's satanic.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:47.440]   2012 poll said that most porn users agreed
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.880]   with the statement, my taste became increasingly
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.000]   extreme and deviant.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.800]   Consider anal sex.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.200]   Researchers in England recently published a study
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.040]   where they looked at boys, heterosexual boys,
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.680]   16 to 18 year old, and they began to ask them questions.
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.900]   And they said that they had been trying,
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.500]   most or many of them said that they had been trying
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.220]   to convince their girlfriends to have anal sex
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.480]   even though they knew that it would hurt her.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   Where did we go?
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.080]   How did we get here?
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.120]   I think we're lost.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.520]   I think we lost our way, man.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:29.680]   They were asked why.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.620]   Why would you do that?
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.160]   Why would you want to do something harmful
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.920]   to your girlfriend?
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.420]   He said, because we saw it in porn.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.420]   Satan's having a heyday, man, watching us hurt each other.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.420]   Another side effect, symptom of porn,
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.740]   is you desire counterfeit.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.100]   See, these women, they have fake breasts.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.020]   The men are endowed differently than most men.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.100]   And this just creates insecurity.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.540]   See, she's not just comparing you to the eight men
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.100]   that she's been with.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.180]   She's comparing you with the hundreds of men
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.540]   that she's watched.
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.980]   And she's comparing you to the eight men
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:08.300]   that she's been with, the hundreds of men
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.340]   that she's watched.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.460]   And this is a terrifying thing for women,
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.820]   that you might be comparing her to your other partners
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.140]   or to the porn stars you look.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.360]   And some of you have bought the lie.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.180]   You want to look like a porn star.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.620]   You look at them and you want your body to look like that.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.460]   And you are just pursuing,
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.060]   you're not just pursuing the counterfeit.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.620]   You want to be the counterfeit.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.900]   One statistic said that in the near future,
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.940]   more people will be having sex with robots than humans.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.340]   You want to know where we're headed?
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.980]   I just told you where we're headed.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.180]   Jesus, come quickly.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.780]   Porn kills love as a movement.
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.420]   Comes from fightthenewdrug.org.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.420]   I'd encourage you to go there, fightthenewdrug.org.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.620]   Lastly, let's talk about masturbation.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.860]   Masturbation teaches you selfishness, not sacrifice.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.820]   Masturbation makes you a terrible lover,
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.540]   as I said earlier.
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.500]   You get used to a particular feeling,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.380]   yourself, and you seek to finish as fast as possible.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.320]   It trains you toward premature ejaculation,
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.600]   premature orgasm.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.660]   And can you think of a marriage, hell,
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.020]   that you would be in a covenant relationship
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.060]   with someone of the opposite sex,
[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.420]   someone who loves God, someone beautiful,
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.220]   and yet you can't enjoy them
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.640]   because you'd rather seek pleasure by yourself.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.280]   And it happens all the time.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.920]   Like, I'm not talking crazy up here.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.080]   This is a serious issue.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.020]   It happens all the time.
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.000]   I want you to know, man, there is hope.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.040]   There is hope.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.280]   I can remember being in a small group
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.720]   after I became a believer,
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.280]   and we were going around sharing,
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.760]   and one guy said, "Hey, I just want to give you guys
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.440]   "some encouragement."
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.240]   Don't we need some encouragement in this message
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.080]   right about now?
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   We need some encouragement.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.280]   Let me give you some encouragement.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.360]   He said, "Hey, guys, it's my anniversary."
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.720]   Anniversary, what are you talking about?
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.040]   You're not even in a relationship.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.520]   Said, "Yeah, it's been three years since I masturbated."
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.660]   And I was a new believer, and I was like, three years?
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.480]   Is that even possible?
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.400]   You didn't die?
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.440]   You're still with that?
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.960]   You went three years?
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.860]   I didn't even know that could be done.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.280]   And it can be done.
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.500]   That's what I want you to know.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.360]   Now I've been following Christ for a while,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.740]   and I have experienced personal, incredible freedom.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.280]   And if you feel hopeless, and I've taught this enough
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.640]   to know that many of you right about now
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.300]   feel really, really hopeless.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.400]   I tell you something, I found freedom,
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.760]   a freedom that I didn't think was possible.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.560]   If you think that the solution was marriage,
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.400]   let me tell you something,
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.880]   it only gets a whole lot worse in marriage.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.920]   It only, all of those desires and all of those problems
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.200]   only grow in marriage.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.360]   You need to know that.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.240]   I need you to take my word for it,
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.960]   or hundreds of other people I could have you talk to.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.440]   And so this is what it's like, I read this this week,
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.640]   and this is what lust is like.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.180]   And so stranded sailors, sailors that have been capsized
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:19.640]   in the ocean, the problem is they're out there,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.680]   the sun is scorching them,
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.600]   you've seen this in the movie "Unbroken"
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.880]   with Louie Zamberini, they're out there,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.840]   and they're so thirsty.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.640]   But the irony is they're surrounded by water.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.900]   And this is the biggest problem
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.180]   for those who have been shipwrecked.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.720]   The number two cause of death is drinking salt water,
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.600]   because when you drink it, the more you drink,
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.760]   the more you crave it, all it's doing is poisoning you.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   Your body can't, your kidneys can't process salt water.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.400]   And so you're sitting out there in the middle of the ocean,
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.120]   surrounded by water, drowned, I mean, dying of thirst.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.040]   And in the same way, you are surrounded,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.000]   you have a flame, you have a desire,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.080]   and you're surrounded in a sexually charged culture.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.540]   You can find nudity and sex of all kind at any given time,
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:14.760]   but do not drink, it's poisonous.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.720]   And the more you drink, the more you want,
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.780]   and the more you die.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.640]   It's a cruel cycle.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:29.280]   And so what do we do, how do we find healing from this?
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.240]   The cost of lust is life and love.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.160]   The cost of lust is life and love.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.800]   And so let's talk about the cure for lust as we leave.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.600]   The cure for lust, the cure for lust,
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.360]   I'll give it to you up front, it's self-control.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.200]   It's learning self-control.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.940]   And so here's what I want you to think about,
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:48.600]   like you're flatlined, like you're out there,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.280]   and you need CPR, okay?
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.840]   Like you're dead, the screen just went blank,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.640]   and they want the light to come back on.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.680]   They want that heartbeat to come, beep, beep.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.040]   They want it to come back on, so you need CPR.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.880]   That's the acronym I'm about to give you,
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.040]   CPR, CPR, two times, CPR, CPR.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.320]   The first C is for confess, the word confess.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.560]   Confess at the thought level every time, write this down.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.040]   Confess, confess at the thought level.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.880]   When do you confess?
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.320]   When you think it, not when you act out on it,
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.160]   not when you do something, you confess then too,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.960]   but confess at the thought level.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:29.320]   You say, JP, I'll be confessing 20, 30, 40, 60 times a day.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.520]   Confess 1,000 times a day.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.280]   Wear out your community group.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.640]   Oh yeah, community group, you're gonna need that too.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.920]   You need people in this fight with you,
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.520]   other brothers and sisters who know you and love God
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:44.920]   and love you and know God, who are up for the battle.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.760]   And you start to confess at the thought level.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.440]   That is when you confess.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.480]   And don't just, and let me just give you
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.620]   a scripture to go with that.
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.800]   It's James 5, 16.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.320]   Therefore, confess your sins to each other
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.200]   and pray for each other so that you may be healed.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.640]   The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.040]   And so the second thing you do is you pray.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.280]   Never have someone confess something to you
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.180]   and not immediately pray for them.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.540]   That's the formula God gave us through James.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.440]   When they confess, you pray.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.940]   That's where healing comes from.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:20.740]   They confess, you pray.
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.620]   And so you pray for them every single time.
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.400]   And you and I, we need to pray honest prayers.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.680]   This is when I experienced freedom myself
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.840]   is I would wake up in the morning and say,
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:35.760]   God, I don't want to lust after a woman today.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.580]   God, I don't wanna go back like a dog to his vomit
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.360]   to those websites today.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.600]   God, would you strengthen me?
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.960]   Holy Spirit, would you help me to take my thoughts captive?
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.720]   When I think about her, help me to pray,
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.840]   help me to shift, help me to think about you.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.720]   And you wage war and it's gonna be a battle, man.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.180]   It is not for the faint at heart.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.140]   It's not for little boys and not for little girls.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.500]   It is an all out war for warriors and soldiers.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   And you gotta be up for the fight
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.620]   'cause there's some sleepless nights ahead of you.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:11.860]   You wake up at 2 a.m.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.260]   You don't know what to do.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.100]   You fight.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.740]   You're saying I don't sleep that night?
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.340]   Maybe not.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.340]   You fight like you're at war.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.740]   And the enemy's coming in through the window.
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.100]   You fight.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.540]   Confess, pray, R is for repent.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.700]   Repent is to turn.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.780]   That's what the word means.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.900]   You change the goal.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.060]   Like my little girl when she's playing basketball
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.460]   and she gets the rebound and she starts going the wrong way
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.300]   'cause they change goals at halftime.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.580]   I'm her dad, I'm the silent.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.860]   I say, hey, you're going the wrong way.
[00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.780]   Go that way, go that way, go that way.
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.740]   And at some point she listens and she changes the goal.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.820]   You change the goal.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.300]   You turn from the desire for immediate gratification,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.380]   the desire for immediate pleasure, you change the goal.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.680]   You're gonna go without immediate pleasure.
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.760]   That's what you need to know.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.940]   That's what's gonna happen.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.580]   You're no longer gonna gratify that.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:07.180]   Change the goal.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.780]   The second C is for Christ.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.300]   As you turn from your sin, you turn toward Jesus.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.500]   John Piper said, I know no other way to overcome sin
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.740]   than to find a superior satisfaction in Jesus.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.460]   What do I mean by pursuing Jesus?
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.500]   Look, I'm looking out here, I see a bunch of gifted people.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.020]   I see a bunch of young adults that God wants to use.
[00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.260]   Fill your life with the things of God.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.380]   I'm talking Bible studies, community groups.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.840]   Maybe you go back to seminary, okay?
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.080]   You start to read and study the Bible every day.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:41.300]   Write some songs, worship him every day.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.740]   You join a church if you're not.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.100]   Obvious, join a church
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.500]   that you would get into a small group there.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:52.780]   You fill your life with the things of God.
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.020]   Turn on Christian radio.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.260]   Start to read Christian books.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.900]   Fill your life with the things of Christ.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.600]   Get some accountability in the way that,
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.180]   like I don't like to work out,
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.420]   but if I know that somebody's gonna meet me up there,
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.380]   I'm gonna be up there.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.340]   And so you get some accountability around you.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.740]   You pursue Christ.
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.180]   This is when I knew that I was gonna be okay.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:20.060]   I was growing in my relationship with Jesus.
[00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.880]   There was a billboard that I would see every day
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.860]   on the way home on 635.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.580]   It was a woman in a bikini.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.140]   And every day I'd look at that billboard and I'd lust.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.620]   And one day I'm growing in my relationship with Christ
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.740]   and I'm talking to him and I'm praying in the car
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.660]   out loud as I drive.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.180]   It's what I do, radio off, I'm praying out loud.
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.580]   And I know that billboard's coming
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.540]   because I see it every single day and I'm approaching her.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.600]   She's beautiful.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.460]   And on this particular day I'm like, it's not worth it.
[00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.860]   It's not worth this.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.380]   It's not worth intimacy with Christ.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.980]   I'm not gonna look at it.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.700]   And in that moment, it was the first glimmer of hope I had.
[00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.740]   See, I thought I'd struggle with porn and masturbation
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.620]   until I died.
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.240]   And in that moment I knew I was gonna be okay.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.380]   I knew that the Lord was gonna heal me.
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:06.840]   The next P is for pursue, pursue marriage.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.980]   Pursue becoming someone, the one you're looking for
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.440]   or is looking for, we've said before.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.360]   Pursue marriage.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.220]   What I mean by pursue marriage is not go into marriage
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.120]   with a porn struggle.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.660]   I mean find freedom so that you can get married
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.120]   if you want marriage.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.360]   If you want to experience sexual intimacy,
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.240]   that's your outlet.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.040]   And so you begin to prepare yourself for marriage.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.500]   I get asked all the time, what do I do
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.280]   if my boyfriend's looking at porn?
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.880]   What do I do if my girlfriend's looking at porn?
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.720]   You ready?
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.960]   That's where I make some enemies.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.800]   You break up.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.480]   You break up, you look them in the eyes.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.720]   You say, you know what, I love you too much
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   to stay in this relationship.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.080]   I want you to find freedom.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.960]   Maybe you wait for them, maybe you don't.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.160]   That's your prerogative.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.320]   But you point them in the direction of healing.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.220]   You say, hey, I don't want to be a stumbling block
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.420]   for you getting well.
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:59.160]   And so pursue marriage.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.440]   And the last R is you remove access.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.480]   You remove access.
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.720]   This, in my opinion, is how I know
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.680]   after a decade of doing this,
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   if someone's gonna get well or not.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:12.960]   If they're willing to remove access.
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.080]   Like how do you look at porn?
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.800]   My cell phone, you get rid of your cell phone.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.640]   How do you look at porn?
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.960]   My laptop, you get rid of your laptop.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:19.840]   I'd have to quit my job.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.560]   You change your jobs.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.680]   You willing to change your job?
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.520]   Let's play that game.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.800]   What are you willing to do to be free?
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.260]   You remove access.
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.960]   You audit, how do I look at porn?
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.640]   You say, well, I can always do this.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.320]   Listen, absolutely, man.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.920]   But make it difficult for yourself.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.800]   Then you say, man, isn't that legalism?
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.440]   Let me show you the words of Jesus.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.720]   He said in Matthew 5,
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.640]   "You have heard it was said,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.980]   "you shall not commit adultery.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.160]   "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.940]   "has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.280]   "If your right eye causes you to stumble,
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.060]   "gouge it out, throw it away.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.380]   "It is better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.400]   "than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.560]   "And if your right hand,"
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.560]   interesting that he goes hand there.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.940]   I'll let you think about that.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.280]   And if your right hand causes you to stumble,
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:08.900]   cut it off and throw it away.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.460]   It is better for you to lose one part of your body
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.300]   than for your whole body to go into hell.
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.620]   And so he's saying, hey, this guy that you wanna follow
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:20.180]   seeks to take you all the way to hell.
[00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.500]   Am I saying that you can lose your salvation?
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.100]   No, I'm saying that the Holy Spirit
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.380]   does not allow Christ followers
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:32.180]   to be given over to sexual immorality for their life.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.580]   That the Holy Spirit seeks to rescue you.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.120]   Will you respond to him?
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.900]   And if you do not respond to him,
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.120]   if you close your heart to the Holy Spirit,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.420]   why would you assume that you know Jesus?
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:52.940]   These are the words of Jesus, and so get help.
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.380]   In this room on Monday at 6.30,
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.700]   for those of you in Dallas,
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.060]   those who are listening, find a celebrate recovery
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.840]   or a regeneration in your town.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.700]   In this room, Monday nights at 6.30,
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.380]   you walk in and there'll be thousands of other people
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.020]   who are seeking to get help.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.100]   You, listen, if you've looked at porn
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.340]   in the past six months, don't come to the porch
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.220]   next Tuesday, come to Regent on Monday.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.060]   I'd rather you go there.
[00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.340]   I wanna see you well.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:24.420]   6.30, Monday night.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.300]   And so the cause of lust
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.940]   is you feeding your fleshly desires.
[00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.620]   The cost of lust is life and love.
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:36.400]   And the cure for lust is allowing the Holy Spirit
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.160]   to give you CPR, that you confess, pray, repent,
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.760]   seek Christ, pursue, and remove.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.940]   CPR, CPR.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:50.240]   I think the goal for so many of us is marriage.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   You wanna get married.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.720]   But the reality is you're gonna get into a marriage
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.960]   and you don't understand that you're thinking
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.560]   that marriage is your opportunity
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.440]   to try all this crazy stuff,
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.780]   the stuff that you've seen.
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.440]   And so then you've got two options.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.500]   You can marry someone who's tried all kinds of crazy stuff
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.400]   and they're ready for that.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   Or you can marry someone who's really, really intimidated
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.260]   by the fact that you wanna try all kinds of crazy stuff
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.880]   and that doesn't go well for anybody.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.320]   And so you can think of an ideal would be,
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.120]   like I said, that two would come together,
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.360]   they don't know about the crazy stuff.
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.720]   They've set no evil before their eyes.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.920]   And you say, man, how do I get there though, JP?
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.120]   I'm so far past that, man, you don't understand.
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.800]   You start the undoing tonight
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   that the last time would be behind you.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.280]   You guys have been to weddings, right?
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.580]   Anybody been to a wedding?
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.480]   Still with me?
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.800]   I know it's long.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.740]   About to let you go home right now.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.360]   You been to a wedding?
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.120]   Okay, good, like three of you have been to a wedding.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:54.960]   That's awesome.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.600]   Sometimes they do this thing, like the unity candle, right?
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.520]   And so anybody seen the unity candle?
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:08.000]   And so it's like the, you know, there's these two candles
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.320]   and one represents the husband
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.240]   and one represents the wife.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.320]   But for the person who has looked at pornography, right,
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.640]   it's like that flame, that flame looks like that.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.380]   It's not like a normal flame.
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.480]   So I don't know if we can kill this light,
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:31.480]   but this flame, it's like a bigger flame.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:32.360]   I mean this light.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:35.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.400]   Thank you.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.040]   It's like you've poured kerosene
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.120]   and you're gonna go into marriage with that
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.200]   and you think, you know, I'm gonna go
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.440]   and light this candle over here,
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.840]   but you're not just burning your life down.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.280]   You understand that?
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.800]   Like it's not just your life that you've been burning down.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.320]   You're gonna burn her life down, his life down,
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.240]   your children's life down.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.480]   Like it's all gonna be melted away
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.620]   right in front of your eyes.
[00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.260]   Can I tell you something crazy?
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.380]   It's melting away right now.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.640]   You just don't know it, you don't understand it,
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.760]   you haven't seen it.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.080]   Can I tell you something crazier?
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.380]   God, he loves you so much.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.560]   He has you here.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.520]   He has you there.
[00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.380]   He has you listening.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:28.360]   That you would understand the instructions
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:33.360]   and not just watch a life melt away like that.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.740]   That he has a better plan for you.
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:40.840]   That when two become one,
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.280]   that it would be this beautiful expression of love
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.060]   by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.520]   That it'd be the beginning of the creation of a family.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.760]   That they'd have children and they'd raise them to know God,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.820]   the one true God.
[00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.920]   Such a beautiful thing.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.600]   Some of you women, you're hearing this and you're like,
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.000]   man, JP, you don't understand, I don't have an option.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.880]   Like I wanna get married but nobody's asking me out.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.820]   You should especially hate porn.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.840]   Not give into it, not take the shortcut.
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.340]   The reason is pornography.
[00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.600]   It's keeping you single.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.720]   Not just your struggle, their struggle.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.560]   You should especially hate it.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.680]   Some of you, you're really gifted.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   Like you might need to go into politics
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.920]   and write the government and do something
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.440]   to abolish pornography.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:32.920]   For the sake of children who are being,
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.200]   that thing's doing something crazy over here.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.400]   Insane.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:45.520]   You can just see, it's just melting away your life.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.480]   You worry about that lamp?
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.300]   I see you.
[00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:53.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.420]   That's all part of the illustration,
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.820]   like you catch yourself on it.
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:58.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.860]   It's melting away your life.
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.380]   There's no unity in that.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:08.700]   That's what's happening, that's what's been happening.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.300]   That's what you've been a part of.
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.100]   I'm gonna pray for us.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.980]   I'm gonna pray for you.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:20.420]   Some of you, you think I've been talking to you
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.980]   and it's because I've been talking to you.
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.300]   I hope the Holy Spirit's been talking to you.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.420]   What if the last time was behind you?
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:35.060]   What if the next time you experience
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:40.060]   any kind of sexual release that you prompted,
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.220]   you're on your honeymoon,
[00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:46.380]   with someone who loves Jesus more than you?
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:51.180]   And you know, it's not full of shame.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.500]   You're not wondering how many people
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:55.740]   they're comparing you to.
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.980]   You're not trying to perform.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:03.700]   You're just making beautiful love,
[00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.900]   an act of worship, it's an act of worship.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:08.620]   How awesome would that be?
[00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:11.980]   Father, would you make that true for my friends?
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.500]   Here in Dallas.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.380]   In Fort Worth.
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:29.780]   Houston, Tulsa, El Paso, South Africa,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.620]   wherever somebody's listening to God.
[00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:37.620]   Would you set them free?
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:43.100]   Father, I wanna thank you for the freedom
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.780]   that I've experienced personally.
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.980]   That you would allow me to take my mess
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   and make it a message, it's a privilege.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:58.900]   Father, would you do something powerful this evening?
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:01.820]   In the hearts of my friends,
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.980]   that some of them are here with their significant other,
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.820]   it's been so awkward this whole time,
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:11.300]   and there's gonna be some breakups in the parking lot.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.140]   Would you give them courage?
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:24.980]   Lord, some of them, they feel like you've forgotten them.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:29.060]   They wanna get married and they're just like, where?
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:30.780]   And like I've been saving myself
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:34.060]   and I've been pursuing purity and where is he, Lord?
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:36.860]   Would you help them to get out of the waiting room, God?
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:42.580]   And to set the focus on making much of you with their life.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.020]   Using their singleness.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:50.900]   And Father, I don't wanna end this prayer
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.340]   or this message or this evening
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.020]   without celebrating the gospel.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:58.220]   So I declared in this prayer that your son, Jesus Christ,
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:01.780]   has died for all our sins, past, present, and future.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.220]   He died for every time we've looked at pornography,
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:06.460]   every time we've masturbated,
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.260]   every time we've had sex of any kind, God.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.700]   Jesus died for that, he paid for it.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.140]   You aren't holding that against us.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.500]   Would you allow us to embrace that payment,
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.340]   to celebrate that freedom,
[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:22.980]   and to not continue to sin,
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:26.260]   but to live a life for you?
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:31.620]   In the name of Christ Jesus, amen.
[00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:41.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
