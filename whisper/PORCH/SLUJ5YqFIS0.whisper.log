[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   Man, welcome everyone in the room.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.640]   And I want to welcome our Porch Live locations
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.380]   that are not tuning in online, but are here.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.060]   'Cause all of them are, or at least have people
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.440]   from each of them, specifically Porch Live Boise,
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.660]   Scottsdale, Arizona, Indianapolis,
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.100]   Greater Lafayette, North Houston,
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.220]   Des Moines, Iowa, Cincinnati, Ohio,
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.060]   Tulsa, Oklahoma, Austin, Texas,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.980]   Midland, Texas, Fort Worth, Texas,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.100]   and of course, Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.820]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.740]   Hey, as you've already heard,
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.980]   this whole weekend is the theme of the rehearsal,
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.500]   that this life, according to the scriptures,
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.780]   is not the end.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.040]   As we know, as believers in Jesus,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.220]   it is a preparation for all of eternity.
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.540]   And the way that we live this life impacts our eternity
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.300]   and the eternity of others around us.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.020]   And so we just want to talk through what it looks like
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.340]   to live in light of that theme,
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.300]   and to be the people of God, and to live in light of that.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.500]   Let me start with a story that is relevant,
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260]   especially to anybody here,
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260]   or everybody here who's from California.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.980]   My family, about a month ago,
[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.220]   got a chance to go with my in-laws.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.820]   My wife's parents had invited us
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.140]   to go on a trip to California,
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.460]   and basically said, "If you can cover the flights
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.860]   "for you and the kids, we'll cover the house."
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.540]   So we were gonna go for a week, and it was in Malibu.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.040]   And I've never been to Malibu.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.300]   California people, you know it is a bougie experience,
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.740]   and it was a free place, and it's like,
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.260]   "Man, we're not gonna turn that down."
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.700]   And so I began to plan all the things that we should do,
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.460]   and I'm reaching out to friends, and calling people,
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.440]   and saying, "Hey, you've been there.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.460]   "Tell me what we should do.
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.540]   "Tell me what we need to see.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.220]   "Tell me the things that are not that great,
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.540]   "and everyone thinks you should, but you should avoid that."
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.060]   And I just began to plan and think through,
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.620]   how do we maximize our time there,
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.220]   and how do we prioritize?
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.660]   We're gonna go to the beach every single day,
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.660]   because there's things, you can go shopping in Dallas.
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.900]   You can't go to the beach in Dallas.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.380]   We're going to the beach every single day.
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.660]   How do we maximize just what's gonna be available?
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.100]   Dallas Cowboys were doing their training camp,
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.460]   so of course, it's like, "Man, we're gonna go load up,
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.260]   "drive, go see the Dallas Cowboys training camp."
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260]   And my focus throughout the trip,
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.020]   thank you, there you go, get a voice.
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.780]   My focus throughout the trip was really two things.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.900]   It was, man, how do we maximize my agenda,
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.540]   and things that would be fun for our family,
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.940]   and take advantage of this short time period
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.500]   that we have here, and if I'm being honest,
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.140]   kind of our own comfort, because you're on vacation, right?
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.700]   And so you wanna make sure that you get to sleep
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.620]   as long as possible, you're resting as long as possible.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.420]   And when you have little kids,
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.620]   that's a really challenging thing to do,
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.860]   in particular, if they're sleeping in the same room with you.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.700]   And they were, and I feel like I cracked the code
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.460]   on how to do this well, so this is free advice
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.620]   for a little bit down the road.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.980]   Whenever you have kids, and you travel,
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.380]   and they're staying in the same hotel,
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.020]   or you travel, and they're staying in the same room
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.340]   with you inside of the house,
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.060]   I feel like I've figured it out, okay?
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.100]   First day, we go, we sleep, and I'm like, man,
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.420]   just, you know, the problem is they go to bed earlier,
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.180]   and so any restful experience of you trying to get in bed,
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.580]   and go to bed, and turn on the light, and brush your teeth,
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.940]   it just immediately wakes them up,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.500]   and just ruins the whole thing.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.540]   So after one night of that, it hit me.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.060]   The Spirit of God spoke to me.
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.040]   And he said, no, I don't think this was the Spirit of God.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   I should go buy a tent.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.560]   I'm gonna buy a tent, and put it in the room,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.560]   and make it like a camping experience for them,
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.120]   and they'll love it, and we'll be able to, you know,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.500]   like, turn on the light, and brush our teeth,
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.080]   and have a merry time together, and it'll be great.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.280]   And so I went and bought a tent, that just set it up,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.960]   and hey, you guys are gonna get to hang out in this tent,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.640]   and they loved it, and we loved it, and it was just great.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.760]   That was one after one example of just like,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   how do we maximize and have just comfort here?
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.360]   How do we work in with the grandparents,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.960]   get a date night, make sure that we go,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.600]   and eat the best seafood, and just have an amazing time?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.240]   Now, what does that have to do with heaven and eternity?
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   Well, when you think about it, that idea of,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.160]   hey, I don't know how long we're gonna have here,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.920]   or we have a limited amount of time here,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.480]   I wanna focus on my agenda, doing, and accomplishing,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.960]   and having the experiences that I want,
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.520]   and my comfort is how a lot of us,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.160]   and a lot of people live life.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.300]   Hey, I don't know what all life has for me,
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.640]   but I hope it has, that I drive a certain car,
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.280]   I hope I make a certain amount of money,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.120]   I wanna build my business, and I wanna be successful,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080]   and I wanna have as much of my own agenda,
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.140]   and my experiences, and I wanna have the vacation,
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.160]   and Bora Bora, and check off the bucket list,
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.480]   and I wanna have all the different things
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.720]   that I want inside of my life,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.560]   and I wanna have my own comfort,
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.400]   that I wanna spend and devote my life,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.160]   and accomplish, and be successful enough,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   or marry the right person to have the type of comfort
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.740]   in life that I want,
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.500]   and where that becomes tragic is as Christians,
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.900]   the Bible teaches that if you devote your life
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.860]   to pursuing your own agenda,
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.580]   and your own comfort, at the exclusion of God's will,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.420]   you've wasted your life,
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.120]   and part of the reason is because as believers,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.460]   and I can't spend long here,
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.100]   but the Bible teaches that you and I
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.380]   are gonna spend eternity not in like fluffy clouds,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.340]   like those balloons out there for all of eternity,
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.980]   but on this earth, in Revelation chapter 21,
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.180]   it says God will create a new heavens, and a new earth,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.140]   he will renew the planet that we are on,
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.060]   so you don't have to worry about,
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.100]   man, I've never gone to Maui,
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.180]   I've gotta make sure that I do that before I die,
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.780]   you'll have all of eternity, billions of years,
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.100]   to go to an even better version of Maui,
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.340]   or whatever that's gonna look like,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.260]   you don't have to worry about backpacking through Europe
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.500]   before you reach some certain age,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.440]   because if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.320]   and I'm not saying that either of those are bad things,
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.060]   but you will have all of eternity,
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.660]   to experience a world, and a new creation,
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.660]   that God has made,
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.160]   and what I wanna attempt to do,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.240]   and really the whole weekend we wanna attempt to do,
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   is paint a vision for how do you live in light of eternity,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.680]   what does it look like to live this life,
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.040]   in light of the next,
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.400]   and let me just show my cards up front,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.160]   here's the challenge of this message,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.360]   and why it's not gonna break through to some of you,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.540]   because every message that you hear,
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.840]   every day, from friends, from family, from people,
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.280]   is that you should spend your life,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.540]   focusing on your agenda, and accomplishing things,
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.160]   and being successful in your own comfort,
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.880]   and that can come by way of subtle messages,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.720]   like honey, you gotta make sure
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.920]   that you save enough for retirement,
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.020]   as though the ultimate goal of life
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.640]   is being able to retire at some certain age,
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.020]   it can come like honey, you need to make sure
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.200]   that you have the right job, you get in the right career,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.520]   because you need to provide for yourself,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.400]   and every message that you're bombarded with,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.320]   is you should focus on you,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.640]   and the paradox of the Christian life,
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.880]   is that when you focus on you,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.320]   you end up wasting your life,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.720]   and as believers, we've been given certain invitations
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.680]   by God on how to steward the time,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.420]   and the life that we have, in light of eternity,
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.160]   and I wanna walk through three of those things,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.280]   from 1 Peter chapter four, so if you have a Bible,
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.720]   you can flip over to 1 Peter chapter four,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.760]   verses seven through 11,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.080]   if not, it'll be on the screens,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.760]   and if you don't have a Bible in general,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.840]   we have some at the Welcome Center,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.960]   which is right outside of these doors,
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.640]   we'd love to give you a Bible
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.440]   that you can pick up at any point throughout the weekend,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.920]   but in this passage, written by the Apostle Peter,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.220]   he's gonna speak directly to, in light of eternity,
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.840]   in light of the fact that this life is limited,
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.140]   how should we live, and he's gonna lay out three things,
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.960]   now, here's the background on Peter,
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.040]   Peter was the leader of the disciples,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.560]   Peter spent three years walking with Jesus,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.560]   Peter was the disciple who stood next to the empty tomb
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.280]   with the Apostle John,
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   he was a disciple that battled with some cowardice
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.120]   at certain points in his life,
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.000]   but after seeing the resurrection,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.400]   would eventually become so courageous
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.120]   that he would give his own life for Christ,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.600]   to the point of being crucified upside down,
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.040]   church history tells us,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.360]   and he writes this letter in 1 Peter,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.880]   and he's writing on, hey, here's how you should think,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.760]   and here's how you should live,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.160]   in light of the resurrection and in light of eternity,
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.600]   and I wanna walk through three things,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.340]   starting in verse seven, that he says,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.920]   that lay out how you and I are to think about this life.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.760]   Verse seven,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.720]   "The end of all things is near."
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.820]   Now, immediately, there's a problem with this statement,
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.800]   because he wrote it 2,000 years ago,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.600]   so was he wrong, or what is he saying?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.120]   The Bible says that you and I live
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.200]   in what's called the last days,
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.720]   and the last days are defined by the time
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.740]   between the first arrival of Jesus,
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.480]   when Jesus showed up originally,
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.600]   and the second return of Christ,
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.280]   and in comparison to all of eternity
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.320]   and billions and billions and billions of years,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.640]   we are, in essence, in the last days,
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.960]   and Peter is saying, in light of the fact
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.280]   that eternity is real and more near than you realize,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.560]   here's how you and I are to live,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.640]   and he lays out some really interesting invitations,
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.320]   telling us, hey, you don't need to live
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.340]   focused on accomplishing your bucket list.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.980]   This is how you should live in light
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.540]   of the reality of eternity, and he says,
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.440]   "So be alert and be of sober mind,
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.280]   "so that you may pray."
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.400]   First thing I wanna talk about is, he says,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.360]   you need to allow the reality of eternity
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.900]   and the fact that the end is near
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.840]   to give you a perspective to pray rightly.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.880]   The first idea I wanna talk about
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.720]   is praying with the right perspective,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.840]   praying with the right perspective,
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.160]   'cause that's a really interesting thing.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.280]   The end of all things is here, so pray.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.120]   Make sure you know that so it informs
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.060]   that you would pray rightly.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.320]   Why would he say that?
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.760]   It's a really interesting thing
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   when you're confronted with the reality
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.860]   of being near the end of your life, it does something.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.580]   It gives you a fresh perspective or a right perspective.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.420]   It puts things into perspective.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:11.260]   In June of 2007, Steve Jobs introduced
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.100]   something called the iPhone,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.520]   and this phone that he introduced
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.460]   had a lot of criticism around it,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.460]   and people thought, man, that'll never catch on,
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.280]   and the Razr phone is free,
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.980]   and in a very short amount of time,
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.780]   it spread like wildfire.
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.100]   It captured a majority of the market.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.780]   It was crazy, transformed so much of how we live,
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.380]   changed the world in many ways,
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:40.980]   and 52 months later, Steve Jobs was buried and died,
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.180]   and in the weeks leading up to his death,
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.620]   there were a circulation of some writings,
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.340]   or there was some writings that circulated after his death
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.940]   that were written and attributed to him
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.060]   from the weeks before he died,
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.260]   and they're pretty profound to hear.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.620]   Steve, as far as I know and as far as research would have,
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.740]   didn't have a relationship with the Lord,
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.380]   but the fact that the end was near
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.560]   put things into perspective, and he says this.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.660]   "I have reached the pinnacle of success
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.320]   "in the business world.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.020]   "In others' eyes, my life is the epitome of success.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.780]   "However, aside from my work, I have little joy.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.600]   "In the end, my wealth is only a fact of life
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.740]   "that I'm accustomed to.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.040]   "At this moment, lying on my bed and recalling my life,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.500]   "I realize that all the recognition and wealth
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.860]   "that I took so much pride in have paled
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.300]   "and become meaningless in the face of my death.
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.760]   "Treasure love for your family, love for your spouse,
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.360]   "love for your friends, treat yourself well,
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.340]   "cherish others.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.640]   "As we grow older and hopefully wiser,
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.060]   "we realize that a $3,000 or a $30 watch
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.080]   "both tell the same time.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.280]   "You will realize that true inner happiness
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.420]   "doesn't come from material things in this world.
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.360]   "Whether you fly first class or economy,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   "if the plane goes down, you go down with it."
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.920]   But there's something about the end in mind
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.040]   and knowing that and believing that and embracing that,
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.940]   it just puts things into perspective.
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.720]   And Peter is saying, "The end is near.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.280]   "Eternity is real."
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.400]   And so live in light of that and allow that
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.360]   to shape the way that you pray,
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.680]   to impact the things that you focus on,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.760]   to pray rightly, asking for God's will.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.740]   So often in life, we think of prayer like,
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.840]   which is just talking to God,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.860]   but we think of it like room service.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.520]   What's room service?
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.320]   Room service, you know, you're at the hotel
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.360]   and you find yourself hungry and you're like,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.560]   "Oh, I'm gonna call down and order one of those pizzas
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.980]   "for $87 or I'm gonna ask them if they have another blanket
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.640]   "'cause it's too cold in my room or I need another pillow
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.240]   "and I just occasionally will call
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.740]   "based on things that I want."
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.160]   And the picture painted in scripture
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.920]   of what prayer is like for believers
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.920]   is not room service, but it's like a walkie talkie
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.080]   a soldier uses while walking in the battle
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.920]   that I'm in constant communication
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.520]   with the commander and his intent.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.840]   That you and I are to be on constant alert to say,
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.560]   "God, what would you have me do in this situation?
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.040]   "I'm walking into work and I'm anxious over that coworker
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.120]   "and how they're gonna treat me.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.620]   "And God, would you help me to know
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.840]   "how to love them in this moment?
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.900]   "God, you know that I'm headed over to see a family member
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.300]   "and they've been so hurtful for me
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.460]   "and so I'm in constant communication.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.420]   "God, will you help me to love
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.500]   "like you would have me love them?
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.520]   "God, I don't wanna forgive them,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.540]   "but will you help me to have the strength to forgive them?
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.800]   "That I'm constantly in communication with God.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   "God, I'm gonna be tempted in this scenario
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.240]   "to lust after that billboard
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.840]   "that I know that I drive by every single day.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.280]   "God, will you help me to have the strength
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.520]   "to fight this temptation?
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.340]   "I'm in constant communication with God
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.500]   "for his will, for his agenda.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.380]   "God, will you help me?
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.680]   "I'm an introvert, so whenever I go to places
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.100]   "and I wanna look for times to share my faith,
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.640]   "I just find myself, I'm so uncomfortable
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.600]   "and I don't know how to do this.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.000]   "God, will you help me?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.200]   "And will you give me the words,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.400]   "give me the clarity
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:09.620]   "that I'd have the ability to share my faith?"
[00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.960]   And Peter is saying, "This life is short.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.100]   "And your perspective is gonna shape what you focus on.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.780]   "And you focus, and what you focus on
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:17.960]   "is gonna shape your prayers.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.140]   "And you and I have an invitation to use prayer
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.260]   "and to spend our life focused on God's agenda
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   "and God's kingdom, or to waste it by focusing on our own."
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.640]   It's funny how perspective,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.680]   it really does change what you focus on.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.840]   When I was in Malibu at that house,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.180]   like, man, it was a cool house,
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.200]   but there were some things that, you know,
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.720]   it's just a little bit like,
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.600]   kind of too modern for my vibe.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.360]   The couch, I wasn't crazy about it,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.360]   but just some furniture I didn't particularly love.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.140]   You know what never crossed my mind when I was there?
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.020]   I was there for five days.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.360]   It never crossed my mind to go,
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.220]   "You know what, I'm done.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.260]   "This couch, it's out.
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.600]   "I'm going to rooms to go
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.960]   "and I'm getting a new couch in here
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.080]   "because I just can't live with this anymore."
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.920]   Why?
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.400]   Because I knew that wasn't my home.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.600]   I wasn't staying there.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.200]   And that perspective and the reality of eternity,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.320]   it allows us to live this life knowing,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.120]   man, I don't have to solely focus.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.040]   I don't have to focus on me accumulating
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.560]   or me accomplishing.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.400]   God, I can focus on you and your agenda.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.720]   'Cause here's the saddest thing.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.000]   When I said Steve Jobs changed the world,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.440]   in a billion years, in eternity and in heaven,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.200]   no one will be thinking about Steve Jobs
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.480]   and his impact through the iPhone.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.320]   No one.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.280]   And this world would say,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.520]   "Man, that was an amazing accomplishment."
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   In a billion years, what people will be thinking of
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.400]   is the person who came to faith in Christ
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.680]   at your office place, in your apartment complex,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.200]   where you live and your family,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.240]   because you shared the gospel with them.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.920]   And Peter is saying, "Man, don't lose heart.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.760]   "Don't lose perspective.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.040]   "Don't focus on this life.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.440]   "Every message is going to come at you like,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.380]   "'Hey, live for you, live for you, focus on you,'
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.960]   "and it's going to lead you to not see the bigger picture
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.280]   "and ask God to move inside of your life."
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.680]   Here's something you probably have never thought about.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.480]   You know, there's going to come a day
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.880]   where you will never be able to pray again.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   You will never have the chance to invite God
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.520]   to move in a broken world
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.020]   and in the places and spaces that you live,
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.000]   because you'll be fully in the presence of God
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.700]   and you'll never have the opportunity to speak to him.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.300]   And not only is prayer a chance for you to say,
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.140]   "God, will you help me?
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.240]   "I want to be on mission for you,"
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.260]   or, "God, help me right now,
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.100]   "because I honestly don't want to be on mission for you."
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.640]   It's also something that just grows
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.220]   our relationship with God, the more and more that we do it.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.600]   It almost raises our just God awareness in our life.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.160]   My wife, when we dated in college,
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.940]   she spent a summer in Spain,
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   and this was before iPhones or FaceTime or any of that.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.740]   And I remember that because there was a time difference,
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.040]   I would just go out of my way to prioritize
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.400]   if she was available to call.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.320]   So she would call at three in the afternoon,
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.480]   and it's like two in the morning over here,
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.520]   and I'm like, "Hey, how are you?
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.360]   "How are you?"
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.980]   And I looked forward to those phone calls every single time.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.320]   And we would talk,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.300]   and I don't even remember anything that we talked about.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.500]   I just remember constantly,
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.700]   even though I knew I was gonna see her soon,
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.200]   the desire to have that communication,
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.540]   it just strengthened our relationship.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.040]   And the picture scripture gives us is,
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.320]   man, prayer is this invitation
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.560]   to invite God into your world,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.800]   invite him to move,
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.640]   to set our minds on things that actually matter.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.200]   And in the process,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.000]   it strengthens our relationship along the way.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.980]   And Peter says, "Hey, in light of the fact
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.340]   "that eternity is real,
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.120]   "pray with the right perspective."
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.640]   God wants to move.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.080]   Invite him in your life.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.360]   The number of prayers that you have left in life,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.540]   it is limited.
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:56.200]   But don't let it be limited by time.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   Let it be limited by you.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.880]   Or let it be limited by time,
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.320]   not let it be limited by you.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.520]   And then he moves into a second thing.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.080]   "In light of eternity, the end is near.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080]   "Here's how you should live."
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.420]   And he says this,
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.880]   "Above all,
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.160]   "love each other deeply."
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.320]   Or your translation may say strenuously or fervently.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.360]   Because love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.000]   "Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.720]   Says, "Above everything else."
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.040]   Here's another thing, "In light of eternity,
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.680]   "love each other deeply."
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.520]   Or the second idea is to love beyond your limits.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.360]   Why do I say that?
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.680]   Well, the Greek word for deeply
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.220]   is the Greek word ektinos.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.880]   It's a word that literally means strenuously.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.460]   It was a word that was associated with Greek runners
[00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.840]   when they would cross a finish line at the Olympics
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.120]   and they would strain and stretch forward.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.360]   And Paul says, "When it comes to love,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.980]   "I want you to stretch the boundaries
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.520]   "and the limits of your love towards other people.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.900]   "I want you to love people in a way
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.120]   "that stretches beyond what is comfortable."
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.080]   What does that even mean?
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.440]   Or how does that look like in my life?
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.200]   This is loving when it's not easy.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.580]   And he's saying, "Hey, you wanna live in light of eternity,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:23.240]   "be someone who is marked with the birthmark of Christianity."
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.560]   Which is what Jesus says.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.480]   Christians are marked by love.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.880]   "But do so in a way that stretches when it's hard,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.720]   "with a coworker who's not a believer
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.120]   "and candidly they treat you poorly.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.260]   "With a family member or the sibling
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.980]   "who mocks you for your faith."
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:43.020]   He's saying even that person in the face of whatever it is,
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.060]   even when it's not easy,
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.940]   'cause that's the only way that you can have a love
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.140]   that is stretching beyond what's comfortable.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.740]   It's easy to love people and they love us back.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.100]   And he's saying, "Be marked by love at all times
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.220]   "and love even when it is not comfortable.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.720]   "Go beyond the limits and the boundaries."
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.460]   I was thinking about just how convicting that is
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.560]   for me personally in my own life,
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.760]   of just saying, "God, will you help me
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.940]   "to stretch the boundaries of the way that I love people,
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.720]   "hard and easy inside of my life."
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.060]   And in particular, I was thinking of a friend on my team.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.420]   He was up here earlier, Josiah.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.420]   And just the ways that he loves people.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.020]   I'm so challenged and encouraged by seeing someone
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.020]   who even when they're exhausted or pushed is just saying,
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.420]   "Man, I'm gonna love this person beyond the limits
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.660]   "of what I may feel right now, even when it's not easy."
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.340]   The Greek word for love here is a really interesting one.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.940]   I don't have really a lot of time to go into it,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.500]   but it's a Greek word for agape.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.340]   And if you're a Christian,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.660]   you've probably heard that word before,
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.060]   but here's what makes agape love different.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.740]   So in Greek, which is what the New Testament was written in,
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.660]   they had these different words for love.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.200]   Each of them had slight differences.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   There was words that had emotional love.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.660]   It would be like, man, a friendship or a romantic person
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.540]   that you were moved to love.
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.420]   Agape love was different.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.820]   It wasn't emotional.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.580]   It was volitional.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.940]   It was a decision.
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.940]   That it was a form of love that didn't act based on feeling
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.700]   and act based on undeciding.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.540]   And the perfect example of agape love
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.420]   was Christ going on the cross, not saying,
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.260]   "Man, I feel like I really want to be crucified,"
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.180]   but saying, "I am making the decision to sacrificially love
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.020]   "and lay down my life for other people."
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.260]   And Paul says, "You and I are to be marked
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.300]   "by that agape love."
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.700]   What else is interesting, and again,
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.220]   I don't have a ton of time.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.700]   The Greek word agape love,
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.940]   when you look at Greek literature,
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.000]   prior to the New Testament being written,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.660]   the occasions where it described someone loving someone
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.580]   are unbelievably rare.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.360]   It wasn't until Christians showed up on the scene
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.580]   and the world looked, and it's like they were marked
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.260]   by this radical, deciding love to choose to sacrifice
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.860]   for the good and benefit of other people.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.980]   And they began to associate it with Christians
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.540]   and Christianity in particular.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.160]   Tertullian, who was an early church father and writer,
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.660]   even remarked of how one of the highest criticisms
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.940]   or constant criticisms was that these Christians
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.620]   were so marked by love.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.520]   It said, this is from Apologeticus, chapter 39.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.740]   "What marks us in the eyes of our enemies
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.220]   "is our loving kindness.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.220]   "Only look, they say, look how they love one another."
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.820]   Peter says, "Man, if you want to be someone
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.700]   "who lives in light of eternity, love others,
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.600]   "and love in a way that is beyond the boundaries
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.140]   "of what's comfortable and easy."
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.620]   And he says, "When you do so, it covers a multitude of sins.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.580]   "It is a love that is covering."
[00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.260]   And he quotes from Proverbs, chapter 12,
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.180]   which is a verse of love covering a multitude of sins.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.520]   But it's a love that's saying,
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.760]   "Because I love you," or it's a love that's not saying,
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.880]   "Hey, because I love you, I'm gonna see your faults
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.720]   "and I'm gonna decide those aren't even faults anymore."
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:11.600]   No, it's saying, "I'm gonna love you and I see your faults
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.980]   "and they're still faults, but I'm choosing to love you."
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.860]   It's not embracing sin, it's saying,
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.180]   "I'm gonna choose to love you."
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.720]   Despite your sin and despite my sin,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.260]   I'm gonna choose to cover and care about you.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.540]   And then he brings up hospitality,
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.600]   and hospitality feels like a random term,
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.420]   but hospitality is the New Testament word
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.460]   that literally means to love a stranger.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.340]   So he says, "Man, love those who are around you,
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.540]   "love beyond limits, and stretch your love
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.340]   "even when it's hard, and love strangers
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.200]   "and people that God puts in your path."
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.280]   What if it's true that God has you where you work,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.140]   where you're sitting right now,
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.440]   where you're gonna sit on the plane ride home,
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.960]   where you're gonna stop later for food in the morning?
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.720]   Like he's put you there to be an extension
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.580]   and expression of his love.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.020]   He's put you there to care.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.520]   Last week on Monday, I was going to lunch with Sam,
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.220]   who's the director of this conference,
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.720]   and just crushed it, we'll celebrate him
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.680]   just all the ways that he's been behind everything,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   candidly, and the amazing theme that he leads, you see.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.160]   We were going to lunch, and on the way back from lunch,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.900]   we got in his car, and he went to start his car,
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:37.920]   and it just was clear, man, this is not going anywhere.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.060]   And so he's like, "I think I have some jumper cables,"
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.280]   and he goes to the back, and he pulls out jumper cables
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.640]   that look like they're from World War II or something,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.040]   and he's like, "Man, I think I can do something with these."
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.880]   And I'm like, "Man, we're at least gonna need a truck,"
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   and I'm pretty sure that's not even jumper cables,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.280]   but I look up, and right in front of me is this guy
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.840]   in this big truck, and I said,
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.940]   "Hey, do you mind giving us a jump?"
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.360]   And he very quickly gets out of his car,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.840]   walks immediately over, takes this black bag,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.120]   it looked like black velvet, it's like this big,
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.480]   pulls out of the back bag a black box,
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.520]   it's like completely shiny, it just was like,
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.600]   I have no idea what's about to happen.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.080]   We're either about to disappear,
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.920]   like we're in Men in Black or something,
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.800]   and then he pulls these two little cables out,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   and Sam's holding these, again, from before time, cables,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.120]   and he's like, "You're not gonna need that."
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   And he attaches it, pushes a button,
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.880]   and he says, "Wait 10 seconds?
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.800]   "All right, turn the car on."
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.480]   And I'm sitting there on the phone with Josiah going,
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.800]   "Hey, bro, we're gonna need a ride,
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.640]   "I don't know if this is gonna work,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.760]   "there's some guy that's here,"
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.040]   and I was like, "What was your name again?"
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.680]   "Dusty, Austin Dusty."
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.000]   And then he goes, "Turn the car."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.320]   And started right up.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.880]   And I'm like, "Okay, I gotta go,
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.280]   "I think I just met an angel."
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.600]   And I'm like, "Man, hey, thank you."
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.840]   And he's like, "Sorry, I can't talk."
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.400]   And he was just like, "Thanks so much,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.920]   "don't worry about it, man, I really gotta go though."
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.040]   And he walked off, and then he just disappeared
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.280]   as he walked away.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.120]   And it was like, that didn't happen,
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.200]   that's what didn't happen.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.200]   But it felt like, oh my gosh, what in the world,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.680]   this person, just like, out of nowhere,
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.960]   in front of us, is there,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.200]   and it felt like he was placed there to care for us.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.920]   Now, I don't know any of his story,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.040]   and that is really true, he quickly had to go.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.680]   And I don't know if he was placed there to care,
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.800]   but I do know if you're a believer,
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.680]   you've been placed there to care.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.240]   And you're the hands and feet of Christ
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.600]   in order to care for people around you.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.400]   Which is where he goes next,
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.600]   and he brings up the final thing,
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.920]   so hey, you're gonna pray rightly,
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.040]   pray in light of perspective,
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.920]   pray and ask God to do eternal things in your life.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.240]   Oh man, I'm gonna love deeply,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.760]   I wanna love people and be an extension of God's love
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.480]   for the world around us.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.160]   And then he says, "Each of you should use
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.640]   "whatever gift you have received,"
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.480]   talking about spiritual gifts,
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.740]   "to serve others as faithful stewards
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:11.260]   "of God's grace in various forms."
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.720]   If anyone speaks, they should do so
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.160]   as one who speaks the very words of God.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.040]   If anyone serves, he brings up different gifts.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.280]   They should do so with the strength God provides.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.000]   "So that in all things,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.340]   "God may be praised through Jesus Christ.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:32.340]   "To him be the glory and power forever and ever, amen."
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.600]   So Peter lays out a number of different profound truths,
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.800]   but he says, hey, every Christian
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   has been given a spiritual gift.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.860]   Every one of you, when you trusted in Jesus,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.480]   you were given by the Spirit of God,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.880]   whether you realize it or not, a gift.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.000]   And it's a gift that he says is given to you
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.120]   in order to give to other people,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.680]   in order to serve other people.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   And it's a gift that when that happens,
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.320]   brings honor and glory to God.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.200]   That's what basically he said.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.160]   And he's saying, hey, use the gifts that God has given you
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.040]   and use them to serve other people around you.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.280]   And when you do, it brings honor to the gift giver,
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.800]   which is God.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.500]   The third idea from the text is that you and I,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.140]   and we wanna live in light of eternity
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.020]   and live with eternity in mind.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.300]   It involves serving others sacrificially,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.980]   praying with the right perspective,
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.400]   loving others beyond our limits,
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.140]   and then serving others sacrificially.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.940]   God has given you gifts, you,
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.380]   that he wants to be used and given
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.260]   to others in this world.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.780]   Every year at Christmas,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:44.740]   my father will send Christmas gifts to our kids
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.700]   and he'll send them and I'll open the package
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.900]   and realize, oh, these are gifts for my kids.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:56.780]   If I was to take those gifts that I received
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.700]   and hoard them for myself and not give them to my kids,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.600]   who they were to be given to, through me to them,
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.380]   you would think, man, that is messed up.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.340]   What use do you have for a Nerf gun?
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:16.340]   What would you want with some princess doll?
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.700]   It just would be like, man, that's bizarre.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.580]   Those are gifts given to you to be given to them.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.780]   And that's the picture that scripture paints,
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.240]   that God has given you and I gifts.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.980]   Every one of you has gifts that God has entrusted to you,
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.420]   spiritual gifts that he wants you to use
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.260]   no matter where you live,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.620]   no matter what your story is.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.300]   The spirit of God wants to give those gifts
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.220]   through you to the world around us.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.980]   And in scripture, we're told,
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.740]   'cause we don't have a lot of time to go exhaustively
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.740]   into the spiritual gifts that God has given,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.160]   but there's different spiritual gifts that are given,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.900]   some referenced here in Romans chapter 12,
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.380]   it talks about prophetically speaking,
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:03.500]   serving, teaching, encouraging.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.060]   Like somebody who have the gift of encouragement.
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.900]   And as lovingly as I can say it,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.160]   like God has given you that gift
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.460]   so you would be an encourager to people around you.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.940]   But because of just the insecurities and hurt and stuff
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.620]   that God wants to work through and bring healing,
[00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.260]   you're not sharing that encouragement.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.900]   Because you're too focused on the pain
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.060]   that God wants to work through
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.760]   that you still want to hold on to.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.980]   He expresses that there's gifts like leadership.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.620]   You have a gift of giving, gift of mercy.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.500]   First Corinthians 12, verse four through 11 says,
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.940]   "God will give people the gift of wisdom,
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.360]   "of intuition or knowledge, the gift of faith,
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.460]   "the gift of healing, the gift of discernment
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.940]   "and speaking foreign tongues,
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.060]   "the gift of helping and administration and leadership."
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.980]   In First Corinthians 12, 28.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.140]   "I don't know what your gifts are,
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.280]   "but I know the Spirit of God has entrusted
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.460]   "and given gifts to you that he wants to be used
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.500]   "to build his church and his kingdom in this life."
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.460]   How do you know what your gifts are really quickly?
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.100]   A lot of times you just have to
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.280]   see which things God stirs your hearts towards.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.860]   What are the things that other people affirm?
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.900]   Maybe you love sharing your faith
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.100]   and it comes naturally to you
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.300]   and maybe you have the gift of evangelism.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.580]   Maybe you are someone who has a real gift
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.860]   for creating environments and caring for people
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.700]   and you have the gift of hospitality
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.460]   or the gift of serving.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.620]   Maybe you're just a good communicator
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.380]   as it relates to helping people understand the Bible,
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.500]   not on a stage, maybe on a stage,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.220]   but just in a small group with other people.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.420]   I don't know what the gifts he's given you are,
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.620]   but I know that they were given
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:49.200]   so that they would be given through you
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.340]   to the people in the world around us.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:58.200]   In World War II, in a small village called Strasbourg, France
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.560]   there was a church building
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:06.800]   that was destroyed and bombed by Nazi bombings.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.160]   And after the wreckage and the rubble,
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   they were picking up the church building.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.600]   It's this small village.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.920]   And inside of that church building
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.760]   where they began to restore all the broken walls
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.080]   and beams that had fallen,
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.100]   underneath all of it they found this statue of Jesus
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.580]   that was entirely, it was totally fine except one thing.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.640]   Its hands had been broken off when a beam fell on it.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.040]   And this is a town, they don't have a lot of churches
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.940]   and there's not a lot of things.
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.780]   So of course everyone's going,
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.780]   "Hey, what are we gonna do?
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.620]   "And we gotta fix that Jesus statue.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.700]   "I mean, this is a big deal."
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.020]   And so some time went by and people are deciding,
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.580]   "Should we hire a sculptor to come in
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.900]   "and create hands that are placed on there?"
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.780]   And then one day people showed up in the church
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.100]   and on the statue of Jesus,
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.660]   completely there with the hands gone,
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.120]   there was a sign that said, "He has no hands but ours."
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.860]   And the truth, if you're a believer,
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.260]   it says you're the body of Christ.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.500]   You're the closest representation of Jesus
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.660]   anyone in our world will ever experience.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.900]   And he has no hands to serve and extend
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.440]   or the hands he's chosen to extend to our world
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.940]   is yours and mine.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.100]   And he's saying, "You have spiritual gifts
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.080]   "that were given not to be held on by you,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.540]   "but to be poured to the world around us,
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.380]   "that you would use the gifts that God has given you."
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.100]   Whether that is in leading a small group
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.020]   of high school kids and caring and showing up.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.660]   Maybe God has given you the gift
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.280]   of understanding and learning,
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.940]   and he wants you to start something
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.160]   or go be a part of something
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.460]   in socioeconomic disadvantaged areas
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.780]   where you just tutor kids and you spend time to 'em
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.100]   and they don't have a father around,
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.700]   but you're pouring into 'em and you're teaching 'em math,
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.020]   but you're teaching 'em so much more
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.580]   and you're showing him your life and the gospel through it.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.680]   Maybe he's calling you to start something or go serve,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.600]   and there's so many different ministries represented
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.720]   and that are so connected and close
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.460]   to wherever you live inside of this room,
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.340]   to serve with elderly communities or at a nursing home
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.480]   where you go and administer
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.680]   to some of the loneliest people in society
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   and you just show up
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.920]   and you don't have any relationship with them.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.040]   You just say, "Man, I'm just gonna love you
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.780]   "and share Jesus and the gospel with you."
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.320]   Maybe he's calling you to go on mission
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.240]   and he's calling you to pick your life up
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.180]   and make a decision to change where you live.
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.020]   Maybe he's not.
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.780]   Maybe he's calling you to start a Bible study
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:25.460]   in your business or company or the office that you're at.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:26.600]   I don't know what he's calling you to do.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.140]   I know that he has been given or he has given you gifts
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.360]   and he has called you to use those
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.960]   because he has no hands but yours.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.380]   And Peter says, "If you wanna live in light of eternity,
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.700]   "you take those gifts that God uniquely gave you
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.480]   "and you use them for his glory."
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.680]   And here's where this becomes really important.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.900]   There's something, there's a paradox of the Christian life
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.580]   that the more that I focus on myself
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.300]   and I focus on using my gifts and my time and my talents
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.160]   and my energy to build my kingdom and accomplish my agenda
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.280]   and set up my comfort, I lose my life.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.160]   The Bible says the more that you try to hold
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.700]   and gain your life, you lose it.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.860]   But the more that you lose your life for his sake,
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.380]   you find it.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.180]   And the reason why oftentimes
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.420]   we can find ourselves so depressed and in such a bad place
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.100]   is because the focus and constant goal of your life
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.020]   is all about you.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.340]   It's not about serving other people.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.420]   And you know what happens when all you do is take in,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.020]   take in, take in, and you go to church,
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.180]   you listen to the PORCH podcast,
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.260]   you listen to Views from the Porch,
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.800]   you listen to other podcast places,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.300]   you take in, you take in, but you never pour out.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.980]   Spiritually, you begin to die.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.020]   It's a law of nature, but it's also a law of reality.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:33.660]   If I said everybody in the room,
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.100]   just breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe in,
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.920]   and you never breathe out, you die.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.820]   The Dead Sea is a sea that you've probably heard referenced
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.140]   in the Bible, and it's a sea that's near
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.980]   in the places that Jesus lived,
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.740]   and there's beauty all around it.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:52.740]   But there's something crazy about the Dead Sea.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.100]   Everything that is in it is dead,
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.300]   because it's a sea that has only water and rivers
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.220]   that flow into it, but never flow out of it.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:06.540]   And so if you only take in, and you only receive,
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.220]   and you never pour out, you die.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.960]   And for your own growth, spiritual health,
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:21.260]   experiencing serving others is a means
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.940]   by which you can experience more
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.060]   of the abundant life God wants you to have.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.200]   And the more that you resist that or refuse to do that,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.740]   you're not gonna experience spiritual growth,
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.780]   but spiritual death.
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.960]   And I don't mean for eternity,
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.340]   I mean you're just not gonna experience
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.900]   the abundant life that God wants you to experience.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.140]   Peter says, "But you can,
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.180]   "but it involves serving sacrificially."
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.220]   Maybe just last thing, and then I'll wrap up.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.380]   Maybe the most important application
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.040]   some of you can make is when you leave this conference,
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.740]   you're gonna call or text your pastor,
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.260]   you're gonna call or text a ministry leader,
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.540]   you're gonna call or text somebody and just say,
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.860]   "Hey, I don't know how to serve, but I need to serve.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.080]   "How can I serve?
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.100]   "How can I help?
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.120]   "What can I do?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.020]   "How can I be a part of what God is doing?
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.140]   "I want to serve and be a part of reaching people for Jesus
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.740]   "with the short amount of time in life that I have."
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:15.420]   In conclusion, if you wanna live in light of eternity,
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.100]   Peter says it involves, you're gonna pray in perspective.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.920]   You're going to love other people deeply,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.260]   and then you're gonna serve others sacrificially.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.100]   Let me close with this.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.980]   I'm gonna invite the band to come up,
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.420]   and probably should have given them more of a heads up,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.260]   but they're coming out, here they are.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.220]   And let me tell you a little bit about this band.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.780]   So let me introduce, especially,
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.040]   'cause a lot of us in the room,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.540]   in fact, most of us in the room,
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:45.180]   are not from Texas, let alone from Dallas,
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.220]   and probably are not familiar with the band that is here.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.900]   So each one of these guys plays a specific role,
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.220]   plays a different part.
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.660]   We've got J-Rob, where's Hayden?
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:54.580]   Hayden?
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.900]   You got J-Rob over here playing drums.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.980]   Then we've got Esteban over here playing bass.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.500]   (audience cheering)
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.580]   Sam, and, oh, you're over there.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.220]   You've been there the whole time.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.660]   Man.
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.060]   Sam and Adam Prince on the keys.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.900]   We don't have just one,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.320]   we have two piano players for this weekend.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.980]   And we have Jake and Wellington playing on the guitar.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.500]   They're gonna play a song here in a second,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.100]   but let me say this, I love this band.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.660]   It is like one of the greatest privileges
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:24.980]   to get to sit and worship with them,
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.440]   and I love them even more as people.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.080]   But as a band, each one of them plays a specific role.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.700]   So y'all start playing a song,
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.540]   and each of them plays a different instrument,
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.580]   and their instrument, they do different things with.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.020]   So some are plucking strings,
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.020]   some are hitting, you know, ivories,
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:44.920]   some are singing songs.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.280]   Each of them plays different roles.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.580]   Now here's what happens if a couple of them,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.460]   as they're all collectively coming together,
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.180]   and they're playing this one song,
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.980]   and it sounds amazing, and it sounds with purpose and beauty,
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.980]   you take out a couple of them,
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.940]   say, "J-Rob, stop playing.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.200]   "Jake, stop playing.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.460]   "Wellington, stop playing."
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:09.080]   All of the beauty, and what was, and potential,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.800]   you take out a couple of people not playing their role,
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.100]   not using their gifts,
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.340]   not playing their instrument, so to speak,
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.000]   and what could have been no longer is.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.220]   Not only that, if you all play together again,
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.500]   if you have a couple of them that decide,
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.220]   "You know what, we're gonna play this song,
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.680]   "but you know, I don't like that song.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.320]   "I wanna use my gifts to do what I wanna do.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.740]   "I wanna play the instrument I wanna play."
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.180]   And you have the keys, or you have the electric guitars
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.300]   play a different song than everybody else.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.340]   Notice.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.700]   All right, that's enough.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:50.100]   It's not just not reaching its full potential.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.660]   It's worse.
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.840]   It's confusing.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.360]   It's, listen, it's distracting.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.060]   And it doesn't come off as appealing and attractive.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.580]   Could it be as simple as this?
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.780]   God has given you gifts and a life,
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.100]   and through that life, he wants to use those gifts
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.220]   to join with others with different gifts
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.980]   and building the kingdom of God,
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.900]   and you have the decision,
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.020]   "Am I gonna sit out and rob the church
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.440]   "of the potential it has,
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.140]   "or am I gonna play a different song, not God's song?
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.340]   "I'm gonna play my song 'cause I wanna live my song,"
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.140]   and be distracting to the world who looks to your life,
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.380]   who claims to be a Christian,
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.940]   and you got the bio,
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   you have a verse in your Instagram bio,
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.020]   "But you do not sing the song of heaven
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.500]   "with your life and how you think and how you live,"
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.820]   and it's distracting, and it's confusing.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.300]   And I don't say that out of anything other than love for you
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:46.020]   'cause all I want and I'll hold hope through this conference
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.100]   is that you would live in light of eternity.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.180]   The end is near.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.280]   God is real.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.340]   You have purpose.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.780]   He placed you here with gifts.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.180]   He placed you here for a reason,
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.860]   where you live, who you're around,
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.860]   and he wants to see you experience abundant life
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.340]   by praying and inviting him for eternal things,
[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.780]   loving people beyond what is easy
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.340]   and the limits that you feel,
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.180]   and by serving like he did sacrificially on the cross,
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.780]   and in so doing, you experience life.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.660]   Let me pray.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.580]   Father, I thank you for every person here,
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.820]   and God, we confess,
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:33.420]   there are constant things fighting for our attention.
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.740]   There are constant ways that we have the world saying,
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.740]   sing this song, not the song of the savior of the world,
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.780]   the good news of Jesus.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.660]   Focus on yourself,
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.820]   and we ask for your help.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.660]   I pray that you would move us to be more like Jesus,
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.780]   who served sacrificially, loved beyond any limit,
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:04.660]   and who constantly lived from the right perspective.
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:08.940]   Father, would you take our lives
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:15.940]   and do supernatural serving through them,
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:20.620]   that you have no hands but ours,
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.660]   and so we just say, God, use our life.
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.780]   Save us from living for this world,
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:30.820]   and help us by your spirit.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:37.380]   In the name of your son, our savior, Jesus, amen.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
