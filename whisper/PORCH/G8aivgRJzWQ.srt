1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 (drum roll)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,040
 - Kira mentioned that we have something exciting

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,880
 coming up next week.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,200
 I'm gonna tell you what that is.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,960
 The launch retreat is here, it's back.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,040
 Registration next week.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,960
 Has anyone been to launch in this crowd before?

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,160
 Anyone in Fort Worth been to launch before?

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,120
 Here's why I tell you that,

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,360
 because you are going to want to make sure

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,480
 you are here next Tuesday night,

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,600
 or if you can't be here, that you register online.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,520
 If you don't know what the launch retreat is,

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,400
 ask someone who raised their hand and was excited.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,280
 You're not going to want to miss out.

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,080
 It's like the single funnest three days

17
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,320
 by a lake that we do.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
 We go out to Sky Ranch, it's a blast.

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
 There's only a thousand spots,

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,360
 and it's gonna sell out in two to three days, maybe more.

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,400
 In the last couple years,

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,520
 it's sold out in three to four days.

23
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,200
 So we're telling you now,

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,000
 so that if you have never been,

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,960
 or if you don't know whether to be here next week,

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,000
 you're going to want to be here next week.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,240
 Or make sure you're online, seven o'clock,

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,600
 you can register online.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,520
 One of my favorite launch graphics we've ever had,

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,400
 every year we have like a theme,

31
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
 and then we have graphics and speakers

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,480
 and all kinds of stuff that come with it.

33
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,200
 And one of my favorite graphics we ever had

34
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,920
 was actually this one from 2010,

35
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
 which I think they're going,

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,560
 there it is right there, launch.

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,040
 And here's why it was both my favorite and not favorite,

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,000
 maybe just the most memorable one I had,

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,200
 is because it has on it a magic eye.

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,040
 There it is.

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,880
 You guys see this?

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,880
 Remember magic eye, reading "Rainbow Days," magic eye?

43
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,760
 So inside of that picture,

44
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,080
 I don't know if you're like me,

45
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 but I have never in my life been able to see

46
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,440
 whatever is in that picture.

47
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,920
 It's like everyone's, there's a conspiracy going on,

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,080
 'cause all I see is specks.

49
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,280
 Can anyone see it right now?

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,080
 Anyone?

51
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
 No, nobody can?

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
 Okay, we got a couple in there.

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,320
 What kind of picture is this back there, tech team?

54
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,800
 It is birds.

55
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,640
 Here's what I love about it,

56
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,680
 is that if you're like the kind of person like me,

57
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,440
 is anyone like me where you can't?

58
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,400
 Am I alone here?

59
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,680
 I can't ever see the graphic that's up there?

60
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,920
 If you're that person, everyone who can see it,

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
 like our friends down here, is like,

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
 here's what you need to do.

63
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,760
 You just need to blur your eyes and cross it a little bit

64
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,440
 and look through it, but don't, but just relax,

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
 but let it come into focus.

66
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
 And you're like, is this a joke right now?

67
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
 Are you messing with me?

68
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,720
 And then it feels like you're left out,

69
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,960
 'cause they're like, oh my gosh,

70
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,680
 this is unbelievable in there.

71
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
 It's a secret code.

72
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,720
 And now you're not able to see it,

73
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,080
 and you feel left out.

74
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,480
 Because you, for whatever reason,

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
 don't possess whatever it takes.

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,160
 I mean, literally, for as long as I can remember,

77
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,000
 I've never been able to like see whatever's in these things.

78
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,960
 It's as though my like brain or something,

79
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,720
 I don't have the gene that allows me to see it.

80
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,240
 I don't have what it takes to see whatever is there.

81
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,800
 And the reason I set up with that story

82
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,240
 is because tonight, we are going to discuss a topic

83
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,680
 about what the Bible says you must have

84
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,320
 in order to see heaven.

85
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
 In other words, we're gonna talk about the quality

86
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,880
 that you must possess and I must possess

87
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,840
 if you don't want to be left out of seeing heaven.

88
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,440
 Because I know one thing about all of us in the room,

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
 even if you're like, I don't know what I believe,

90
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,040
 if there is a heaven and a hell,

91
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,160
 we would like to possess whatever it takes to go to heaven.

92
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,880
 No one's like, oh, I'm kind of 50/50.

93
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,120
 Everyone's very confident that they would like to possess

94
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,560
 whatever that is.

95
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,040
 And so tonight, we're really gonna discuss

96
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,960
 what that is because here's,

97
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,080
 I'm gonna give you the punchline

98
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,040
 and then we're gonna explore it.

99
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,720
 What the Bible says you and I must have

100
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 in order for us to see heaven is we must be born again.

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,800
 And before I lose you and you're going, born again,

102
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
 what does that mean?

103
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,960
 Culture, there's a lot of terms.

104
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,440
 You've probably heard that phrase, born again.

105
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
 Tonight, we're gonna discuss what the Bible says

106
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
 as it relates to this topic.

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,240
 And it may not be what you think,

108
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,960
 but it does tell us if you do not meet the prerequisites,

109
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,920
 if you don't have this one thing, you will not see heaven.

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
 What do I mean by that?

111
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,160
 You will not see Jesus, you will go to hell.

112
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,040
 That's the plainest way that I can say it.

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,920
 If you do not have this thing that we're talking about.

114
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,160
 So tonight, we're gonna discuss

115
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,080
 what it means to be born again.

116
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
 Does it look a certain way?

117
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
 Does it mean you're a Republican?

118
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,040
 Does it mean that you live in a certain area?

119
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,280
 What does it mean to be born again?

120
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,480
 And we're really gonna find the meaning of this

121
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,840
 in one of everyone's favorite stories in the Bible,

122
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,560
 the story of Nicodemus.

123
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
 Okay, no one's favorite story,

124
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,400
 but in the story of Nicodemus,

125
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
 we're gonna be in John chapter three.

126
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open there now.

127
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,480
 Here's what we're doing for the next two weeks.

128
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,120
 We're really taking a break

129
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,160
 before we launch into our series this summer,

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,200
 which is gonna be called Summer on the Mount.

131
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,440
 Or for the next 10 weeks, starting in June,

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,280
 we will go through the greatest sermon ever told by Jesus.

133
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,040
 And for the next two weeks, we're gonna do two one-offs.

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,240
 And as I was looking, along with a team and JP,

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,160
 we were just praying through what to teach tonight,

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
 I couldn't think of a more important message

137
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,240
 for our audience than to discuss a criteria

138
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,440
 that we know not everyone in the room has,

139
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,320
 large numbers of you don't have,

140
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
 which is you are not able to see

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,520
 and you will not see heaven.

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,800
 And so tonight, we're gonna discuss and explore

143
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,080
 how that relates to the subject of being born again

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,480
 and what it means to be born again.

145
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,600
 A question asked by our man, Nicodemus.

146
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
 We're gonna be in John chapter three.

147
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,880
 If you have a Bible, you can open there

148
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,600
 and we're really gonna look at John chapter three

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,880
 and we're also gonna trace his story

150
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,760
 throughout the rest of the book of John.

151
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,400
 So we're gonna start in verse one and I will read it

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
 and then kind of summarize.

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,400
 You guys there, everyone there?

154
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,240
 All right, if not, it's on the screen.

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,800
 Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus,

156
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,120
 who was also a member of the Jewish ruling council.

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,320
 He came to Jesus at night and said,

158
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,120
 "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher

159
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
 "who has come from God,

160
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,840
 "for no one could perform the signs that you were doing

161
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,560
 "if God was not with him."

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,400
 Jesus replied, "Very truly, I tell you,

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
 "no one can see the kingdom of God

164
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,960
 "unless they are born again."

165
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,240
 "How can someone be born when they are old?"

166
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
 Nicodemus asked.

167
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,280
 "Surely they cannot enter a second time

168
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,480
 "into their mother's womb to be born."

169
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,280
 Jesus answered, "Very truly, I tell you,

170
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,240
 "no one can enter the kingdom of God

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
 "unless they are born of water and of spirit.

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
 "Flesh gives birth to flesh

173
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
 "and spirit gives birth to spirit."

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
 So here's what just happened.

175
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,840
 So Nicodemus, this is early on in Jesus's ministry.

176
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,640
 So very early on, Jesus was doing ministry

177
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,520
 essentially for three years on the planet.

178
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,560
 Early in the game, he's doing miracles,

179
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
 he's getting a lot of people behind him,

180
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,960
 he's becoming increasingly popular.

181
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,040
 And Nicodemus, who's a Pharisee,

182
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
 Nicodemus is on Jerusalem's who's who list,

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
 that's who he is.

184
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,120
 He's not only a religious,

185
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,520
 at the top of the religious chart,

186
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,480
 which in those days, it was like,

187
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,200
 if we have baseball cards for famous people,

188
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,760
 they have like religious cards for people

189
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
 because the Pharisees were like,

190
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
 "Oh man, that's what I wanna be when I grow up."

191
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
 And so Nicodemus is not only that guy,

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,520
 but he is a member of the ruling council

193
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,840
 in terms of he's a part of the Senate that rules the city.

194
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 So he's very influential politically and religiously.

195
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,600
 He's a guy that everywhere he went,

196
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
 he has an entourage with him.

197
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,880
 And Nicodemus hears of this man, Jesus, and he's curious.

198
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,720
 So he goes to him at night,

199
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,320
 maybe so that no one else would see,

200
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,040
 no one on this Sanhedrin, that's the ruling council,

201
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,920
 would see that he goes to this man,

202
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,720
 this new rabbi on the scene,

203
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
 and he goes to him and he's sitting around

204
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,680
 a campfire with Jesus.

205
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,080
 And he begins to kind of like,

206
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,040
 walk through introductions.

207
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,520
 "Hey, I'm Nicodemus, me and my associates,

208
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,520
 "here, we know that you are clearly a good man from God,

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,800
 "we're men of God, we thought we could be friends."

210
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,200
 And Jesus, mid-sentence, cuts him off.

211
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,520
 And it's as though Jesus is like,

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,440
 "Let's get right to the point.

213
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,280
 "No one can see the kingdom of God

214
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,920
 "unless they are born again."

215
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,600
 And Nicodemus doesn't get it at all.

216
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,880
 Like he's going, "What, what are you talking about?

217
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,680
 "Born again, born again?

218
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
 "I'm supposed to crawl into my mother's womb?

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,880
 "That's a little graphic, Jesus.

220
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
 "Can't think about that too long.

221
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,720
 "What do you mean that I'm supposed to be born again?

222
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,920
 "And how can I be born again when I'm old?"

223
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
 Clearly he's not understanding.

224
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
 And we hear that and we're like,

225
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,680
 "Come on, come on, Nicodemus, it's a metaphor, buddy.

226
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,240
 "Get with the picture."

227
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
 But Nicodemus has never heard this before.

228
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,040
 So he's going, "Wait, why are you talking about my mama

229
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,680
 "and what am I supposed to do to enter the kingdom of God?"

230
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,360
 And Jesus responds, "Very truly, I tell you, no one can,"

231
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,280
 so let me explain what I mean.

232
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,360
 "Enter the kingdom of God unless they're born of water,

233
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,520
 "physical birth, and born of the Spirit.

234
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,960
 "Flesh gives birth to flesh."

235
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,040
 In other words, camels give birth to camels,

236
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,600
 dogs, dogs, humans to humans,

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,280
 but the Spirit gives birth to the Spirit,

238
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,480
 which brings us to our first point.

239
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,960
 You and I are blind without a new birth.

240
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,880
 You and I are blind without a new birth.

241
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,240
 You will not see and I will not see the kingdom of God.

242
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 And he says to Nicodemus, "You will not,

243
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,520
 "if you do not experience a new birth."

244
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,720
 And it's not a birth unlike your first birth,

245
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
 though it doesn't involve your mother,

246
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,000
 in the same way that your original birth took place,

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,920
 where flesh caused the birth of flesh,

248
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,800
 Spirit caused the birth of Spirit.

249
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,000
 Here's what I mean by that.

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
 In the same way that you were not really responsible

251
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,880
 for any part of you coming into this world,

252
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,280
 and I wasn't responsible for it,

253
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,520
 our parents brought us into this world.

254
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,280
 If you've ever seen "Pregnancy,"

255
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,840
 we have close friends right now that are pregnant,

256
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,840
 and pregnancy is such a terrible season of life for people,

257
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,040
 like morning sickness and nausea.

258
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,400
 There should be like five Mother's Days a year,

259
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,560
 because what women go through

260
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240
 to bring children into this world,

261
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,120
 and so many, preach!

262
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,400
 (congregation laughing)

263
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,440
 And so all along, the moms changing what they eat,

264
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
 and they're trying to figure out

265
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,240
 what I can eat and can't eat,

266
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,760
 and they're getting sleep adjustments,

267
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,640
 and they're trying to make all these different sacrifices

268
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,000
 to bring the kid in, and you know who does nothing

269
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,160
 to bring themselves into the world,

270
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
 or nothing in the process?

271
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
 The child.

272
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,400
 The dad barely does more,

273
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,160
 and he does the one thing that he enjoys,

274
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,960
 and so the child does very little to bring in himself,

275
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,800
 or nothing to bring himself into the world.

276
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,720
 That's what birth is.

277
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,280
 Jesus just said, "The Spirit gives birth to the Spirit."

278
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,200
 In other words, you, just like you weren't a part

279
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,000
 of your mom bringing you in, Nicodemus,

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,840
 here's how you have to be born again,

281
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,720
 and it's not a birth that you can control.

282
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
 The way you get born again is not by you trying to do more,

283
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
 it's not by some work.

284
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,840
 The only way you'll see the kingdom of God

285
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,000
 is by birth, not work, which raises the question,

286
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,720
 like how can a person be born again?

287
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
 And Nicodemus is taken back,

288
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,320
 because here's what I know, and I'm confident,

289
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
 Nicodemus is the guy.

290
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,520
 If there's a religious leader who's like,

291
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,040
 "Yeah, people come to me, and they ask questions."

292
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,120
 When you get done with the born again,

293
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
 I'll share you my opinion too, Jesus.

294
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,640
 Nicodemus is the guy who's like,

295
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,160
 "If anyone is getting into heaven, it's me."

296
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,920
 I mean, look at my resume.

297
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,880
 I am the leader of God's chosen people, the Jews.

298
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
 If anyone is leading up the charge about like,

299
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,080
 "Hey, we're God's chosen people, the Jews,

300
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,680
 "give me a J, give me an E, give me a W,"

301
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,600
 that's who we are, and I'm the one leading

302
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,080
 the pep rally from the front, Jesus.

303
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,520
 How dare you tell me that despite being in church

304
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,160
 every Sunday, reading my Bible,

305
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,120
 knowing a lot of Bible verses, being a good kid,

306
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,200
 that I'm not getting in, that I lack?

307
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,080
 And how, and what does it look like to even be born again?

308
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,320
 And Jesus is gonna answer that, verse seven.

309
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,740
 "You should not be surprised," Jesus speaking,

310
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,040
 "at my saying, you must be born again.

311
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,880
 "The wind blows wherever it pleases.

312
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,620
 "You hear the sound, but you cannot tell

313
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,380
 "where it comes from or where it is going.

314
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,700
 "So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.

315
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,960
 "How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.

316
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,060
 "You were Israel's teacher," said Jesus,

317
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,840
 "and you do not understand these things?

318
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,880
 "Very truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know,

319
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,040
 "and we testify of what we have seen,

320
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,060
 "but still you people do not accept our testimony.

321
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,680
 "I have spoken to you of earthly things,

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
 "and you do not believe.

323
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,520
 "How then will you believe if I speak to you

324
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,060
 "of heavenly things?

325
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
 "No one has ever gone into heaven,

326
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,420
 "except the one who has come from heaven, the Son of Man."

327
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,440
 Let's stop there.

328
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,680
 So what Jesus just said is basically,

329
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,400
 hey, just like, let me explain how you can know

330
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
 that you've been born again.

331
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,880
 Just like when there's a, we're sitting in front of a fire,

332
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,640
 and the fire all of a sudden,

333
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,320
 remember if you've ever been to a campfire

334
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,280
 any time recently, and you're like sitting around

335
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,680
 with your little chairs around the fire,

336
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
 and the wind will change directions,

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
 and all of a sudden you're like not in the smoke,

338
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,760
 and then all of a sudden you're like,

339
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,920
 okay, everyone shift over, and then it's again,

340
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
 and you're like, okay, shift back,

341
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,360
 and you don't know where it's gonna go next.

342
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,520
 Jesus just said, in the same way,

343
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,720
 that's what it's like in someone's life.

344
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,040
 Like you can't see the wind, but you can tell it's there.

345
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,680
 You can see the evidence of it, and he says,

346
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,140
 in the same way, you can't see the rebirth take place,

347
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,580
 but there is evidence that it's there,

348
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,040
 and he's about to give us what that is.

349
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,960
 Verse 14, "Just as Moses lifted up the snake

350
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,800
 "in the wilderness,"

351
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,200
 so what he just referenced, gosh, this is such a cool story.

352
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
 Who should have more time?

353
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,280
 So what he just referenced is a story that you and I

354
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,960
 are like, that's not my favorite story,

355
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,400
 but Nicodemus would have been well acquainted with.

356
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,560
 "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness,"

357
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,040
 what are you talking about, Jesus?

358
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,640
 "In the book of Numbers," which is in the Old Testament,

359
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 "it tells the story of the nation of Israel

360
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,480
 "traveling through the wilderness."

361
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,600
 And in one of those chapters, chapter 21,

362
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
 it lays out this one that seems like random story

363
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,200
 in the Old Testament, and here's what happened.

364
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,520
 Moses leads the people out of slavery,

365
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,120
 and they're all making camp outside in the wilderness,

366
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,880
 and everyone's set up, and they find a place

367
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,040
 they're gonna make camp, and they've got campfires going,

368
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,360
 and s'mores, and their tents all set up,

369
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,600
 and then all of a sudden, there's not s'mores,

370
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,800
 and then all of a sudden,

371
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,760
 all these snakes start coming out,

372
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,280
 and they're biting all the people.

373
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,940
 This is like "Game of Thrones" stuff.

374
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,280
 All the people, thousands, if not millions of people,

375
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,960
 are in these tents, and all of a sudden,

376
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,760
 all of these serpents come out and begin to bite the people,

377
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,040
 and the people are dying in droves.

378
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,080
 Moses runs to God, and he goes into this tent,

379
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,040
 and he goes, "God, what am I supposed to do?

380
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,080
 "Everyone's dying, there's serpents everywhere."

381
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,380
 And God says, "Here's what I want you to do.

382
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,760
 "I want you to take a pole with a crossbeam,

383
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,360
 "and I want you to put a serpent on it."

384
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,180
 Don't get bit.

385
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,640
 "And I want you to put a serpent on the crossbeam."

386
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,680
 And it's like, what, that feels really random.

387
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,360
 "Then I want you to run to the center of the camp,

388
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,840
 "and I want you to raise up the serpent

389
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,480
 "and place it in the center of the camp.

390
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,760
 "And everyone who looks at the serpent will be healed."

391
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,120
 Everyone, if you could drag your family member over there,

392
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
 and you could just point them in the direction,

393
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
 if they look at that, they will be healed.

394
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,840
 And Jesus just said, "Just like that,

395
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,760
 "so everyone," verse 15, "so the Son of Man

396
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,760
 "must be lifted up, that everyone who,"

397
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,240
 what does it look like to be born again?

398
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,740
 What's the evidence?

399
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,720
 "Believes may have eternal life."

400
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,040
 That Jesus just said that the evidence

401
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,580
 of a person being born again is that they believe,

402
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,640
 which brings us to our second point.

403
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,320
 New birth comes from new belief.

404
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,820
 What does it look like to be born again?

405
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,140
 How can I be a born again, or a person who knows

406
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,360
 that I have been born again?

407
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,200
 Which, if that's the only way to enter eternal life,

408
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,240
 I think all of us would say, "I think I'd take that door."

409
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,280
 All of us would take that, and Jesus just said,

410
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,820
 "The only way that you can be born again,

411
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,460
 "or how you can know, is if you believe,

412
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,140
 "so that everyone who believes in the Son

413
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,840
 "may have eternal life."

414
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,480
 This is how you can know you have the new birth,

415
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,020
 that Jesus, and really, the entire Gospels

416
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,360
 introduced this idea.

417
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
 The issue is not whosoever behaves.

418
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,500
 It is whosoever believes.

419
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,240
 The issue of sin is not the problem

420
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,240
 in keeping someone from experiencing eternal life.

421
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,080
 This is so huge.

422
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,840
 If you're back in church for the first time in a long time,

423
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,160
 I hope you don't miss, tune out,

424
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,120
 and count the ceiling tiles,

425
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,900
 if you miss everything else after this.

426
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,940
 The issue of you and your life,

427
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,800
 and whether or not you can have right standing with God,

428
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,140
 does not depend on sin.

429
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,360
 The issue is, do you believe?

430
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,720
 The issue is, who are you trusting in?

431
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,960
 Because if you go, "No, but I'm too bad of a person."

432
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,320
 That is you trusting in yourself,

433
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,400
 in what you have done.

434
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
 And Jesus says, "Whoever believes."

435
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,440
 The issue is, do you believe?

436
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,880
 Or do you trust?

437
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
 Who are you trusting in?

438
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,760
 Jesus said, "Whoever puts their trust in me,

439
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,680
 "the Son of Man, lifted up."

440
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,280
 That person will have eternal life.

441
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,760
 The issue is, do you believe?

442
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,200
 And John really punctuates this by giving us

443
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,040
 maybe the most famous verse in the Bible,

444
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,440
 a verse regardless of your religious background,

445
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,400
 you've probably heard before.

446
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,040
 Thanks to Tim Tebow and Austin 316,

447
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
 where it says this,

448
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
 "For God so loved,"

449
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,820
 Austin 316, haven't heard that name in a while.

450
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,440
 "For God so loved the world,

451
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,520
 "that he gave his one and only Son,

452
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,520
 "that whoever believes in him,

453
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,040
 "shall not perish, but have eternal life."

454
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,360
 What is the evidence of a person being born again

455
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,280
 that they believe?

456
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,200
 How do you know that the Spirit

457
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,040
 gives birth to spirit inside of you?

458
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,680
 Do you believe that Jesus on the cross

459
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,800
 paid for your sin?

460
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,280
 That whosoever believes,

461
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,100
 shall not perish, but have eternal life?

462
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,380
 The Bible teaches,

463
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,240
 it is not good people who go to heaven,

464
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,080
 and bad people who go to hell.

465
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,260
 It's forgiven people who go to heaven.

466
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,360
 Forgiven from who?

467
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,200
 From God.

468
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,920
 And the only way you can have forgiveness

469
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,120
 is if you will accept it.

470
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,840
 And he's offered it in the free gift

471
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,440
 that Jesus gave us when he died on a cross,

472
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,040
 and whoever puts their trust,

473
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,680
 God says, "I've given my Son,

474
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,500
 "and whoever trusts in him,

475
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,680
 "will have eternal life."

476
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,600
 They've been born again.

477
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,720
 They've been changed.

478
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,520
 And Nicodemus is having all of his categories blown,

479
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,480
 and he's going, "What?

480
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,240
 "How dare you even talk to me

481
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 "like this rabbi random guy?

482
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,640
 "I'm the Jewish leader,

483
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,760
 "the teacher of Israel.

484
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,660
 "You're telling me that I don't have

485
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,800
 "what it takes?"

486
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,120
 And he goes back to his other Sanhedrin buddies,

487
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,000
 and they're like, "How'd it go?"

488
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,120
 And he was like, "He wasn't home."

489
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,880
 And they go on in life,

490
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,760
 and Nicodemus continues to watch Jesus from afar.

491
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,080
 And the story really only gets better from there,

492
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,360
 and here's what happened next.

493
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,920
 So that's John three,

494
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,200
 and kind of the next few chapters.

495
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,760
 Jesus's ministry continues to grow,

496
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,880
 and to grow, and to grow.

497
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,280
 And the Pharisees,

498
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,380
 which is Nick and all his boys,

499
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,780
 they see Jesus and his crowd continuing,

500
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,140
 all of his fans and followers continuing to grow,

501
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,860
 and they're like, "We gotta put a stop to this."

502
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,420
 And then Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath.

503
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,820
 He tells this man who had been lame for 38 years,

504
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,860
 "I want you to get up, and I want you to walk."

505
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,580
 And the Pharisees are going,

506
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,220
 he did not just move his mat on the Sabbath.

507
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,260
 This is a game changer.

508
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,700
 We gotta get Jesus right now.

509
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,100
 So here's what they do.

510
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,660
 They get the temple guards together,

511
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,180
 and the temple guards were not like the Roman centurions.

512
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,360
 Temple guards were like the mall cops,

513
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,140
 or campus police, you know?

514
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,320
 Where you're like, "Can you arrest me?

515
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
 "Where would you take me?

516
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,560
 "Do you have a gun?

517
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,800
 "Is that a taser?"

518
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,120
 They're the guys who you're like,

519
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,760
 "I don't know if I'm off the campus.

520
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,520
 "Do you have authority out here?"

521
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,600
 That's the temple guards.

522
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,040
 They're the temple guards, but they have like spears.

523
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,200
 And so here's what happens.

524
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,820
 The Pharisees and the Sanhedrin are like,

525
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,340
 "I want you to go get Jesus.

526
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,120
 "He's gonna be at the Feast of Booths."

527
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
 The Feast of Booths, this is in John 7.

528
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,720
 So he was the man, and then this huge event

529
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,000
 called the Feast of Booths,

530
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,360
 which was a really cool event in Jewish history,

531
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
 or in Jewish celebrations.

532
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,960
 Here's what it was.

533
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,520
 The Feast of Booths was like Woodstock.

534
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,360
 It sincerely was.

535
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,700
 Everyone would get Feast of Booths or Feast of Tents,

536
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,220
 where everyone, it was a celebration, seven days,

537
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,880
 and it was the harvest, so they're drinking wine,

538
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,680
 and they're all hanging out in their tents

539
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
 outside the city.

540
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,500
 That's literally what the festival was.

541
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,620
 So everyone comes together.

542
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,420
 It was literally the biggest festival

543
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,400
 because everyone came from everywhere to be a part of it.

544
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,780
 They're like, "I am not missing that one.

545
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,860
 "I'm okay with missing the other ones,

546
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,200
 "but that one I'm gonna be a part of."

547
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,580
 So Woodstock is going on, so they know Jesus will be there.

548
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,620
 Jesus is gonna show up

549
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,380
 because there's more people in Jerusalem than ever.

550
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,380
 He's gonna show up and wanna teach.

551
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,420
 And so temple guards, we want you to go arrest him.

552
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,220
 We want you to go find him and go arrest him.

553
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,400
 And so here's what happens.

554
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,720
 The festival goes on, Jesus does show up, he's teaching,

555
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,720
 and the Pharisees in Sanhedrin are waiting,

556
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,040
 and they're going, "When is this guy

557
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,340
 "getting back with Jesus?"

558
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,980
 And then they see the guards starting to walk down the hill

559
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,100
 or walk towards the temple where they're waiting,

560
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,580
 and they say this, "Finally, the temple,"

561
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,840
 this is verse 45 of chapter seven,

562
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,920
 "Finally, the temple guards went back

563
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,660
 "to the chief priests and Pharisees,

564
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,100
 "who asked them, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'"

565
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,340
 So the temple guards come back and they don't have Jesus.

566
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,040
 And they say, "Why didn't you bring him in?"

567
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,740
 And they go, I love this,

568
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,360
 "No one has ever spoke the way this man does,"

569
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,780
 the guards replied.

570
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,800
 And the priests are going, "What, you listened to a message?

571
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,220
 "You sat there in the audience and you listened to a message?

572
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,360
 "We told you to arrest him."

573
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,060
 Yeah, but he was in the middle of an illustration.

574
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,380
 We didn't wanna interrupt.

575
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,620
 Literally, that's what happened.

576
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,060
 And they're going, "Oh my gosh, Barney Fife, you guys,

577
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,780
 "okay, we're gonna have to come up with another plan.

578
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,380
 "You mean he deceived you too?"

579
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,300
 Verse 47, "The Pharisees retorted,

580
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,860
 "Have any of the rulers of the Pharisees believed in him?

581
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,320
 "No, but this mob knows nothing of the law.

582
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,180
 "There's a curse on them."

583
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,220
 And here's our boy again.

584
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,640
 "Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier

585
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,980
 "and who was one of their number, asked,

586
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,600
 "'Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him

587
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,240
 "'to find out what he has been doing?'

588
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,620
 "And the Sanhedrin replied to him,

589
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,360
 "'Are you from Galilee too?'

590
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,060
 "Then Nicodemus appears again."

591
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,940
 And he's not totally without providing a little defense,

592
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,280
 but he's still timid and going,

593
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,600
 "Look, guys, clearly it's wrong for you to arrest him,

594
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,380
 "but maybe it's okay."

595
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,860
 And they say, "Are you from Galilee too?"

596
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,340
 And he's like, "I was just kidding."

597
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,240
 And so we continue, and here's what happens next.

598
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,780
 So the next couple chapters, Jesus,

599
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,500
 and this is really over a picture of the book of John.

600
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,480
 Jesus continues and his ministry keeps growing.

601
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,520
 And then he heals this man who had been blind.

602
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,760
 His whole life he'd been born blind, John 9.

603
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,080
 And he continues to insult or continues to buy him

604
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,680
 and his ministry growing insult these religious leaders.

605
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,600
 And then the last straw is broken in John 11

606
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,920
 with Lazarus, this man who died.

607
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,540
 Jesus shows up and he says,

608
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,720
 "Take the stone away from the tomb."

609
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,660
 And they said, "Jesus, he's been dead for four days.

610
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,720
 "It's gonna smell terrible.

611
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,340
 "Just tell him goodbye from here."

612
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,760
 And Jesus says, "Take the stone away.

613
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,080
 "Lazarus, come forward."

614
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
 And Lazarus walks out of the tomb alive.

615
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,400
 And now Jesus is like a celebrity

616
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,920
 like they've never seen before.

617
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,460
 And it literally says from that day on,

618
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,640
 they plotted we're gonna kill Lazarus and Jesus.

619
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,040
 So they get the temple guards together,

620
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,300
 and they decide, "Hey, we're gonna give you

621
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,340
 "one more shot, mall cop.

622
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,700
 "You're gonna go, we're gonna tell you exactly where he is.

623
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,320
 "We have an insider, his name is Judas.

624
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,960
 "He sold his master.

625
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,040
 "We're gonna tell you exactly where to go.

626
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,280
 "Judas is going to point out exactly who to arrest.

627
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,020
 "We want you to bring him back here.

628
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,520
 "This needs to be put to an end."

629
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,840
 And so that's exactly what happens.

630
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,400
 They go, Judas betrays him,

631
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,920
 and they arrest Jesus in the garden at night.

632
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,480
 And they bring him back.

633
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,020
 The temple guards bring him to the temple.

634
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,920
 And they have this trial, this illegal trial.

635
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,040
 Where Jesus is brought before the Sanhedrin,

636
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,680
 and he's brought, and they accuse him of blasphemy,

637
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,280
 saying, "You claim to be the son of God."

638
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,320
 And they slap him in the face, the scripture tells us.

639
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,640
 And they say, "Take it back."

640
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,400
 And Jesus says, "You've spoken it."

641
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,800
 And they rip their clothes,

642
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,000
 and they say, "This man deserves to die."

643
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,840
 But here's like the kicker.

644
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,480
 Jews couldn't crucify or couldn't execute someone.

645
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,340
 So they go, "Well, what are we gonna do?"

646
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,460
 "We're gonna take him to Pilate."

647
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,420
 Pilate's the governor, he's a Roman,

648
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,300
 he doesn't have any religion, he'll do it for us.

649
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,900
 And so we'll bring him to Pilate.

650
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,620
 So they bring him to Pilate,

651
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,100
 and they gather outside Pilate's house,

652
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,900
 and they say, "This man is a criminal

653
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,260
 "who needs to be executed."

654
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,300
 And Pilate's always seeing the Jews stirring stuff up,

655
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,180
 going, "What has he done?"

656
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,660
 And they say, "You can ask him."

657
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,020
 So Pilate brings him to not upset them,

658
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,220
 and he brings him inside, and he begins to interview him.

659
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,920
 And they say, "He claimed to be the king of the Jews.

660
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,000
 "He's not our king."

661
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,020
 And Pilate sits there, and he goes,

662
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,260
 "What have you done to make these people so angry?

663
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,400
 "Are you the king of the Jews?"

664
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,000
 And Jesus says, "My kingdom's not of this world."

665
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,400
 And Pilate's going, "So you are a king," is what he says.

666
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,820
 And Pilate's going, "Look, this guy's not deserving of death.

667
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,840
 "He may be a little woo-woo,

668
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,960
 "but he's not deserving of death."

669
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,680
 So he brings him back outside,

670
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,760
 and by this time, there's a crowd gathering

671
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,480
 outside Pilate's house.

672
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,040
 There's a crowd that's sitting there,

673
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,920
 and he says, "Look, I'm not gonna kill this guy.

674
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
 "Finally, he's a criminal.

675
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,720
 "You guys have a thing every year

676
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,520
 "where you release one criminal on Passover,

677
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,820
 "so I'm gonna let him go.

678
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,160
 "He'll be your guy."

679
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,080
 And they begin to shout in the crowd,

680
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,160
 "No, give us Barabbas.

681
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,920
 "Give us Barabbas, the rebel, the murderer.

682
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,000
 "Give us Barabbas."

683
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
 And Pilate's going, "Give you Barabbas?

684
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,300
 "This man hasn't done anything.

685
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,200
 "What should I do with him?"

686
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,620
 And then someone begins to yell, "Crucify him!

687
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,640
 "Crucify him!"

688
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,040
 And the chant begins to go,

689
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,520
 and Pilate takes him away, saying,

690
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,260
 "I'm not gonna crucify.

691
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,320
 "That's like giving lethal injection

692
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,680
 "for a speeding ticket, guys.

693
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,520
 "You don't do that.

694
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,840
 "I'm not gonna crucify."

695
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,560
 Crucifixion was only for the worst of the worst.

696
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,400
 Come on, Jesus.

697
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,680
 And he takes him back inside,

698
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,820
 and Pilate says, "You know what I'll do?

699
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,680
 "I'll just have him flogged.

700
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,020
 "I'll have his back and his body permanently disfigured,

701
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,160
 "which is what flogging was,

702
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,000
 "this whip that would go around you with knives and glass."

703
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,440
 And he says, "I'll just beat this man

704
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,300
 "into an inch of his life being taken,

705
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,880
 "and then they'll be happy and they'll be fine."

706
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,300
 So Jesus is whipped,

707
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,600
 and while the Roman centurions are whipping him,

708
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,000
 they go, "His charge is he's the king?

709
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,320
 "Well, let's make him a crown."

710
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,960
 And they form this thorn, or this crown of thorns,

711
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,440
 and they put a robe, a purple robe over him.

712
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,300
 And Jesus, covered in his own blood,

713
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,620
 stumbles out, blood coming from his forehead,

714
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,380
 and Pilate says, "Take your king away."

715
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,380
 And the chant continues.

716
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,080
 "Crucify him, he's not our king.

717
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,020
 "Crucify him."

718
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,900
 And then someone in the crowd says this,

719
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,540
 "You are no friend of Caesar's if you don't kill this king.

720
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,020
 "Anyone who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's,

721
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,620
 "and if you're a friend of Jesus,

722
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,700
 "you are no friend of Caesar's."

723
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,840
 And Pilate knows that's game over,

724
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,720
 because if I support and allow this man to go free,

725
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,960
 they're gonna say, "I'm not a friend of Caesar.

726
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,480
 "That's the only friend that I have."

727
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,640
 And so he says, "Take him away, crucify him."

728
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,120
 The disciples flee, they don't go see the crucifixion.

729
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,000
 Only John.

730
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,840
 And then John records something really

731
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,080
 you wouldn't have thought.

732
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,020
 That happens next.

733
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,940
 Jesus is brought there and he's crucified.

734
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,120
 And he's nailed to a cross,

735
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,880
 and then a few hours later he dies.

736
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,300
 And this is what's recorded about his burial.

737
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,900
 Later, Joseph of Arimathea,

738
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,980
 who was a member of the Sanhedrin,

739
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,220
 Luke and all the other gospels tell us,

740
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,980
 asked Pilate for the body of Jesus,

741
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,300
 which was really unusual.

742
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,240
 Crucified men were not buried.

743
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,280
 They were left on the cross for birds to pick at them,

744
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,240
 and Joseph, this Sanhedrin member,

745
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,280
 did it because here's why.

746
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,400
 Joseph was a disciple of Jesus,

747
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,840
 but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders,

748
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,760
 with Pilate's permission,

749
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,440
 he came and he took the body away,

750
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,340
 but he wasn't alone.

751
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,020
 He was accompanied by Nicodemus.

752
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,400
 The man who would come and visited Jesus at night.

753
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,560
 Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,

754
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,160
 about 75 pounds.

755
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,800
 That was a very enormous amount.

756
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,120
 Nicodemus gave him a burial like a king.

757
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,040
 Nicodemus comes with this man,

758
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,120
 and they take the body.

759
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,580
 Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it

760
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,320
 with spices and in strips of linen.

761
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,500
 This was in accordance with Jewish buriable customs.

762
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,960
 Nicodemus and Joseph, who were members of the Sanhedrin,

763
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,880
 they come and they see the body

764
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,620
 of this man who was murdered.

765
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,440
 A man who'd done nothing wrong, but healed the sick,

766
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,220
 give sight to the blind,

767
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,680
 allow lame people to walk, heal lepers,

768
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,040
 and they see him murdered.

769
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,580
 And Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea,

770
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,000
 a change takes place,

771
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,160
 and they decide we're leaving the Sanhedrin.

772
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,600
 We know that we risk dying for taking this man's body

773
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,640
 and burying him.

774
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
 We're gonna go take him, and we're gonna bury him.

775
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
 Men did not bury.

776
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,040
 Women were the ones who would bury bodies.

777
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,720
 But they say, it's fine with me.

778
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,800
 I'm leaving this.

779
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,760
 Nicodemus came to believe,

780
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,240
 and he decided I can no longer be Nick at night.

781
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,440
 I'm now becoming Nick during the day,

782
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,920
 during any time of life.

783
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,480
 I'm gonna become Nick, who comes,

784
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,840
 and my Lord and Savior died on that cross,

785
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,840
 and just with Joseph, I'm gonna take this body,

786
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,680
 and I'm gonna bury it.

787
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,580
 And they take the body down from the cross,

788
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,980
 and they pull the nails out.

789
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,200
 And they carry his body,

790
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,780
 and they get the blood of Jesus on them.

791
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,520
 And they wrap it, and they put it in a tomb.

792
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,320
 And we know by almost all accounts,

793
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,640
 Nicodemus lost everything for doing so.

794
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,880
 He would have been removed from the Sanhedrin.

795
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,360
 He would have been made unclean.

796
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,280
 He couldn't celebrate Passover that weekend.

797
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,840
 Everything had changed for him,

798
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,400
 and Nicodemus didn't care because he said, I'm going.

799
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,680
 I believe this man is who he said he was.

800
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,080
 Some point between then, it changed.

801
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,640
 Nicodemus changed.

802
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,800
 And Nick at night was no longer the same.

803
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,360
 And here's what happened.

804
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,440
 I love this.

805
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,480
 Nicodemus standing there with Joseph,

806
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
 and who knows how many others,

807
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,080
 Jesus' own disciples weren't there as he's dying.

808
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,360
 And he sees this man

809
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,940
 who had done only helpful,

810
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,420
 only set people free, only restored life.

811
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,640
 And he sees him raised up on a cross.

812
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,560
 And all of a sudden it clicked,

813
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,560
 just as the serpent was raised up on that cross

814
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,200
 that whoever looks at him would be saved.

815
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,720
 So the Son of Man must be raised up

816
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,120
 that whoever trusts in him shall not perish,

817
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,160
 but have eternal life.

818
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,520
 And everything clicked.

819
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,340
 Nick realized it's always been about Jesus.

820
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,840
 The whole story of the Old Testament,

821
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,460
 including the serpent, it's always been about Jesus.

822
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,280
 And all of a sudden in his mind, everything changed.

823
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,020
 And he knew that even though believing and following Jesus

824
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,400
 would cost me in this life, it'll cost me a job,

825
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,040
 it'll cost me my home, it'll cost me my income,

826
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,200
 not following Jesus will cost me far more

827
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
 in this life and the next.

828
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,240
 And whatever it costs me, I'm going to follow this man.

829
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,360
 Just as the Son of Man raised up,

830
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,600
 and everything changed.

831
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,680
 And he became a believer.

832
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:37,880
 This brings us to the third point of our new behavior,

833
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,080
 his birth, excuse me, from new belief.

834
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,400
 New behavior, his birth from his new belief.

835
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,760
 And standing on a hillside,

836
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,120
 this man who knew every text in the Old Testament

837
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,920
 about the God and the Messiah who would one day come

838
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,560
 and be pierced for our transgressions,

839
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,800
 crushed for our iniquity,

840
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,420
 all of a sudden they all came into focus.

841
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,280
 It's always been about Jesus.

842
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,640
 It will always be about Jesus.

843
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
 It's all about Jesus.

844
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,220
 And he went from skeptic to believer.

845
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:20,220
 I think, really what he did is,

846
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,480
 I was out walking not long ago,

847
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,400
 and I was walking with my dog.

848
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,960
 Another dog story, here we go.

849
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,720
 (congregation laughing)

850
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,240
 And I see this stray dog, and of course,

851
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,480
 and of course I'm like, oh man.

852
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,800
 And I think it's my neighbor's dog.

853
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,840
 I think I'm like almost positive.

854
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,820
 Oh, that's my neighbor's dog.

855
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,000
 I need to go return it, okay?

856
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,320
 So I go over, give the dog.

857
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,160
 I'm like, great, let's go.

858
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,320
 We're gonna take you home to Bobby.

859
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,320
 And I get over to Bobby's house in his backyard,

860
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,760
 and his dog's looking back at me.

861
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
 And I'm like, who are you?

862
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,160
 And it wasn't his dog.

863
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,800
 And so I bend down, and I look,

864
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,160
 and I'm like, oh, okay, I have a number,

865
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,480
 and I'm gonna call him.

866
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,600
 And I begin to call his owner.

867
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,280
 And all of a sudden, we live in like Old Lake Highlands.

868
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,760
 I'm walking back home, calling the owner.

869
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,800
 Hey, I think I found your dog.

870
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,640
 A storm like I've never seen before in my life,

871
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,160
 including last night, in the last 30 days.

872
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,400
 (congregation laughing)

873
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,480
 A storm like I've never seen in my entire life

874
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,760
 all of a sudden comes out of nowhere,

875
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,360
 and there's wind blowing.

876
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,400
 Trees are snapping.

877
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,960
 Power lines are coming down.

878
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,640
 Boxes of trash, I promise you,

879
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,160
 it's gonna sound like, you're a preacher.

880
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,200
 You're exaggerating.

881
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,120
 I promise I'm not.

882
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,720
 There's boxes flying everywhere.

883
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,360
 And I'm with my dog, and I'm like, oh my gosh,

884
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,160
 we gotta go, every dog for himself.

885
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,560
 So we take off, and we go run back to my house.

886
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
 And we're running to the house.

887
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,760
 All the power's out everywhere.

888
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,160
 It's at night, and I finally, I run into the door,

889
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,360
 and I'm waiting, and my dog comes in behind me,

890
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,680
 and I slam the door shut.

891
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,280
 And all of a sudden, I hear this collar.

892
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,400
 That's not mine.

893
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
 And it's the other dog in the house.

894
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,720
 And I'm like, how did you get here?

895
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,160
 And he's like, hey buddy, holla at your boy.

896
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
 I'm coming with you.

897
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,680
 And he's in, I promise, it sounds like my wife,

898
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,080
 I've told this story before, my wife's like,

899
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,160
 are you embellishing?

900
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,840
 I promise, that's what happened.

901
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,160
 And so looking at this dog, and it really,

902
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
 here's what happened.

903
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,760
 Like that dog essentially was like, look, I'm no fool.

904
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,840
 I'm going with you, bro.

905
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,080
 You're the only chance of protection I have.

906
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,280
 You're the only chance of life and safety I have.

907
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,760
 I'm not staying out here on my own.

908
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,660
 I'm not gonna make it on my own, and I'm coming with you.

909
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:28,560
 Nicodemus essentially realized what all of us will realize

910
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,600
 in this life or the next.

911
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,760
 Jesus is the only chance of protection that you and I have.

912
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,560
 All of us have sinned, the Bible said,

913
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,520
 and by sin, it's both mistakes and more than that.

914
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,640
 All of us have made decisions in our past,

915
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,080
 in our present, and will in our future,

916
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,960
 where we go, that was wrong.

917
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,280
 I don't think that's right.

918
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,600
 All of us have fallen short, the Bible says,

919
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,280
 and it says the only chance of protection

920
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,300
 that you and I have is found at the same shadow

921
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,040
 of that cross that Nicodemus went to and found protection.

922
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,220
 The only chance of life that you and I share

923
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,060
 is found there.

924
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,620
 Ironically, the story of Pilate,

925
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,360
 like how great of a tragedy is this?

926
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,480
 He's standing eyeball to eyeball

927
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,280
 with the God of the universe,

928
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,360
 and he was wondering, and it takes him several times,

929
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,640
 he goes back into that house,

930
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,900
 and he knows there's something unique about this man,

931
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,460
 but he never left from wonderer.

932
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,160
 He never left from I'm intrigued, he stayed there,

933
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
 unlike Nicodemus, who went from wonderer to believer.

934
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,720
 He went from the man who said, no, I'm a good person,

935
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,000
 do I need someone to pay for my sin?

936
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,600
 When that cross came lifted up, he looked at his Savior,

937
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,280
 and everything changed.

938
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,920
 And my fear for some of you in this room

939
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,680
 is that you're gonna stay a wanderer,

940
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,040
 you're gonna stay like the tragedy that Pilate was.

941
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,760
 Maybe because you don't think you're a good enough person,

942
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,520
 maybe because you think that God can't love you

943
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,480
 based on your path, all of which

944
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,520
 are examples of trusting in yourself.

945
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,320
 And he says, will you come and trust in me?

946
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,920
 Come, I paid for it.

947
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,720
 Will you come to the only one who can give you protection

948
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 and life, the one that whoever believes in

949
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,960
 will not perish, but have eternal life?

950
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,460
 And you can have that tonight.

951
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,680
 You can know that no matter what comes your way,

952
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
 you will spend eternity with your maker.

953
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,440
 You will spend eternity in paradise.

954
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,760
 And he offers that to you.

955
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,480
 If you'll just trust and just believe.

956
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,040
 I love the story of Nicodemus,

957
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,600
 and here's why, and I'll close with this.

958
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,160
 Because I'm so much like Nicodemus.

959
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,160
 Like I have a background of being like the church kid

960
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,000
 and religious rules, and when I read the New Testament,

961
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,280
 sometimes I see like the Pharisee, the religious,

962
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,560
 gets such a bad rap that I wonder, can God love me?

963
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,600
 Which you may go, that's crazy.

964
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,640
 But the story of Nicodemus reminds me that God says,

965
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,400
 no matter who you are, no matter what you've done,

966
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,080
 no matter how bad you are, how good you think you are,

967
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,160
 I can save.

968
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,800
 If you come to me, experience the new birth

969
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,240
 that starts with a new belief

970
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,360
 and a new trust that I've paid for it.

971
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,240
 Will you come to me and find the only source of protection

972
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,720
 and the only source of life that any of us have,

973
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,320
 and you'll see that in this life

974
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,560
 on a day where it's too soon.

975
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
 I'm gonna pray that you would come tonight.

976
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
 In fact, I wanna invite you,

977
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,120
 if you're in the room during this last song

978
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,480
 and you're not sure where you stand with God,

979
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,880
 don't blow me off right now.

980
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,560
 I wanna invite you to pray where you are.

981
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,640
 You don't have to raise a hand,

982
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,940
 you don't have to come down front and tell us.

983
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,800
 I want you to invite you to pray where you are, God.

984
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,140
 I am a great sinner.

985
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,740
 I'm trusting that I have a great savior in your son.

986
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,760
 If it's true that there's a gift of eternal life

987
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,680
 totally for free, God, I'm trusting that that

988
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,440
 will have to be enough,

989
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,640
 that the payment you made on the cross is enough.

990
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
 And during this last song, if you'll just begin to pray that

991
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,240
 and it's the best decision you can make

992
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,740
 and you can leave here if you trust that,

993
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,320
 not by saying some magic words,

994
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,160
 but if you trust and believe that Jesus paid for it,

995
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,680
 you can leave here knowing

996
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,340
 that you have the only source of protection

997
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,260
 from the penalty of sin, the only source of life,

998
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,060
 and this one and the next there will ever be.

999
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,820
 I'm gonna pray that we do that.

1000
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,660
 Father, we love you.

1001
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,300
 Thank you for the story of Nicodemus.

1002
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,900
 Thank you that you don't give up on us

1003
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,400
 no matter what our story is,

1004
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,140
 that you offer a new life to all of us

1005
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,020
 no matter what we've done,

1006
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,820
 no matter who we think we are, that you love us.

1007
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,300
 I pray now for my friends in the room

1008
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,660
 who don't know you, Lord,

1009
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,140
 who aren't born again

1010
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,540
 and they're gonna spend eternity away from you.

1011
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,260
 And you've already proved you love them.

1012
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,880
 You gave your son who changed the world,

1013
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
 who reset the calendar,

1014
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,120
 who offers eternal life, so just trust him.

1015
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,560
 Would you by the Spirit give birth to the Spirit now

1016
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,480
 inside of my friends who don't have that spiritual rebirth?

1017
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,680
 We love you, amen.
