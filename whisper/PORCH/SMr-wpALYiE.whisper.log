[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:29.440]   - My life before Christ was a pursuit of happiness
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.680]   that always left me wanting more.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.020]   Growing up and all throughout high school and college,
[00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.720]   culture defined what I thought and believed.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.560]   Music, TV, and movies all told me
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.120]   that happiness can be found in having the perfect beach body,
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   dating the guy everyone else wanted,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.380]   having lots of money,
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.820]   and living the spring break lifestyle all year round,
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.240]   which was easy since I grew up in Florida.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.640]   So I chased those things.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.560]   And in college, I found myself drinking nearly every night,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.560]   working at a club in downtown Orlando,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.160]   and finding identity in what people thought about me,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.480]   especially the guys I would date.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.560]   At times, I felt happy.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.520]   I even convinced myself I was living the dream.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.920]   But as morning broke,
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.560]   and the high of this world faded as it always did,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.440]   I wondered why none of it was ever enough.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.280]   During college, I went to Las Vegas on a girls' trip
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.840]   and met a guy who the world would consider prince charming.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.400]   It made sense to me that the one thing I was missing
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.680]   to make my life feel complete was a husband like him.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.720]   I thought to myself, this is it.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.120]   He is the missing link.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.000]   So two days after graduating college,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.560]   I packed my bags and moved to Seattle where he lived
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.300]   in hopes of fulfilling my pursuit of happiness.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.560]   After moving to Seattle,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.520]   I soon realized that I had everything I thought
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   would make me happy,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.680]   but it still didn't feel like I was enough.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.640]   I still felt so empty.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.360]   Life became dull and repetitive.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880]   With nothing this world had to offer
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.320]   being able to satisfy me,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.660]   I started getting anxiety and panic attacks
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.520]   that were mentally and emotionally paralyzing.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.680]   My heart racing, sweaty palms,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.800]   feeling really lightheaded,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.000]   and a fear of impending doom would rush over me.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660]   I started attending church in hopes to find relief.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.800]   I went to church as a kid and I knew about Jesus
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   and how he had died for my sins.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.260]   I even called myself a Christian,
[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.880]   but I was not following Christ.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.960]   I was following the world.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.400]   One day at church, I heard a story from the Bible
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.340]   about how even demons acknowledge that Jesus is Lord.
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.080]   Demons believe in Jesus.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.460]   For weeks, that thought raced through my mind.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.640]   I would think about it often
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.240]   and eventually came to the conclusion
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.280]   that I was not a believer just because I said I was.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.100]   Through many encounters with God's word and his people,
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.720]   I ended up surrendering my life to Christ.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.320]   I turned from my sin and my pursuit of happiness
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.400]   and trusted in him.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.240]   During that time, a friend sent me a podcast from the porch
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.840]   and as I listened, I realized Christianity
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.880]   wasn't just a thing you do on Sundays.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.940]   It's something that informs every decision that you make.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.320]   Through listening to the porch messages,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.720]   I began to learn what it looks like to follow Christ
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.000]   and it changed everything about my life,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.440]   my playmates, my playgrounds, even where I lived.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.880]   I applied and was accepted to the Watermark Residency Program
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.320]   and am now serving in the very ministry
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.100]   that Jesus used to capture my heart.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.160]   Before Christ, I followed what the world said
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.040]   would make me happy and was left empty-handed.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.760]   Knowing Christ, I gave up everything I had to follow him
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.100]   and found more joy than ever before.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.280]   Now, my identity cannot be shaken
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.200]   because it is secure in Christ.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.000]   I no longer have to question who I am.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.300]   I am a daughter of God and an heir to his eternal kingdom.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.080]   My past sin does not defy me
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.540]   and my future sin cannot separate me from his love.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.640]   Because of Christ, I am set free
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.320]   from my pursuit of happiness
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.440]   and I have true joy in the Lord.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.580]   It is finished.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.980]   (congregation applauding)
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.320]   (congregation cheering)
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.220]   Roll up my sleeves for this one.
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.300]   You guys ever been stuck?
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.820]   Stuck in life, like you just,
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.980]   you feel like you can't go forward,
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.920]   like kind of spiritually apathetic,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.660]   continuing to beat your head against the same walls,
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.420]   like a dog to his vomit, as the Proverbs say,
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.860]   you continue to return to the same sins,
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.820]   wanting freedom but can't get it.
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.260]   I love Elena's story.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.220]   That when she moved over in that driver's seat
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.260]   and God came in and God consumed her life,
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.020]   everything changed, it's been real,
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.000]   it's been a lot of fun for me to have a front row seat
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.620]   for the second part of that story
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.380]   that she just shared with you guys.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.380]   Growing up, my family, we would vacation
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.980]   in a place at the beach called Port Aransas.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.760]   Anybody ever been to Port Aransas?
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.220]   It's kind of beach-ish, it's kind of beach.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.500]   And my dad, we grew up on a farm
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.020]   and so my dad had this big extended cab,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.160]   long bed Chevrolet pickup truck
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.740]   that he would use to pull a trailer.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.500]   And so it had a, it was a standard, it was a stick shift.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.660]   And we would, the cool thing about Port A
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.180]   is you could drive on the beach,
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.260]   you could drive in the sand,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.280]   a lot of places you can't do that,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.300]   but we would go there,
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.260]   this is where we would vacation as a family
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.340]   and you could drive on the beach.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.740]   And so one of my favorite things to do
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.100]   was take my dad's truck up and down that beach,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.300]   but there was one problem with that,
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.420]   there was just something about maneuvering that standard,
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.900]   maneuvering that stick shift,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.540]   that and I just didn't get along.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.620]   And so I would always get stuck on the beach.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.420]   This happened multiple times, not just once or twice,
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.940]   many, many times I would get stuck
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.860]   in his truck on that beach.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.700]   And so I can remember very vividly
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.420]   being me in the driver's seat, my buddy with me,
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.220]   and just like, oh no, like you kind of,
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.340]   the wheels start spinning.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.500]   And so I would, you know, shift into first
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.940]   and throw sand everywhere and then shift into reverse,
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.420]   throw sand everywhere and like, just wasn't going anywhere.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.580]   And the more I try to get unstuck,
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.820]   eventually I just buried the axle.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.540]   Like we weren't going anywhere.
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.020]   And so that, this is like in my shame now, you know,
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.660]   probably about an hour later,
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.900]   my buddy gets out of the truck
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.380]   and he goes to get my dad
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.300]   at whatever hotel we're staying at there along the beach.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.220]   And then my, and I can remember this
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.160]   would happen every time.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.300]   My dad would come, he'd open the driver's side door,
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.340]   he'd say, scoot over.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.180]   Big guy, you know, and then he would just shift into reverse,
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.300]   give it some gas, shift into first and just pull out.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.580]   And I was like, how did you do that?
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.600]   It was like magic.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.440]   And he would always do it.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.540]   And I just like, I don't understand.
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.500]   Like, how did you do that?
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.380]   I've just spent the last hour trying to get unstuck
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.860]   only to get more stuck.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.740]   And then all of a sudden when he comes in the driver's seat,
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.260]   he just pulls right out.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.820]   And I share that with you
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.280]   because some of you came in tonight feeling stuck.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.100]   There's really three categories
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.540]   of people in the room right now.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.940]   There's this category of folks who are experiencing
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.420]   the fullness of life that Jesus Christ comes to offer.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.140]   They're not the naive ones.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.020]   They are the blessed ones.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.240]   They are the ones that figured something out
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.580]   that a lot of us haven't figured out yet.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.140]   And then there's some others of us
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.860]   that continue to beat our head against the wall
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.740]   and we're kind of white knuckling this thing.
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   And we're trying to get unstuck
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.700]   and we're just burying the actual.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.980]   And we realize it, but we don't know what to do.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.220]   And we're just continuing to try to beat,
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.060]   you know, try to get unstuck,
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.580]   but we're beating our heads against the same wall.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.820]   And then there's those of you,
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.220]   there's another category of folks
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.820]   who are doing the wrong things and delighting in it.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.600]   You're like, I don't really care.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.680]   Like, give me a little bit of God on Tuesdays,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.520]   maybe on Sundays, and then let me have my freedom
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.600]   with the rest of my life.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.320]   I'm going to do what I want to do.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.960]   And so this evening, I wanna speak
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.600]   to all three of those categories
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   as the Apostle Paul teaches us from this book of Romans.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.120]   We're in a series now, Romans 8, if you want to turn there.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.460]   We're gonna be looking at verses 5 through 13
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.120]   in Romans chapter 8.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.460]   And we've entitled this Romans 8, Walk by the Spirit.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.540]   And last week, David just did a great job
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.960]   of talking about what it looks like
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.960]   to live a life of independence to the Spirit of God.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.360]   And I want to elaborate on this tonight,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.480]   letting the Spirit of God drive your life.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.940]   Who is in the driver's seat of your life?
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.920]   Is it you?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.460]   Is it God?
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.560]   Is it your flesh?
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.160]   Do you do what you wanna do when you wanna do it?
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.040]   Or is it God, the creator of the heavens and the earth?
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.360]   Who is in the driver's seat of your life?
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.900]   And so we're just gonna talk about tonight
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.720]   how one, the flesh and the Spirit are fighting for your mind.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   Two, who wins will determine where you go.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.080]   And three, before you leave here this evening,
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.240]   I want to admonish you, exhort you to decide now
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.980]   who will drive your life.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.820]   And I think the reason this is so important this evening
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.180]   is because you cannot have a full life
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.860]   without an understanding of this message.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.580]   You cannot experience the full spiritual life
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.020]   that God desires for you if you do not understand
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.440]   what this message this evening teaches.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.040]   And so I think we need to reevaluate who is driving.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.900]   Let's go.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.800]   Verse five.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.140]   Those who live according to the flesh.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.620]   Now that word, the flesh, that's just not a term
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.660]   that we use often outside of church.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.980]   And so what is that?
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.900]   That is your sin nature.
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.480]   The flesh, this word right here means
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.040]   the part of you that loves to sin.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.540]   This is the part of you that hates authority.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.940]   This is the part of you that hates accountability.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.960]   This is the part of you that wants to hide
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.180]   those things that you do on the weekend.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.220]   This is the part of you that does not want to talk
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.820]   to your community group about those types of things.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.380]   This is the part of you that loves to sin.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.060]   And this part of you has, your mind has their mindset
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.420]   on what the flesh desires.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.000]   It only cares about what it wants.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   But those who live in accordance with the spirit
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.660]   have their mindset on what the spirit desires.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.380]   Spirit there is God's spirit.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.860]   It's the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost,
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.440]   a person of the Trinity.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.060]   The mind governed by the flesh is death.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.140]   But the mind governed by the spirit is life and peace.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.860]   The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.460]   The mind governed by the flesh hates God.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.300]   The part of you that loves to sin does not like the one
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.220]   who has the rules that lead to life.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.180]   The part of you that loves to sin wants to be free from God.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.580]   It's hostile to God.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.140]   It wants to do what it wants to do,
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.620]   whatever it wants to do it.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.840]   It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.060]   Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.900]   When you live according to the flesh, you cannot please God.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.580]   And you say, well, maybe I can do good
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.100]   when I live according to the flesh.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.180]   You doing good with the wrong motive is not good, it's bad.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.620]   First Corinthians 13 says, if I do all of these things,
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.740]   but I don't do them for the right motive, it's for nothing.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.340]   And so you doing good with the wrong heart,
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.580]   you doing good not to please God,
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.160]   even you doing good to please man is sin.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.360]   And so my first point this evening is,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.400]   there is a fight for the driver's seat of your mind.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.700]   Paul is writing to us, talking about the mind
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.820]   and where it goes.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.420]   And there's this kind of dichotomy going on.
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.060]   The flesh wants to drive, but the spirit wants to drive.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.500]   There's a battle over your mind.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.660]   You can picture this.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.500]   And I want you to listen.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.820]   If the enemy can win the mind of a man,
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.780]   he can keep him from the pleasures of God.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.620]   Let me say that again.
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.940]   If the enemy can win the mind of a man,
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.180]   he can keep him from the pleasures of God.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.740]   But if a person's mind belongs to the Lord,
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.560]   so does the entire person.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.780]   If God has your mind, then he has your life.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.660]   He has you.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.340]   And so there's these two drivers
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.100]   at war with the natural human.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.220]   Two drivers fighting for the will.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.220]   One is the flesh.
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.300]   That's the one that desires to kill you,
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.140]   to take you off a cliff, to send you to a despair.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.740]   Listen, I don't have to prove this to you.
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.980]   Think about people who do whatever they want to do,
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.100]   whenever they want to do it.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.960]   They are some of the most dysfunctional people
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.120]   you'll ever meet and the least godly.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   Do you hear me?
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.940]   I mean, these are the types of people
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.660]   reality shows are made out of,
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.860]   because we are entertained by how comedic
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.900]   and sad their life is.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.540]   People who do whatever they want to do
[00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.320]   are some of the most desperate, despairing people
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.740]   you will ever meet and the least godly
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.580]   and the most dysfunctional.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.740]   See, the flesh, your flesh right now,
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.380]   the sinful nature of you, the sinful part of you,
[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.580]   the part of you that loves to sin,
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.900]   desires to feed itself.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.900]   It is excited at the opportunity to do wrong.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.460]   Let me explain.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.460]   Do you remember, my parents would travel sometimes.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.840]   You know, when I was in high school,
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.940]   they would go on vacation together
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.420]   and they'd leave me at home by myself, which was crazy,
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.140]   but they would leave me at home by myself
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.200]   and I can remember just when that door would shut
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.380]   with them on the other side of it
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.780]   and them driving down the road,
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.940]   knowing they were gonna be gone for a weekend
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.020]   and just like, it's on.
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.740]   I can now do whatever I want to do,
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.140]   which is really to say I can feed my flesh party.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.180]   It's on and so maybe that wasn't you,
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.420]   but maybe it was when you went to college.
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.340]   You get to college, parents drop you off, right?
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.340]   You've got all of your belongings in a suitcase
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.380]   and a twin size mattress and there you are
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.260]   in your dorm room or some apartment
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.420]   with your ficus tree and nothing else
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:19.420]   and you're like, oh my goodness, freedom at last.
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.900]   Like I can do whatever I want to do.
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.020]   That is the excitement of your flesh
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.740]   at the opportunity to do wrong.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.540]   Or maybe you've gone to Vegas like Elena
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.380]   and you get off that plane and you're like,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.600]   what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.500]   and in a moment at your fingertips is money,
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.820]   is gambling, is prostitution, is alcohol, is party
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.500]   and it's just that like, we're here, baby.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.980]   That's your flesh.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.540]   That's the part of you that desires to kill you.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.500]   Maybe you don't need Vegas.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.140]   Maybe you're just out in Dallas
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.840]   or maybe you're out in Fort Worth.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.900]   You're there at Sundance Square or maybe you're in Uptown
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.540]   and you're thinking, okay man, Friday night it's on
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.740]   or maybe it's Monday and all you can think about is Friday.
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.140]   That's the part of your flesh that desires to kill you.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.220]   It's a little bit unsettling
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.100]   if you think about it for too long.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.540]   Or maybe you travel for work
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.100]   and you get off that plane in some other city
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.700]   and you're like, no one really even knows
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.740]   where I am right now.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:27.180]   I can do whatever I wanna do and you call it freedom.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.620]   But what Paul is saying is, no,
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.180]   it's not just freedom from the rules.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.500]   It's freedom from integrity.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.580]   And what it really is, it's freedom to forget about God.
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.840]   And if you keep pursuing the freedom to forget about God,
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.540]   you're not gonna remember God any longer
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.860]   until you meet him in the afterlife.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.460]   This is the hostility toward God that our flesh pursues.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:57.900]   But the spirit, God's Holy Spirit,
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.340]   verse six, gives life and peace.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.380]   See, allowing the spirit to drive is not optional
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.620]   for this full spiritual life.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.860]   It is absolutely mandatory.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:16.260]   Without the spirit driving, your spiritual life is dying.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.640]   It's like trying to go on a road trip
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.220]   with an empty tank of gas.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.080]   Like you may be able to run on fumes for just a few miles,
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.820]   but pretty soon you're gonna be dead
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.220]   on the side of the road.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.660]   This is what it's like trying to pursue God
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.980]   without allowing the spirit, God's Holy Spirit,
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.220]   to drive your life.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.240]   And so God, he's not trying to keep something from you.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.460]   God's not trying to rip you off.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.180]   God wants to set you free.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.340]   God's not trying to keep that guy from you in Seattle.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.200]   He's not trying to keep that job from you.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.140]   He's not trying to keep you from going out
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.560]   with all of those friends.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.740]   He's trying to show you a path of freedom.
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.880]   He doesn't want you to die.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.760]   He doesn't want your flesh to take you off a cliff.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.100]   See, some of you, you're here tonight,
[00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.360]   you've got one foot in the church
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.760]   and one foot in the world,
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.380]   and you've got the worst of both worlds.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.800]   Like you're going like this.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.900]   Your life's a train wreck.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.540]   You're swerving all over the road.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.960]   You're like, "Oh, give me a little bit of church
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.240]   "and a little bit of the party."
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.000]   And it hasn't worked out for anyone
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.280]   in the history of history.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.420]   I've tried it, believe me.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.120]   I've talked to a lot of you who've tried it.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:29.240]   I've never talked to the person like,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.580]   "No, man, I got one foot in the church,
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.420]   "one foot in the world.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.440]   "It's working like a champ, man.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.720]   "It's working great, it's going great for me."
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.980]   No, it never works.
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.320]   You're swerving all over the road.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.400]   You look in the rear view mirror
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.160]   and there's just a pileup of cars,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.800]   and the only bad driver on the road is you.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.900]   'Cause there's a fight for the steering wheel.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:52.040]   See, letting your flesh drive is not just a bad idea,
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.300]   it's suicidal.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.520]   It's suicidal to your spiritual life.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.040]   It's suicidal to everything that God desires for you.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:07.400]   The other night, I've got a three-year-old at home right now,
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.200]   Weston, my son, and he was sick.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.760]   So he was just crying hysterically all night,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.840]   really out of character for him.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.600]   He's a pretty happy dude, but this particular night,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.920]   he's just screaming his head off,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.720]   like that hyperventilating crying.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.760]   So we eventually go up there.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.080]   I don't think he's going back to sleep, babe.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.200]   And so I go up there and I pull him out,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.760]   and I'm like, "Buddy, it's gonna be okay."
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.320]   He will not calm down.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.800]   And I'm like, I'm desperate 'cause I'm tired.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.480]   I'm like, I don't even, I just feel completely out of it.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.720]   I'm holding him, I'm like, "Buddy, you just need to stop."
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.640]   And he won't stop.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.840]   And so, and don't judge me for this, okay?
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.640]   It was like parenting low moment, but I go to bribery.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.640]   I'm like, "Hey, buddy, I will buy you a remote-control car
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.880]   "if you stop."
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.800]   And the truth is I wanted a remote-control car,
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.080]   and this was just like an excuse to get it,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   but I'm like, okay.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.560]   And it worked, like clockwork, again, don't judge me,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.400]   but it worked.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.600]   I mean, he stopped.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.160]   He's like, "What color?"
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.440]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.540]   I'm like, "All right."
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.960]   He's like, "I want a red and gray one, Daddy."
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.800]   I'm like, "Okay."
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.000]   And so he goes back to sleep,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.040]   sleeps all through the night.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.800]   I wake up the next day, I'm like, I tell Monica,
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.560]   I'm like, "Hey, I gotta buy Weston a remote-control car."
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.480]   She's like, "Like the one you wanted?"
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.680]   I'm like, "Exactly, the one I..."
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.000]   And so I go to the hobby shop.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.360]   I'm like, "Okay, you know, I'm new to the game."
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.880]   He's like, "Well, what are you looking for?"
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.920]   I'm like, "Red and gray."
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.600]   And so they have one red and gray when I leave with it.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.360]   And so we go home and I'm driving.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.380]   I mean, he's just ecstatic, you know?
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.920]   And so we're driving it, and I mean,
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.200]   these things have evolved.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.880]   Like, I don't know when the last time you played
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.160]   with a remote-control car is, but the game has changed, man.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.320]   I mean, it goes 30 miles an hour
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.720]   and just does all this crazy stuff.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.880]   I'm like, "This is awesome."
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.920]   And so I'm driving, and the whole time he's like,
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.240]   "Daddy, let me drive, Daddy, let me drive,
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.320]   "Daddy, let me drive, Daddy."
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.240]   I'm like, "What do you think, it's yours?"
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.080]   You know?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.320]   And so anyways, and so he just keeps saying that.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.880]   And so eventually, you know, I get weak
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.160]   and I hand him the remote-control car.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.440]   When he takes it, it takes about three seconds
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.360]   for him to hammer the gas and drive it 30 miles an hour
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.760]   directly into the curb.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.940]   You know, cars in pieces, okay?
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.440]   And so I go and I get it,
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.420]   and I kind of piece it back together,
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.760]   and I make it drivable again.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.040]   And then I'm driving it, and I'm, you know,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.200]   showing him everything that it can do.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.400]   And he's like, "Let me drive, let me drive,
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.880]   "let me drive, let me drive, let me drive."
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.120]   And so I'm like, "Okay, but listen,
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.360]   "you can't take it straight to the curb."
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.100]   And he's like, "Okay, I won't, Daddy, I won't."
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.120]   I give it back to him.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.320]   He hammers the gas, boom, straight into the curb,
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.440]   cars in pieces again.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.680]   I go, I put the car back together, I'm driving it.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.760]   He's just, "Let me drive, let me drive,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.600]   "let me drive, let me drive."
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.120]   We do this about four or five times
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.960]   until it's broken, like, to the point
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.640]   that it can't be repaired by me anyways.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.840]   I've gotta take it back to the hobby shop
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.320]   and say, "Hey, can you guys fix this?"
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.960]   No, he's a three-year-old, I know.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   And so what's funny about that
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.980]   is, like, he never came to the conclusion, like,
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.020]   "I'm not good at this."
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.620]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.640]   Like, even though he was really bad at it,
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.780]   he was like, "Let me drive, let me drive,
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.900]   "let me drive, let me drive."
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.900]   That's your flesh.
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.380]   Your flesh doesn't care if it's running into walls
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.620]   at 30 miles an hour.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.640]   It just wants the steering wheel.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.700]   It doesn't care if your life's a train wreck.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.300]   It doesn't care if you're sad, if you're desperate,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.860]   if you're despairing, if you're depressed.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.060]   It doesn't care if you're drunk or hungover.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.260]   It doesn't care how you feel.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.140]   It just wants the steering wheel.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.380]   And it continues to do the same thing
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.840]   over and over and over.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.380]   And so you're like, "Maybe this time we will get married."
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.540]   No, you probably won't.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.580]   It's probably gonna end in flames
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.100]   'cause you're not letting the Spirit drive.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.020]   "This time I won't feel so bad."
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.620]   Yes, you will.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.140]   Because you have the Holy Spirit
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.200]   and you grieve the Spirit when you sin.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.220]   I've heard it said, "When you become a Christian,
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.220]   "you're not sinless, you just sin less and you feel worse."
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.140]   When you become a Christian, you're not sinless,
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.940]   you just sin less and you feel worse.
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.060]   So Paul writes, verse nine, "You, however, you,"
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.060]   there's this like new category, like, okay,
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.980]   there's the one who lives by the flesh
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.260]   and runs cars into walls at 30 miles an hour
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.660]   and their life's in flames, but you're different.
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.720]   You're different.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.940]   You're not in the realm of the flesh,
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.140]   but you're in the realm of the Spirit, the Spirit of God.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.780]   You live for eternal things.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.980]   You don't live for the merely stupid,
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.020]   temporary, natural things,
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.340]   the things of this world that won't be here.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.620]   You live in the realm of the Spirit,
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.780]   if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.860]   And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.740]   then they don't belong to Christ.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.300]   But if Christ is in you,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.360]   then even though your body is subject to death
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.860]   because of sin, the Spirit gives life
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.140]   because of righteousness.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.980]   Whose righteousness?
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.220]   Your righteousness?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.020]   Now, this is the gospel right here.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.120]   This is what we just celebrated at Easter,
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.820]   that he gets the death that you deserve
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.300]   and you get the life that he deserves.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.600]   His righteousness is imputed to you,
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.380]   accredited to your account,
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.980]   that God sees you as righteous
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.480]   because his Son died in your place.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.140]   And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.240]   is living in you,
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.420]   he who raised Christ from the dead,
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.100]   okay, I'm just reading this,
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.140]   but just in case, like you tuned out,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.460]   tuned out, like lean in.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.700]   He who raised Christ from the dead
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.140]   will also give life to your mortal bodies
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.460]   because of his Spirit who lives in you.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.260]   Grasp now with me this profound reality
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.220]   that the same Spirit who brought Christ,
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.700]   who was dead, bloody, okay,
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.700]   puncture wound in his side,
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.520]   he bled out, he's been whipped to death,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.600]   he hung crucified on a cross,
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.960]   he's now wrapped in all these burial clothes
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.020]   and put in a cave with a big stone in front of it.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.000]   And then all of a sudden,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.260]   this Spirit that's so powerful
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.860]   that it's like, (whooshing)
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:07.700]   and he's back.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.060]   That Spirit lives in you.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.320]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.160]   Just me?
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160]   I'm like, serious?
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.560]   That Spirit lives in you.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.740]   See, when the non-believer sins,
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.600]   that's just their job description.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.920]   That's what verse nine and 10 are saying.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.640]   They're just doing what they're supposed to do.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.780]   But when a believer lives in sin,
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.660]   that's confusing because the Spirit of God
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.220]   does not live in sin.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.080]   So my second point this evening is
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.500]   your driver determines your destination.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.960]   Whosoever at the steering wheel,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.280]   that determines where you go.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.220]   You don't have to go the way of death.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.540]   See, if you're a Christian,
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.380]   you have a ready, willing, and able driver in Christ.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.220]   Jesus Christ, his Spirit lives with you.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.120]   But if you have no desire to do the things of God,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.400]   if you have no desire to go where God is leading,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.920]   then you are most likely not a Christian.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.540]   Like, if there's no desire in you to satisfy God,
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.120]   to go his way, to go where he's leading,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.760]   to let him drive, then you are most likely
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   do not have the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.640]   You are not a Christian.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   But if when you sin, you're grieved, you're saddened,
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.040]   you want to jump back on the path of righteousness,
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.080]   you want to pursue God, you've believed upon the gospel,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.340]   that's a different story.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.820]   Your driver determines your destination.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.080]   A part of being gone these five weeks,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.480]   Monica and I had the incredible opportunity to go to Israel.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.680]   And so we did this tour in Israel,
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   which was, I mean, just amazing, trip of a lifetime, truly.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.300]   And we had this incredible driver,
[00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.960]   we're on this tour bus, you know, with friends,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.000]   and the first thing that he would do
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.600]   when we'd get on the bus is he would punch
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.040]   in the destination in the GPS.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.340]   That's what a good driver does.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.440]   The driver starts with the destination in mind.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.940]   He's like, okay, where do you guys want to go?
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.420]   Let me make sure that I take you there.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.580]   Even if he knows the destination, he's putting it in,
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.580]   saying, hey, what are the right traffic routes to take?
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.980]   What are the rights to, how do I make sure
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.340]   that I get there in the right amount of time?
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.700]   You begin to punch in that destination.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.780]   Well, the mind kind of works this way,
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.220]   kind of like a GPS system, right?
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.020]   When you've continued to go to the bars of Uptown,
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.780]   the bars of Sunday Square, the bars in Houston,
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.860]   wherever you're at, if you're listening somewhere else,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.260]   when you continue to live the lifestyle of the world,
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.240]   the lifestyle that cannot please God, right,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.640]   you're punching in those addresses,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.200]   and what does a GPS system do?
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.560]   It begins to auto-populate.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.920]   It's like, oh, you want me to go there?
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.040]   Oh, I know that place, like, let's go.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.760]   Like, you put in the first two numbers of the address,
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.640]   it's like, oh, you want to go home?
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.840]   I know home.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.680]   First two numbers of the address, it's like,
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.600]   oh, you want to go to work?
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.560]   I know work, I know that way.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.740]   I'm ready to take you there.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.760]   Put in the first two numbers of the strip club,
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.120]   like, oh, yeah, we've been there, let's go.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.500]   Bar, let's go.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.380]   Party, let's go, right?
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.660]   But what happens when you stop going to those places?
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.220]   It forgets those addresses.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.820]   The spiritual life, you begin to put in new addresses.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.380]   Elena said, I changed my Playmates in my playground,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.300]   even where I live, she said.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.500]   I begin to punch in new addresses,
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.260]   and the old addresses fell out,
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.380]   and the new addresses begin to populate the GPS,
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.360]   and that's where I wanted to go.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.220]   Oh, you want to go to church?
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.460]   I know church, let's go to church.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.660]   You want a fellowship with those friends?
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.340]   Okay, I know those friends, let's go with those friends.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.180]   You want community?
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.080]   Let's go, let's go, let's go, I'm ready.
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.900]   And all of a sudden, you have a new life.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.960]   Why, because you changed drivers.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.100]   Now the Spirit's driving,
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.360]   it's taking you to different places, different destinations.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:04.400]   The flesh desires to kill you.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.460]   That's a weird statement, like, how is the flesh,
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.140]   I just keep saying, if you pursue the flesh,
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.700]   if you let the flesh drive, you're going to die.
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.540]   Why is this?
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.020]   Because everything the flesh wants
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.580]   hurts your relationship with God, which gives life.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:25.080]   And so what is this death that comes from feeding the flesh?
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.840]   It's anxiety, it's exhaustion, anybody tired,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.580]   it's hangovers, it's pregnancy scares, it's heartbreak.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.040]   Oh, I can't go on, I feel like I can't go on.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.160]   Like my whole life was wrapped up in Him,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.760]   I just feel like I can't move on.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:48.120]   It's guilt, it's shame, I feel bad,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.440]   it's depression, it's despair.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.480]   And maybe worse than all of those things is apathy.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.020]   It's a life without meaning.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.160]   You know what, I haven't done anything with my life
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.120]   that has eternal implications.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.020]   No, I mean, I'm the king of the city.
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.900]   But in eternity, my life won't matter
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.000]   because I've lived my life for me.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.740]   And I'm kind of like those dysfunctional people
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.780]   that he talked about.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.180]   That's some of us, not all of us, but that's some of us.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.620]   Some of us need to hear that.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:29.420]   But we have a God, you have a driver that you can trust
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.140]   who's leading you to life.
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.820]   This is the good news, right?
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.700]   You have a driver that is ready, willing, and able in Christ
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.300]   and he's leading you to life.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.140]   Some of you, if we've hung out together for a while,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.620]   you know that I had a terrifying fear of flying,
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.300]   like a debilitating fear of flying.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.540]   And that was really unfortunate
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.740]   because I had a job that required me to fly.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.580]   And every time I'd get on that plane,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.860]   you know, it was like my palms were sweaty, knees weak,
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.580]   arms were heavy, vomit on my sweater.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.140]   No, and so every time I'd get on that plane,
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.980]   it was just like anxiety overwhelmed me, you know,
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.180]   and I'm sitting there.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.140]   And until the moment, there was this really defining moment
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.660]   that changed everything.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:13.660]   And it was a conversation with a pilot.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.980]   And I was just like, man, when we hit turbulence,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.460]   it feels like the wings are gonna fall off.
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.740]   He's like, the wings are gonna fall.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.100]   I'm like, are you guys scared?
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.340]   He's like, turbulence?
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.940]   He's like, man, we're having fun.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.860]   You know, most of us, like the airlines,
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.300]   they hire like ex-fighter pilots.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.560]   Like, have you noticed the guys?
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.580]   Like, they're old guys.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.780]   They're coming out of the army.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.220]   They've been dog fighting and flying planes at like,
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.320]   who knows how faster than the, you know, sound barrier
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.060]   and breaking the sound barrier and all this.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.000]   And he's like telling me this.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.420]   He's like, when we hit turbulence,
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.660]   like that's the only part that we actually enjoy
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.380]   because like, we're like sleeping at the wheel.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.620]   I'm like, well, that doesn't make me feel better.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.300]   But he's like, man, we're up there like flying,
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.620]   you know, from this town, this city to this city.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.460]   Like, that's boring.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.460]   Like the turbulence, that's kind of fun.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.420]   You know, I'm like, you're having fun.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.380]   He's like, we're having fun.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.660]   He's like, you think that plane's gonna fall out of the sky
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.020]   'cause of some bumps?
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.900]   And I was like, no, I wouldn't think that, you know.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.820]   And it was just like that conversation.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.780]   And so what happened is I began to look at the pilots.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.360]   And I'm like, man, they had some gray hair.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.240]   They had these like official shirts
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.160]   with these stripes on their sleeves.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.020]   And I'm like, dude, these guys are pros.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.940]   Like, they're really experienced.
[00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.100]   The God that you can trust is experienced.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.500]   Like, you think that you're gonna bump up
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.980]   against something that he hasn't dealt with
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.260]   countless number of times?
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.780]   Like he's thrown for a loop?
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.300]   Like, you're like, God, I don't know what,
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.140]   I just got laid off and I know you don't know what to do.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.500]   He's like, dude, you know how many people
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.720]   got laid off today and I'm taking care of them?
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.180]   Look at the birds of the air.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.220]   It's like, God, he broke my heart.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.840]   I know this has really thrown you for a loop.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.540]   He's like, come on, man, I got you.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.260]   I love you, I got a plan for you.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.260]   You think I haven't been here a billion times?
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.900]   Do you trust me?
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.360]   Hand me the keys.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.260]   Hand me the keys, let me drive, stop driving.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:18.060]   God's spirit has a perfect track record, right?
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.100]   He can bring the dead, what's the worst
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.920]   that can happen to me?
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.760]   I can die?
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.460]   He's like, dude, I got that, I've been there.
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.400]   You know, see, also Easter, right?
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.920]   A life of trusting God's spirit,
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.980]   this comes straight from Galatians 5, 22 through 23,
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.100]   if you wanna write that down.
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.460]   A life of trusting God's spirit is a life
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.300]   full of love, joy, peace, patience,
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.140]   kindness, goodness, gentleness,
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.660]   faithfulness, and self-control.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.080]   That's what God's spirit gives.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.060]   That's where he leads.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.100]   That's where he's driving you to.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.660]   That's the one that you can trust.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.620]   And so Paul is teaching us this incredibly valuable lesson
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:03.420]   that is simply this, your thoughts take you places.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.340]   What you think about is taking you somewhere.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.140]   And it's different destinations.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.080]   Destinations in this world, right?
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.660]   You have never, ever found yourself in sin
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.500]   without first thinking about it.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.020]   No one in the history of existence has sinned, right,
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.240]   without thinking about it,
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.820]   have some thought start in their mind
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.940]   and it carries them there.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.860]   James says this in chapter one, verse 14,
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.460]   that it begins, every sin begins with our own desire,
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.340]   a desire within us that takes us there.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.760]   And so different destinations in this world,
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.020]   but also different destinations in the afterlife.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.700]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.060]   Your thoughts point to ultimately who you've trusted in,
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.420]   whether that's yourself or Christ,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.700]   his death and resurrection for the forgiveness of your sins.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.480]   And so you might say, well, I can't control my thoughts, JP.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.040]   I can't stop sinning.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:10.200]   I'm a Christian and I can't stop committing the same sin.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.720]   And I'm just like, what?
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   You're telling me that the spirit who gave life to Christ,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:24.080]   the one who busted open the tomb, who defeated death,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.320]   that same spirit can't help you stop looking at porn?
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.700]   What is he broken?
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.160]   He's not working for you?
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.380]   That same spirit can't help you stop obsessing
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.820]   about a relationship?
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.860]   Like he can bring Jesus back to life,
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:45.460]   but he's just stumped at the fact
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.260]   that you're obsessed with your body.
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.900]   Oh man, it's the spirit who brought Christ to life
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.900]   that lives with you.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.780]   Have you tried surrendering to him?
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.180]   God, I can't, but you can.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.720]   God, I've tried everything.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:09.160]   Covenant Eyes, XXX Church, accountability, community.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.680]   I've tried community membership.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.640]   I've tried membership.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.500]   I've tried everything.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.540]   Cool, have you tried trusting me?
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.020]   Have you tried surrendering?
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:28.380]   Sometimes, just to say this,
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.260]   kind of doesn't even address here,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.740]   but I met with some of you recently
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.180]   who are like obsessed with conjuring up the spirit of God
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.020]   for the gifts of the spirit.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.420]   You know, I'm speaking tongues.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.940]   I'm like, cool, but man, you know that,
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.300]   like you're stuck in pornography,
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.420]   and that doesn't honor God.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.900]   And so, man, maybe you could switch out tongues
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.940]   for putting to death the deeds of the flesh.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.500]   Like we get so excited about conjuring up
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.700]   the gifts of the spirit.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.580]   He's like, hey man, how about long obedience
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.720]   in the same direction?
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.260]   How about trusting me for a change?
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.380]   How about handing me the keys to your life
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.580]   and letting me drive?
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:13.180]   How about submitting to authority?
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.500]   How about coming into a church and belonging
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.920]   like I clearly asked you to in my word?
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.020]   How about trusting my spirit in that way
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.520]   and stop treating me like a genie or a party trick?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.140]   Verse 12.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:37.320]   Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.780]   We have an obligation, but this obligation,
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.860]   it's not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.460]   That's not what we're obligated to do.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.340]   For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:53.380]   But if by the spirit you put to death
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:58.380]   the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.780]   Jesus says you will have life and have it to the foolish.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.660]   You will have life and have it abundantly.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.620]   Following God is not a cop-out.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.780]   It's where the real party is.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.620]   And I'm not naive.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.860]   Like just in case we don't know each other,
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.340]   like I partied.
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.660]   Like I probably partied as hard as any one of you
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.340]   in this room right now, okay?
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.800]   And so I'm not crazy.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.160]   I'm not brainwashed by the church.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.880]   I'm telling you life is found in Jesus
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.540]   and Jesus alone, nowhere else.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.700]   That's what Elena told you too.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.540]   Like she's not up here.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.360]   We didn't brainwash her.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.140]   We didn't have her drink some Kool-Aid or something.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.940]   Like she's just like, hey, I found something good.
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:35.500]   I wanna tell you guys about it.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:40.740]   And so my third and final point is designate a driver.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.180]   Designate a driver, your flesh or God's spirit.
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.860]   You choose.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.300]   Tonight, you get to say, hey, who's gonna drive
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.260]   the rest of my life?
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.380]   Designate a driver because you are obligated to your driver.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.300]   And if you're choosing the spirit,
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.660]   you're obligated then to put to death
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.800]   the deeds of the flesh.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.740]   So you have the help of the same spirit
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.700]   who raised Christ from the dead.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.420]   Now listen, your flesh is gonna wanna continue to drive.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:16.260]   It's just like Weston, crazy in a good way.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.380]   No, but the flesh isn't.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.360]   I was just saying my son, I felt bad for calling him crazy.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.980]   So my son's not crazy.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.060]   Your flesh is crazy.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.020]   Now we're clear.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.100]   Your flesh wants to kill you.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.700]   It wants the steering wheel,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.820]   but it wants to drive you off a cliff
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.740]   if that has not been crystal clear.
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.100]   I hope that you leave with that.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.900]   And so you must make it a practice
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.060]   to surrender your thoughts to the spirit,
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:41.560]   not to dwell on what the flesh desires,
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.780]   not to watch movies that feed your flesh,
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.360]   not to watch shows that feed your flesh,
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.220]   not to listen to music that feeds your flesh.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.940]   I know that sounds legalistic and kind of,
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.900]   man, you just kind of went where the church I grew up in.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.260]   I'm not trying to, I'm just telling you,
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.820]   there is some truth to that.
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.140]   You are feeding your mind and it's feeding your desires.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.900]   And you listen to a song and it's all of a sudden,
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.820]   it's like, man, I want everything that song said.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.660]   You watch a show and it's like,
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.880]   man, I want everything that show just showed.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.540]   I want 24 guys chasing me, right?
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:10.500]   It's like, what?
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.540]   It's crazy.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.860]   But as you walk by the spirit,
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.860]   as you walk by the spirit,
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.960]   you're closer to heaven with every step.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.280]   That's a beautiful reality.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:28.020]   As you walk by the spirit,
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.340]   he is leading you to a destination,
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:31.500]   which is eternity with God,
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.240]   and you're closer to it with every step.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.900]   The other day, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.860]   we went to Six Flags, took the kids to Six Flags.
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.700]   They had never been and it's a big deal.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.540]   They're excited.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.420]   And as we got close to Six Flags,
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.380]   if you've been there, you know, like from far off,
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.580]   you can see the tops of the roller coaster.
[00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.860]   And it's so interesting.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.940]   The second they saw the tops of the roller coaster,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.660]   all of the joy and all of the excitement
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.860]   of being in the amusement park was now in the car.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.460]   It's like, we see it.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.780]   We're gonna get to ride that.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.620]   We're going.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.440]   And with every turn,
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.180]   we were closer to those roller coasters.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:11.420]   They became bigger and more real and closer to us.
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.300]   With every rotation of the tire,
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.700]   we were closer to our destination.
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.700]   And the excitement of the destination filled the car
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.460]   until like one moment,
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.100]   we're at the kind of toll booth where you pay to park.
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.540]   And the next moment we're in the park.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.220]   It was just a natural progression.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.220]   When you walk the spiritual life by the spirit,
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.260]   when you die and you pass from this world to eternity
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.540]   in the presence of God, also known as heaven,
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.420]   it's just the next natural progression.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.460]   You've been looking at it with every step
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.980]   and the excitement and anticipation of eternity with God
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.640]   at glorification is filling your life.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.620]   And the joy that comes from that is now in your world.
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.420]   And every step you take with the spirit
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.420]   in the driver's seat is taking you there.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.940]   And the excitement builds as you move closer
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.340]   to eternity with God.
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.480]   So much so that when your heart stops beating,
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.340]   it's just the next natural step to eternity life with God,
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.060]   to eternity with God, to eternal life with God.
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.380]   It's just the next thing.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.820]   It's just where the spirit has been taking you
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.860]   since you were 21, since you were 32,
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   since you were 40, 56, 77, 83,
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.460]   hello Jesus.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.780]   It's just where you are.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.040]   That's allowing the spirit to drive.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.740]   And so we're experiencing more and more of him
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.020]   where real life is found.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.860]   And the flesh simply desires to take you off course.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   And so what's the application, real quick?
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.020]   The application is simply letting the spirit drive.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.380]   And you say, well, how do I do that?
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.520]   It's verse five, live in accordance with the spirit.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.140]   It's filling your mind with God's instruction.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.540]   Here's a thing, it's meditation.
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.100]   And you say, well, meditation, really?
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.420]   See, I think we've been confused on what meditation is.
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.980]   Eastern meditation is emptying your mind.
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.700]   It's not thinking about anything.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.620]   Biblical meditation is filling your mind
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.580]   with the things of God, the truths of God,
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.280]   learning the scriptures of God,
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.100]   yielding to the spirit of God.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.140]   Biblical meditation is not at all emptying your mind
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.480]   but filling it so that when you fill your mind
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.440]   with the things of God,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.700]   you filled your life with the things of God.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.820]   You are the things of God.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.880]   And it begins with you filling your mind
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.000]   with the things of God.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.320]   This is what it looks like to let the spirit drive.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.680]   And so in summary, there's a fight
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.380]   for the driver's seat of your mind
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.920]   between the flesh and the spirit.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.800]   And your driver determines your destination
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   both in this world and the world to come.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.080]   And so tonight, I'm admonishing you,
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:10.340]   I'm exhorting you to designate a driver,
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.360]   your flesh or God's spirit.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:18.800]   I wanna end in a way that it's really
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.160]   how I wanted to start.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.560]   I didn't wanna distract you.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:26.480]   But the other day I was on Twitter
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.820]   and a friend of mine had,
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.680]   I was reading a tweet from a friend
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.840]   and it had a hashtag and it was a curious hashtag.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.880]   It wasn't an immoral hashtag in any way.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.000]   It was just a curious hashtag
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.840]   and my flesh began to wonder
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.440]   what's on the other side of that hashtag
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.600]   and so I clicked on it.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.560]   I scrolled with my, on my phone,
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.560]   my iPhone, I scrolled down
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.160]   and I felt that kind of excitement
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.400]   wondering if I was gonna see something,
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.080]   maybe a girl in a bathing suit,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.640]   something like that and I didn't.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.200]   But I saw another hashtag
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.280]   and my flesh wondered what's behind this hashtag,
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.600]   maybe something more promising
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.800]   and so I clicked on it and I scrolled
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.720]   and I saw nudity.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.440]   I saw a topless woman
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.000]   and I kind of woke up, if you will,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.280]   I kind of came to, I was like startled
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.240]   and I knew it wasn't like I had done that accidentally.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.960]   I knew that there was a huge part of me
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.280]   that was seeking that out and I was so grieved
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.600]   because it's been years since I had pursued pornography
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.920]   and there I was in that moment,
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.200]   I found myself back in that place.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.640]   How did I get here?
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.000]   And the shame and the guilt
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   and everything came back in that moment.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.880]   And by the grace of God, I put my phone down,
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.080]   I go to my computer, I didn't act out on it
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.480]   any further than that but I go and I email my guys
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.040]   and I say, hey, I want you to know what I just did.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.880]   I sought this out
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.720]   and I walked them through the same process
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.760]   that I just walked you through.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.120]   I clicked here, I didn't see something,
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.380]   I went further in and I found something.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.680]   I said, will you pray for me
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.320]   that I would forget it, that I'd be free?
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.120]   Monica got home, my wife got home
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.760]   and said, baby, sit down, I need to talk to you.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.600]   She said, what's wrong?
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.320]   I said, I want you to know what I just did.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.800]   I told her.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.840]   All the while, my flesh is like, you can't tell her.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.640]   Like, she's gonna, you can't do that.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.120]   I put to death the teeth of the flesh.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.640]   Monica, this is what I did, will you please forgive me?
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.200]   And then shortly thereafter, I was with a group of pastors.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:41.320]   We were meeting to pray and to dream about the church.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.480]   I said, guys, before we go further, we were at a meal.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.560]   I said, I want you to know what I've done.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.720]   I told them.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.660]   I want to tell you.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.000]   I don't want to be a hypocrite over here,
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.400]   like, hey, don't give in to the ways of the flesh.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.600]   I gave in to the ways of the flesh.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.640]   Would you guys please forgive me?
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.080]   As your pastor, I don't want to be a fraud.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.740]   I don't want to preach one thing and do another.
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.140]   Would you please forgive me?
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.000]   Would you please forgive me?
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:13.840]   I'm asking.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.120]   Thank you.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.200]   Thank you.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.760]   I want you to know how I got there.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.620]   It wasn't a long strategic plan.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:31.840]   It wasn't something premeditated the day before.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.100]   It was in a moment my flesh opened the driver's side door
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.500]   and said, hey, scoot over.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.940]   Let me drive for a few minutes, a few seconds.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.020]   Let me drive.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.720]   I found myself off a cliff.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.840]   Not trying to avoid being culpable, it was me.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   It was the part of me that loves to sin.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.340]   It was the part of me that grieved the Spirit.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.700]   It was this part of me that wanted the steering wheel.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.660]   It was the part of me that can't honor God.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.820]   It was the part of me that Christ died for.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.500]   It was the part of me that has found freedom in Him.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.180]   And so,
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:17.220]   tonight, with you, I designate the Holy Spirit
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.560]   as driver of my life.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.200]   And I want you to do the same.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.480]   And I want you to meet a friend of mine
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.700]   who also has done that.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:36.520]   - My name's Phillip Ward,
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:40.600]   and my life before Christ was a lie.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.440]   I grew up in a Christian home, went to church on Sundays,
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.960]   but I thought Jesus was just a complete fairy tale.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:53.160]   And so, because I thought Jesus was a fairy tale,
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:56.480]   I lived my life like there were no consequences.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.280]   I started DJing when I was in eighth grade,
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.760]   and I had dreams of just becoming the next big music mogul.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.880]   I wanted to be just like Diddy.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.200]   That was my goal.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.880]   And so, I was introduced into the music industry
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.200]   after college.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.880]   A friend that I was managing, an artist,
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.240]   signed a record deal,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   and the song went big on the Billboard charts.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.720]   And so, we were everywhere.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.960]   We were touring across the country.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.800]   So, sex, alcohol, and drugs,
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.480]   they were all readily available at my fingertips
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.240]   whenever I wanted.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   And I did not deny myself.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.800]   I lived it, and I was there.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.380]   The clubs, the lights, the fast money,
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:41.860]   the fame, the vainglory,
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:44.300]   I drank from that cup deeply,
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.320]   but still I thirsted for more.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.840]   For years, I chased for more.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.440]   Why?
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.320]   Because I knew.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.200]   I knew it deep down, it would never be enough.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.680]   Never enough money, never enough fame,
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.880]   never enough sex, never enough drugs.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.560]   It's never enough.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:10.560]   And in 2013, I got brought to this place, to the porch.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:13.080]   And I was the guy who would come to church
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.400]   just to take a picture for social media,
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.680]   to share so people would think that I was a good guy.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.400]   And so, I wasn't.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.440]   But I kept coming back because never in my life
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.000]   had I heard someone passionately speak
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.440]   about how broken they were before Christ
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:31.560]   and drive home the point
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.120]   that there was no life outside of Christ.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.940]   I thought, this guy, JP, he's been where I've been.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.760]   He really believes this.
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.000]   He really believes this Jesus thing.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.120]   And so, one Tuesday night broke me.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.880]   I was sitting about right there.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.080]   And JP from the stage, he screamed out,
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:54.400]   "You're not a Christian, you're not a Christian,
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.840]   "you're not a Christian."
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.760]   And I sank into my seat.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.040]   And that was the first time I realized I'm not a Christian.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.520]   And so, I began a mission to get to the truth.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.520]   Did Jesus really die for my sins?
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:09.360]   Did he even exist?
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.900]   And did he rise?
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.520]   And what I found, yes, he did.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.160]   And I gave up everything.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.480]   I completely left the world I was living in
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.520]   because what else can you do
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.000]   when you meet a guy who can defeat death but follow him?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.160]   And so, now, my life with Christ
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.680]   has been a radical transformation.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.020]   Saturday actually marked two years
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.160]   since I've trusted in Christ.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.820]   And I finally found the one thing that is enough, Jesus.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:41.240]   Because of the cross, I've been set free
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   from chasing after sex, alcohol, drugs, fame.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.980]   My mission now is to make him famous for who he is
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.880]   and what he's done.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:52.700]   Let's pray.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:51:02.920]   God, thank you for being the good driver in our lives.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:09.000]   Lord, I pray for the souls in here who don't know who he is.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.280]   I pray that tonight someone will realize
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.080]   that they are not a Christian and they will come forward
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:19.880]   and trust in the one and only hope that we have, Jesus.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.160]   Lord, I pray for all my friends
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.260]   who have the spirit and joy in them,
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.240]   that they would run after you.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.960]   That we would put to death the deeds of the flesh,
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.600]   that we would trust in you more.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.720]   Lord, I pray that you would continue to work in hearts
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.560]   and broken men and women to change lives
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.800]   and to tell stories of grace.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   Would you continue to work through us?
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.320]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.520]   The Holy Spirit, I don't wanna belittle
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.620]   the Holy Spirit at all with this metaphor,
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.040]   but I was thinking about it as we were singing.
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.800]   And he's like a driver.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.240]   I mean, that's been the metaphor throughout this evening.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.720]   And when I was thinking about drivers,
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:03.120]   like professional drivers,
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.880]   they love people who can't drive.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.520]   Like their whole job security depends on it, right?
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.560]   And so if you're here and you look at your life
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:13.320]   and you're like, man, you don't understand.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.840]   Like I'm a terrible driver.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.240]   I mean, I've done things
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.960]   that I can't even get out of my mouth.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.560]   I can't even say the words.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.320]   Like God delights in forgiving you.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:34.120]   Like it brings him great joy to restore you,
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.240]   to take an incredible sinner
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.520]   and make him or her an amazing saint for eternity.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.800]   And it's his work, not yours.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.120]   You don't need to leave here with any guilt,
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.440]   with any shame.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.840]   In a moment, all your sins can be forgiven.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.760]   Forgiven by trusting in what Christ has done on the cross,
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.660]   his finished work.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.520]   Like my friend said so eloquently tonight,
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   it is finished, paid for, done.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:09.600]   That's what we just celebrated.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.040]   And so I would clap if I were you.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.540]   (congregation applauding)
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:19.920]   Philip said a lot of JP.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.920]   JP's a fool.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.040]   JP will chase some hashtags, man.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:27.720]   I just know a great God.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:30.080]   And I want you to know a great God
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.200]   who will set you free,
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   who will course correct your life in a moment.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.080]   Talked a lot about the Holy Spirit tonight.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.420]   The Holy Spirit speaks to you in three ways.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:45.920]   The most sure, most confident way, his word.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.280]   The written word of God.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.560]   His people in prayer.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.980]   That quiet voice within you.
[00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.800]   But all three of those ways he speaks to us,
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.120]   the word says.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.040]   And so if you're not surrounded by his people,
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.800]   you have hushed the Holy Spirit.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.280]   You have quieted God in your life.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.520]   You've asked him to be silent in this avenue.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:12.760]   And so every Tuesday we give you a way to do that
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:14.280]   in open community groups.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.680]   And so if you wanna hear more about what it looks like
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.000]   to belong to a community group,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.840]   guys, you can walk down this hallway
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.480]   and there's a room full of men
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.240]   who would love to talk with you about that.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.960]   Ladies, you walk down this hallway
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.840]   and there's a room out there full of women
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.560]   who would love to talk with you about that.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.480]   It's a joy to travel with you through Romans 8.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.440]   Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
