1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,740
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,980
 - All right, well, hey, welcome everybody in the room.

5
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,960
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
 Everybody tuning in online at Porch Live locations,

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,840
 and especially Porch North Houston,

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,800
 Porch Midland, Porch Boise, Porch Des Moines,

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,200
 Porch Scottsdale, all the different live locations.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,180
 Everybody joining us, we're continuing the series POV,

11
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,720
 looking at interactions that particular men and women had

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,840
 with the Son of God when He was on the planet.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
 Let me start with a story, an illustration

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,280
 that'll kind of set up where we're gonna go.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,280
 In the spring of 2012, I made the decision

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
 that I wanted to ask the girl I was dating to marry me.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
 Yeah, thank you very much.

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,800
 Yeah, thanks guys.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,960
 And I came up with a plan, I had it all thought through.

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,080
 I was going to ask her,

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,480
 and I planned to ask her on her birthday.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
 Why?

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
 Because I assume that she knew that asking on her birthday

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,760
 is one of those almost goes without saying cliche.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,000
 Everyone would think to do that,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
 so I'm gonna reverse psychology this and do it then.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,480
 And I came up with a plan.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,560
 It also allowed me to fly under the radar

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,300
 of putting a birthday celebration together,

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,320
 because that's just what you do,

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,480
 you're doing a birthday thing.

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,100
 And then at the end of that celebration,

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,540
 I'd be able to pop the question.

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,320
 So the plan was to pick her up in the morning,

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,360
 we were gonna go out to the lake and kayak

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
 at White Rock here in Dallas.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
 We were then gonna go, and I set up like a spa day,

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,720
 this is your birthday gift, go to the spa,

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,360
 I'll pick you up at four o'clock,

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,240
 we're gonna go to the Arboretum,

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,400
 and then we'll go to dinner.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,920
 Now, I called the Arboretum that day

43
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,880
 to make sure, like this is how thought through it was,

44
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,600
 or Inception-esque it was,

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,040
 I wanted to make sure that at any point

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,680
 if she was on the trail, I was gonna throw her off the trail,

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,600
 and so I called the Arboretum to confirm

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,320
 it was closed that day.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,120
 I wanted to make sure that in case she suspected anything,

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,760
 like man, this seems like a lot of things,

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,720
 I would put in little breadcrumb trails, so to speak,

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
 to throw her off, and so we'd show up at the Arboretum,

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
 and it'd be like, oh, this is closed,

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
 and so she'd be like, oh, he would've for sure

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,280
 thought through this if he was gonna ask me to marry me.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,840
 So we go to the lake, we kayak, she goes to the spa,

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,200
 pick her up, take her to the Arboretum.

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,520
 Little did I know that while I'm thinking,

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,660
 we're gonna show up at the Arboretum,

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,120
 and I called multiple times, like hey,

61
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
 I need to make sure for sure it is closed.

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
 I need to show up, you're gonna tell us it's closed, sir.

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,840
 Yes, sir, we're gonna be closed.

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,040
 'Cause I had planned that I'd be like,

65
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
 oh, well, we got still time before dinner,

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,040
 so let's go to this park down the road,

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,640
 and we'll just kinda hang out,

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,120
 where I had two of my boys hiding in the bushes

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,160
 to take pictures.

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,460
 So the day comes, we go kayaking, it's great,

71
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,380
 she goes, does the spa thing, I pick her up,

72
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,280
 we go to the Arboretum, we show up,

73
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
 and I pull up to the gate, and it's closed.

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
 And I'm going, man, this is going right according to plan.

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
 She's thinking, we're getting engaged,

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,420
 and he did not even think to call ahead

77
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,000
 to see if this place was open.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
 She, for whatever reason, had still been on the trail,

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,520
 and I'm like, oh, man, well, it's closed, oh, no.

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
 And I can visibly tell,

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,920
 she is, there's a change in what's going on.

82
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,480
 Her expectations, I'm going, oh, no, she, oh, no.

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
 So I'm like, oh, no, this will be great,

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
 we're gonna go to dinner,

85
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,280
 and let's go to this park over here,

86
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,520
 and, you know, I just happen to have some bread,

87
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
 we'll feed the ducks.

88
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,600
 And I pull out the bread, we go to feed the ducks.

89
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,120
 And then Mother Nature strikes, and it starts raining.

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,720
 And I'm like, oh, man, this is not going according to plan,

91
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,480
 but I brought an umbrella.

92
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,320
 And so I pull out the umbrella,

93
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 but there's no, thank you very much, thank you.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,120
 There's no casual way to show,

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,760
 without throwing off, like, this is just bizarre,

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,880
 to go out with an umbrella, and it's raining,

97
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,320
 and she's like, no, we're not gonna feed the ducks.

98
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,260
 No, I got an umbrella, where it doesn't look weird,

99
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,640
 like, no, no, these ducks, they're very hungry.

100
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,920
 We need to go feed them.

101
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,560
 And she's like, okay, and so I'm like over there

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,280
 with the umbrella, and I'm like walking.

103
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,360
 It was so muddy that I had to pick her up.

104
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,240
 She had a piggyback ride over to the lake by the umbrella.

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
 I get over there, and I'm just trying to play it cool,

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,240
 and of course, I'm on the inside, just freaking out.

107
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,880
 And I start to rip the bread apart,

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
 and I'm throwing it to these ducks.

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
 It's over here in Highland Park.

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,700
 Throwing the bread in the water,

111
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,360
 and the ducks come up to it, and then just swim right off.

112
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
 Like, even the ducks in Highland Park are stuck up.

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
 What is this, birds?

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,240
 And I'm kidding, don't email me, it's a joke, people.

115
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,280
 Okay, anyway, so we're doing the bread thing.

116
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,040
 Eventually, I say, you know what, we're just done with this,

117
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,320
 and I get to the place after reading some things

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,480
 and telling her some things, and I hit one knee

119
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,520
 and ask her the most important question

120
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,520
 I'll ever ask another person, and she says, yes.

121
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,760
 Yeah, thank you.

122
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,040
 Now, what does that have to do with tonight?

123
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 Well, in that scenario, it was asking

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,520
 the most important earthly question, if you will,

125
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,280
 that I'll probably ever ask.

126
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,280
 And her answer to that question would dramatically shape

127
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,840
 the future she would have and the future I would have.

128
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,920
 And tonight, we're gonna look at a conversation

129
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,160
 that involves a man coming to Jesus with specific questions,

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,080
 and Jesus' answers to those questions

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 are going to dramatically shape the future

132
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,440
 this man will have and the eternal life this man will have,

133
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 and they are the same answers to the same question

134
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,560
 that if you don't get right,

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,040
 or depending on how you answer them,

136
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,000
 is going to dramatically shape the future

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,100
 you're gonna have for now and for all of eternity.

138
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,840
 And I think there are some people in the room

139
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,880
 who have been asking and wondering this question

140
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,760
 and the questions that Jesus is going to answer

141
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,040
 as it relates to who will spend eternity with God,

142
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,440
 how you can have a relationship with God,

143
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,600
 and what the heart of God is really like.

144
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,700
 And I think God has you here tonight

145
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,600
 so that for the rest of the rest

146
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
 of however many days ahead God has for you,

147
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,720
 you can have certainty that you have the answers

148
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,640
 to the most important questions,

149
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,040
 not you're gonna ask to another person,

150
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,120
 but you'll ever ask, period,

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,400
 and that God has given you the correct answers.

152
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,000
 So we're gonna be in John chapter three.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,440
 John chapter three is an exchange between a teacher

154
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,860
 and a famous teacher at the time and Jesus.

155
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,720
 And it's a man who had questions about who this new rabbi,

156
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
 I mean, this is super early in Jesus' ministry.

157
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
 He just started, basically just appeared on the scene.

158
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,600
 Chapter two, he does his first miracle,

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,240
 changes water into wine, word's starting to spread,

160
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,800
 and this well-known religious leader shows up

161
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
 and he says, man, I've just got some questions.

162
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
 And Jesus walks through and gives us really two things

163
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,740
 that I wanna highlight.

164
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,800
 There's a lot we could unpack,

165
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,600
 but I just wanna quickly unpack two things

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,560
 that give us the answers

167
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,680
 to some of the most important questions

168
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,240
 you're ever gonna ask,

169
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,200
 answers that will determine

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,920
 whether you're gonna spend eternity with God or not,

171
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,720
 and answers that sadly most of our world

172
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,360
 and many people who even think that they're Christians

173
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,480
 have gotten and are getting wrong.

174
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,680
 So we're gonna be in verse one of chapter three,

175
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,040
 and the book of John is unique

176
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,720
 in that it is 90% different from the other gospels.

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,960
 So the four gospel accounts, Matthew, Mark, Luke,

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,200
 have striking similarities.

179
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,680
 And years after they were written,

180
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,960
 it's like the apostle John,

181
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,320
 who has this really intimate relationship with Jesus,

182
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,700
 decides, man, there were just some stories

183
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,080
 that I have got to write,

184
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,240
 and so the Holy Spirit leads him to write the book of John,

185
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
 and it gives us the interactions

186
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,180
 and the account of this man named Nicodemus,

187
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,440
 a man who would show up at the beginning of John

188
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,040
 and eventually show up at the end of John.

189
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,120
 So I'm gonna start in verse one,

190
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,600
 and we'll get started from there.

191
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,800
 Now, there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus.

192
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,040
 Now, a Pharisee, you probably,

193
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,560
 I'll unpack a little bit more in a second,

194
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,200
 but Pharisees, here's also you get a note,

195
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,920
 they were of an incredibly exclusive club.

196
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,200
 In a city of a million people,

197
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,020
 there were 6,000 Pharisees, that was it.

198
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,280
 They were professional religious leaders.

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,040
 In other words, they had made their devotion to God

200
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,880
 so abundant that they did it for a living.

201
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
 And this was one of them, one of the exclusive 6,000.

202
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,240
 He was also a member of the Jewish ruling council.

203
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,440
 Now, in a city that large,

204
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,720
 there's unique to be 6,000 or one of the 6,000 Pharisees,

205
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,520
 but now we're told he's a member of the ruling council,

206
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,400
 which would be equivalent in some ways

207
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
 to the United States Senate.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
 It was the ruling, there was 70 men

209
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,200
 who made up the ruling council.

210
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,580
 So we know Nicodemus is very religious,

211
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,020
 and he's also very respected and connected

212
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,580
 to have that high of a level of authority.

213
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,880
 And he came at night to see Jesus.

214
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,560
 And he said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher

215
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,640
 "who has come from God,

216
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
 "for no one could perform these signs that you were doing

217
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
 "if God were not with him."

218
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
 And we're told another interesting thing.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,540
 So Zacchaeus is religious, he's respected.

220
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,940
 In the Talmud, basically a historical book at the time,

221
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,920
 we're told he's one of the three richest men

222
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,320
 in the city of Jerusalem.

223
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,100
 So he's got riches, he's got respect, he's got religion,

224
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,740
 and yet he's curious about Jesus.

225
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,700
 And so he doesn't wanna show all of his cards,

226
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
 so he comes at night.

227
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,860
 Why is that significant?

228
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,440
 If you were a rabbi going to another rabbi,

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,560
 you'd come in the day.

230
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,820
 But Nicodemus is a little insecure

231
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,340
 about being seen in the daylight,

232
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,520
 and so he goes and he shows up to Jesus,

233
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,960
 and he begins to say, "I don't know quite who you are,

234
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,040
 "but no one could do what you're doing

235
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,020
 "if you weren't from God."

236
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,700
 And without even getting to his question,

237
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,940
 Jesus answers it and says this, verse four.

238
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,780
 Or verse three.

239
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,940
 "Very truly, I tell you,

240
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,740
 "no one can see the kingdom of God

241
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,660
 "unless they are born again."

242
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,540
 And Jesus, before he ever asks anything,

243
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,540
 he says, "You will never see the kingdom of God."

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,380
 The way he's at work in this life and in eternal life.

245
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,600
 "Unless you have another birth."

246
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,540
 And Nicodemus is, understandably, he's confused.

247
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,340
 What does that even mean?

248
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,580
 "How can someone be born when they're old?"

249
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,360
 Nicodemus asks.

250
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,080
 "Surely they cannot enter a second time

251
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,140
 "into their mother's womb to be born."

252
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,780
 Which is a mental image nobody wants to have.

253
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,620
 Verse five, "Jesus answered."

254
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,840
 Jesus is thinking it's a metaphor.

255
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,380
 It's a metaphor.

256
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,460
 "Very truly, I tell you,

257
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,220
 "no one can enter the kingdom of God

258
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,620
 "unless they are born of water," physical birth,

259
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,100
 "and the spirit," a spiritual birth.

260
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,180
 "Flesh gives birth to flesh,

261
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,160
 "but the spirit gives birth to spirit."

262
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,100
 In other words, humans give birth to humans,

263
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,300
 dogs give birth to dogs, cats to cats,

264
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,920
 and the spirit to spirit.

265
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,460
 And he highlights, and Nicodemus is hearing

266
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,860
 for the very first time,

267
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,180
 that maybe where he stands with God

268
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,220
 and the kingdom of God is not where he thought.

269
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,220
 Because Jesus is confronting him with the truth

270
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,260
 that Nicodemus, and it's a truth

271
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,180
 that maybe you at somewhere would say

272
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,080
 you kinda know but don't fully believe.

273
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,220
 Being good doesn't make you good enough for heaven.

274
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,820
 Being good doesn't make you good with God.

275
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,140
 I mean, I want you to think about this man.

276
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,860
 I mean, he's sitting across the table,

277
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,420
 and he thinks, you know, there's this one teacher,

278
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,860
 and I'm a teacher, and I got a lot of authority,

279
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,860
 and this new guy, and maybe we'll share some ideas together.

280
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,340
 And Nicodemus has spent his entire life devoted to God.

281
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,180
 We think of the Pharisees,

282
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,060
 and we kinda think of like the Klingons,

283
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,460
 or like the arch-nemesises,

284
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,740
 and the bad guys in Star Wars, whoever that is.

285
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,240
 But we think of them as like these bad guys,

286
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,700
 but they were men who, if you met 'em today,

287
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,100
 they'd be at church every week.

288
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,340
 They were generous with their money.

289
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,660
 They had memorized, the Pharisees,

290
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,940
 the first five books of the Old Testament.

291
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,900
 That's Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.

292
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,820
 And your journey through the Bible,

293
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,380
 if you do that, and you're reading each year,

294
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,700
 and you're going through,

295
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,140
 most of us struggle to get through

296
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,780
 those five books of the Bible.

297
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,700
 I mean, we hit Leviticus sometime in April,

298
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,980
 and we're like, oh, I'm just gonna go to Luke again.

299
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,280
 And these men had memorized.

300
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,560
 And in other words, we think of them as like,

301
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,840
 oh, those bad guys.

302
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,200
 At the time, they weren't thought of as bad guys.

303
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,720
 If your son grew up to be a Pharisee,

304
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,880
 it was like, man, you were winning,

305
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,860
 because you had raised someone

306
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,720
 that had devoted their life to God.

307
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,080
 And Nicodemus is being told,

308
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,040
 "You think God accepts you

309
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,660
 "because of what you've done.

310
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,520
 "No, no, no, you see the kingdom of God by birth, not work.

311
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,340
 "You will see the kingdom of God by a new spiritual birth,

312
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,860
 "not religious works."

313
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,120
 And he's sitting there, and he's trying to compute it.

314
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,560
 But Jesus is in the most loving way possible.

315
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,100
 He's trying to define the relationship

316
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,660
 and bring clarity to Nicodemus.

317
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,920
 Like, you've spent your whole life,

318
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,300
 and you've missed it.

319
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,700
 What do I mean by define the relationship?

320
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,020
 I mean, if you think in terms of dating relationships,

321
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,820
 there's that moment in every dating relationship

322
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,220
 where eventually you get to a place where you have the DTR,

323
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,700
 the define the relationship.

324
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,640
 What does this look like?

325
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,420
 It's when that stage where you've gone on a few dates,

326
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,260
 maybe four, maybe three, maybe five, wherever you're at.

327
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,280
 I'm not talking to you specifically, or maybe I am,

328
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,140
 but point being, you're in that dating stage,

329
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,980
 and you finish up that date.

330
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,420
 And almost always, for whatever reason,

331
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,340
 this happens in the car.

332
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,220
 You pull up to their apartment or their house,

333
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,340
 and the two of you are sitting there,

334
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,820
 and you're just kind of making chit-chat

335
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,840
 before you wrap up and just say,

336
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,580
 "Man, this was great, and it's so good to see you."

337
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,900
 And you're talking, and, you know,

338
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,780
 "I got this big presentation tomorrow at work,"

339
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,620
 and blah, blah, blah.

340
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,340
 Inevitably, you kind of stumble into this conversation.

341
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,940
 It may happen like, you know,

342
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,260
 one of your phone gets a text,

343
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,940
 and it's one of your girls texting you,

344
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,420
 and she's like, "How did it go with Kevin?

345
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,260
 "Was it good?

346
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,080
 "I just wanted to know."

347
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,500
 And Kevin's like, "Oh, I just saw my name

348
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,340
 "mentioned on there.

349
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,620
 "I'm just saying, I'm nothing."

350
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,460
 And they're just always like,

351
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
 "What's going on with you guys?

352
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,300
 "Are you all like a thing?

353
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,140
 "Are you talking?

354
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,960
 "Are you dating?

355
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
 "Was it just like nice?"

356
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,120
 And he's like, "Oh, man, my guys are always like that too.

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,020
 "They're like, 'You and Kelly, like, what is that?'"

358
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,860
 And you're talking, you're backing forth,

359
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,840
 and inevitably, one of you will go,

360
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,100
 "What'd he say?"

361
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
 (audience laughing)

362
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,360
 And based on how you answer that question,

363
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,980
 it's gonna have some serious ramifications

364
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,300
 for where you two are headed.

365
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,000
 You are either gonna go,

366
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,840
 "What do you mean, what'd I say?

367
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,060
 "I say you're Kelly."

368
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,140
 And the friend zone begins,

369
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,640
 or you're gonna say,

370
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,940
 "You know, I say, like, you know, we're just dating,

371
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,480
 "but I'd like you to be my girlfriend."

372
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,460
 And you're in, and you have defined the relationship.

373
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,900
 And Jesus, in the most loving way possible,

374
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,140
 is trying to bring clarity

375
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,020
 to define the relationship, Nicodemus.

376
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,020
 You spent your whole life trying to be good for God,

377
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,900
 thinking being good will make you good with him,

378
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,820
 and you've bought a lie,

379
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,260
 because you will never see heaven

380
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,600
 by how good of a person that you are.

381
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,640
 It comes from a spiritual birth,

382
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,420
 and the analogy of a spiritual birth is pretty brilliant,

383
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,980
 because being a father of three,

384
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,700
 I haven't seen my own kids go through three,

385
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,980
 there's some striking and fascinating similarities

386
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,620
 to the spiritual birth and how it takes place.

387
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,820
 Perhaps one of the more perplexing things

388
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,040
 when I think about physical, actual having kids birth,

389
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,500
 is the disproportionate load God has distributed

390
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,540
 to the father and the mother in terms of carrying the child.

391
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,380
 What do I mean?

392
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,780
 I mean, the mom has to have,

393
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,220
 she goes through morning sickness,

394
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,860
 she gets uncomfortable, she's getting pregnancy pillows,

395
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,140
 she goes through all of, like, the body changing,

396
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,060
 and this is all before even the delivery

397
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,260
 of all that takes place there,

398
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,900
 and all of the ways that she is carrying the load

399
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,100
 of bringing this child into the world,

400
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,140
 and then there's the dad's contribution,

401
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,000
 which is the thing he wants to do

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,580
 and thinks about all the time anyways.

403
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,580
 And yet, perhaps most perplexing of all,

404
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,160
 is the contribution that is even less,

405
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,100
 and that's of the baby.

406
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,860
 In other words, in your birth, in my birth,

407
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,060
 physical birth of any child,

408
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,680
 the child has nothing to do with deciding and willing

409
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,680
 and being the one who is responsible for that birth.

410
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,100
 It's his parents.

411
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,980
 And in a spiritual sense, that's what Jesus is saying.

412
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,740
 Flesh gives birth to flesh.

413
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,440
 Being able to see the kingdom of God

414
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,440
 is an act only the spirit of God can produce.

415
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,380
 And he's talking about the miracle of, you know,

416
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,900
 theology or seminaries and basically masters

417
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,160
 in Bible schools we'll call regeneration,

418
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,220
 of being made this new life that God births.

419
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,820
 And Nicodemus is realizing every category

420
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,140
 and understanding of who God is is being exploded,

421
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,620
 and realizing, man, being good

422
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,900
 doesn't make you good with God.

423
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,780
 And here's where this hits home, I think, in the room.

424
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,400
 There's certain of us that think, man,

425
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,580
 God's love for me or my relationship with him

426
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,180
 or my ability to show up and feel like I'm good with God

427
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,780
 is dependent on how well I've been doing recently.

428
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,580
 How much my church attendance,

429
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,280
 whether or not I'm still looking at pornography

430
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,980
 or whether or not I'm still messing up sexually,

431
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,060
 all of which are commands that God gives,

432
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,380
 not for you to earn his love,

433
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,920
 but to experience his love.

434
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,420
 But those are not the reason or basis

435
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,560
 we can have a relationship with God.

436
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,340
 So there's that camp that think, man,

437
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,360
 if I'm good, then I'm good with God.

438
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,300
 And then there's the other camp,

439
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,900
 and I think this is more common in my experience,

440
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,460
 of people who think, oh, man, that sounds so good.

441
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,420
 Oh, you just don't know what I've done.

442
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,580
 And you're still believing the same lie.

443
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,340
 It's your behavior that determines your ability

444
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,140
 to have a relationship with God

445
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,540
 or to have eternal life.

446
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,080
 And Jesus, he's just getting started,

447
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,040
 but he's just blowing the categories, Nicodemus.

448
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,480
 You've been wrong.

449
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,200
 And then in verse 70, he says,

450
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,680
 you shouldn't be surprised at my saying

451
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,820
 you must be born again.

452
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,140
 The wind blows wherever it pleases.

453
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,180
 You hear its sound,

454
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,920
 but you cannot tell where it comes from

455
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,760
 or where it's going.

456
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,040
 So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.

457
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,760
 He says, just like you feel the wind blowing

458
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,320
 against the trees or against yourself,

459
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,060
 there's things you don't fully understand,

460
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,480
 and they're undeniably real.

461
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,880
 So it is when the Spirit of God

462
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,000
 begins to impact someone's life.

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,320
 And then verse nine,

464
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,840
 and he's gonna tell us the evidence

465
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,900
 of that new birth in someone's life.

466
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,680
 How can this be, Nicodemus asked.

467
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,360
 Jesus said, you are Israel's teacher,

468
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,780
 and do you not understand these things?

469
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,820
 This is the ultimate, do you even lift, bro?

470
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,680
 You are Israel's teacher?

471
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
 Like, you're not just a teacher,

472
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,840
 you are the teacher of Israel.

473
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,800
 You're the guy everyone wants to listen to your podcast,

474
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,440
 your TED Talk explodes.

475
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,720
 People wanna know your advice on things.

476
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,240
 They wanna know some people's advice on different things.

477
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,680
 Everyone wants to know your advice

478
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,080
 when it comes to anything spiritual.

479
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,100
 And you don't understand this.

480
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,280
 And Nicodemus is realizing his understanding of God

481
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,720
 is not what he thought.

482
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,900
 Very truly, I tell you, verse 11, Jesus says,

483
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,080
 we speak of what we know and testify to what we've seen,

484
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
 but you don't accept it.

485
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,540
 I've spoken to you of earthly things,

486
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,120
 and you do not believe.

487
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,760
 How will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?

488
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,060
 No one has ever gone into heaven

489
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,140
 except the one who came from heaven, the Son of Man.

490
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,980
 Basically, you don't understand this.

491
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,100
 There's not a lot more deep I can go with you.

492
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,180
 And then he gives the hinge point.

493
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,420
 Basically says, Nicodemus,

494
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,080
 let me break it down a step further.

495
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,140
 Just as Moses, verse 14,

496
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,940
 lifted up a snake in the wilderness.

497
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,460
 Okay, let me hit pause here.

498
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,180
 He just said, just, Jesus is sitting across,

499
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,820
 Nicodemus is sitting there going,

500
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
 okay, I'm trying to follow.

501
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,100
 He says, all right, let me give you an illustration.

502
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,980
 And Jesus references a story he would have known all about.

503
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,580
 It's a story in the book of Numbers

504
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,180
 that Nicodemus had memorized.

505
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,260
 And he references this random kind of obscure story

506
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,460
 that if you're not familiar with a lot of the Old Testament,

507
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,580
 you probably, maybe you've never even heard of.

508
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,260
 And he references this time in Israel's history.

509
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,220
 Israel's the people of God in the Old Testament.

510
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,780
 And they were out in the desert,

511
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,500
 and there were these serpents that showed up,

512
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,060
 and this nation was being attacked

513
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,820
 by this huge horde of serpents.

514
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,460
 And they were getting bit, and they were dying,

515
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,180
 and they cried out to Moses.

516
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,540
 And they said, do something.

517
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,260
 And Moses, we're told in the story,

518
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,120
 this is what Jesus is referencing.

519
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,500
 Moses goes, and he pleads to God, what should I do?

520
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,340
 And God says, I want you to take a staff

521
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,740
 and put a rod on it, and I want you to put a serpent

522
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,060
 made out of bronze on the rod,

523
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,740
 and I want you to put that in the middle of the camp.

524
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,260
 And anyone who's been bit that looks at that will be healed,

525
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,920
 and their life will be spared.

526
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,620
 And Nicodemus is hearing this story,

527
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,780
 and he would be very familiar.

528
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,640
 To you, you read past that, and it's like,

529
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,980
 did he just mention serpents?

530
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,420
 I knew this was not the church for us, okay?

531
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,140
 That's not really the point.

532
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,200
 The point is, just like in that scenario

533
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,180
 where this staff and rod was lifted up,

534
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,420
 and anyone who looked was healed.

535
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,620
 He's about to tell us, so it will be with him,

536
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,320
 but I want you to see a picture

537
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,400
 of what it would have looked like,

538
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,400
 of that cross being on a rod with a snake.

539
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,600
 This is an actual picture from 2,000 years ago.

540
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,800
 And that's not, (audience laughing)

541
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,720
 this is a joke, guys.

542
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,560
 Okay, tough crowd.

543
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,400
 And Jesus says, just like in that moment,

544
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,760
 verse 15, "So the Son of Man must be lifted up

545
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:45,120
 "that everyone who believes or trusts in him

546
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,780
 "may have eternal life in him."

547
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,760
 Now, Nicodemus, he's still confused.

548
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,720
 We kinda see the foreshadowing and know what's coming.

549
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,600
 He's sitting there going,

550
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,620
 I don't know what you're talking about.

551
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,920
 Just like a serpent was lifted up in the desert,

552
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,200
 so the Son of Man, what does that even mean?

553
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,120
 And then Jesus dropped these two bombs

554
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,560
 that would have gone, what?

555
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,120
 He said that everyone who believes.

556
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,240
 Everyone?

557
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,800
 In other words, Nicodemus,

558
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,920
 you're so all about the Jewish nation,

559
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,400
 and you're so focused on God's heart,

560
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,120
 you've bought the idea that God's heart

561
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,360
 is really just for the Jewish people,

562
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,840
 that he loves kinda all people generally,

563
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,100
 but really God's in heaven, like, yes, let's go Jews.

564
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,920
 Give me a J, give me an E, give me a W.

565
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,120
 Jews, those are my people, I'm all about it.

566
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,240
 And Jesus just said, no, no, no, no.

567
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,740
 God's heart is for everyone who believes

568
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,720
 in the Son of Man lifted up.

569
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 Not who behaves for the Son of Man who was lifted up.

570
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:59,040
 Are you saying it comes down to belief or to trusting?

571
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,040
 And John, who wrote the book of John, I love this,

572
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,400
 he's telling the narrative,

573
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,720
 and he's writing it to his audience,

574
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,400
 who would later read it and walk through it.

575
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,240
 And John knows that Nicodemus may not fully understand,

576
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,000
 but John sees the big, full picture,

577
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,200
 so John wants to step out of the dialogue and the narrative

578
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,800
 to punctuate what's happening.

579
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,560
 And he writes this sentence,

580
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,600
 and it's arguably the most famous sentence in human history.

581
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,780
 And John pens 26 words that would reverberate

582
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,300
 through the halls of time ever since they were written.

583
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,000
 They would be placed on the eye block of NFL players,

584
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,720
 on the bottom of In-N-Out cups,

585
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,240
 on the bottom of Forever 21 bags,

586
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,000
 shown in Super Bowl commercials.

587
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,720
 And he says, "Man, let me punctuate for the reader."

588
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,880
 This is what God is saying.

589
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,580
 This is what Jesus is pointing to.

590
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:57,680
 For God so loved the world,

591
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,320
 He was so moved by love

592
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,160
 that He gave His one and only Son,

593
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,440
 the one who would be lifted up,

594
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
 that whoever believes in Him

595
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,600
 shall not perish but have eternal life.

596
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,880
 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn it,

597
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,040
 but to save the world through Him.

598
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,760
 And John says, "You're gonna get to the end of the story.

599
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,920
 "Nicodemus doesn't understand.

600
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,360
 "The Son lifted up like a serpent."

601
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,200
 What does that mean?

602
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,760
 And John goes, "God so loved the world

603
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,860
 "that He was sending His Son to be the payment and Savior

604
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,900
 "through His payment of His life on the cross

605
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,460
 "for anyone who would accept His payment for their sin."

606
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,060
 And Nicodemus is exposed to the second truth,

607
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,020
 that trusting in Jesus as your Savior

608
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,000
 is the only way to get to heaven.

609
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,700
 In other words, how do you know if you've been reborn?

610
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,120
 Because the Bible says,

611
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,540
 "Only those who are reborn will have eternal life."

612
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,620
 And then it says, "And only those who believe in Jesus

613
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,200
 "as the payment and Savior for them,

614
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,880
 "a payment of their sin and resurrection from the dead

615
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,140
 "will have eternal life."

616
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,140
 As in, you know you're reborn

617
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,300
 if you have put your faith, your trust in Jesus

618
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,380
 as your Savior and the payment for your sin.

619
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,940
 Trusting in Jesus as your Savior

620
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,260
 is the only way to get to heaven.

621
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,360
 And I'm gonna move quick through this,

622
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,860
 but he introduces a Greek phrase, believes in.

623
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,000
 You know what's interesting?

624
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,820
 Prior to this expression or this verse,

625
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,280
 there is no record in Greek literature,

626
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,540
 which is what the New Testament was written in,

627
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,940
 if that phrase had been used.

628
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,780
 In other words, prior to that, they had believed that.

629
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,220
 "Hey, I believe that."

630
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,740
 And John says, "No, no, no, it's stronger than that."

631
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,940
 It's not just they believe that Jesus died

632
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,140
 on the cross for them.

633
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,560
 They believe that Jesus is alive.

634
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,780
 They believe that God is real.

635
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,780
 They have believed,

636
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,900
 or the same Greek word for believe is trust.

637
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,900
 They have trusted in Jesus as their Savior,

638
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,740
 as the payment for their sin.

639
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,780
 Those are the ones who will have eternal life.

640
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,100
 The Bible over and over and over teaches

641
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,260
 it's not good people in heaven and bad people in hell.

642
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,760
 It is forgiven people in heaven.

643
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,100
 And the only way you can have eternal life

644
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,860
 or be forgiven is to trust in Jesus

645
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,260
 as the payment for your sin.

646
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,500
 Which means if I think my sin is too big of a deal

647
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,060
 for God to have paid for on the cross,

648
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,340
 I'm believing my sin is stronger

649
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,860
 than the Savior of the world.

650
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,640
 If I think because of a past abortion, past sexual sin,

651
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,260
 past pornography, past things that make up your story,

652
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,260
 my story are gonna be beyond what God paid for in Jesus.

653
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,500
 Like that's too much.

654
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,320
 I gotta earn my way.

655
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,220
 I gotta do some good things if I'm gonna get back with God.

656
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,180
 I'm believing that the sin in my life

657
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,340
 is more powerful than the Savior God sent.

658
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,020
 And Nicodemus is being exposed.

659
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,800
 Man, you're playing a different game.

660
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,500
 God sent me to be a Savior.

661
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,060
 You know what it takes to receive a Savior?

662
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,900
 And this is why some of you

663
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,340
 will not spend eternity with God.

664
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,180
 You have to believe I am incapable on my own

665
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,960
 of doing what is required to have eternal life,

666
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,340
 which is to have a perfect life.

667
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,440
 And I believe that,

668
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,220
 and there's no amount of good things I could do

669
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,300
 that can make up for the mistakes that I've had.

670
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,420
 But the good news is you don't have to,

671
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,460
 which is why Jesus came into the world,

672
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,080
 to be your Savior, not your homeboy,

673
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,040
 not a teacher, the Savior.

674
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,120
 But for you to get to that place,

675
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,580
 you gotta go, man, I am incapable,

676
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,920
 and I wanna earn my way to God.

677
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,740
 I wanna try and I wanna work harder.

678
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,660
 That is not how you can have a relationship with God.

679
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,420
 It starts by accepting the free gift He paid on the cross.

680
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,940
 Everything you've ever done, past, present, sin,

681
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,760
 three decades from now,

682
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,080
 you don't even know you're gonna commit

683
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,680
 when you're a crotchety old man.

684
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,500
 All of it paid for.

685
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,300
 And you can golf clap for that, that's great.

686
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,860
 And Nicodemus is seeing what,

687
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,020
 a lot of people spend their whole life and don't realize.

688
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,500
 You'll never have eternal life apart from Him.

689
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,420
 And the only reason any of us ever get access

690
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,100
 to eternal life is not 'cause we deserve it.

691
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,580
 Because it's in spite of the fact that we don't deserve it.

692
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:13,480
 Honestly, it's similar to,

693
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,660
 like my son, he loves sporting events.

694
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,500
 And I've noticed something.

695
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,020
 When you go to a Dallas Stars game,

696
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,660
 or Mavs game, or Rangers game, or anything,

697
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,320
 they all require the same thing at the door to get in.

698
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,340
 A ticket.

699
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,820
 It's really bizarre.

700
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,700
 Show up, like, oh, we're gonna go to this game,

701
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,580
 and they're like, where's your tickets?

702
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,140
 You know, it's never worked.

703
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,540
 I've never been able to say,

704
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,020
 oh, sorry, we don't have tickets.

705
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,140
 But here's what you gotta know.

706
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
 I'm a really great guy, love this kid,

707
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,460
 we're nice people, pay my taxes, never killed anybody.

708
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,620
 And so what do you think?

709
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,700
 Can we get in?

710
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,340
 They, of course, like, you would know, would go,

711
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,620
 no, where's your ticket?

712
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,180
 And if I try to repeat, no, no, no, but you don't know,

713
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,060
 like, I've never cheated on my wife,

714
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,700
 you know, I'm not perfect, but I'm a pretty nice guy.

715
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,560
 Can we come in?

716
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,300
 They go, no.

717
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,180
 Because it doesn't matter about your,

718
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,460
 it doesn't work that way.

719
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,700
 The paradigm shift Nicodemus is having is Jesus saying,

720
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,140
 you point to your list of resumes, it doesn't work that way.

721
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,060
 You'll never be able to enter.

722
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,400
 And where this analogy breaks down is that ticket idea,

723
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,740
 really, once you get into a sporting event,

724
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,540
 your ticket, it's kind of worthless.

725
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,340
 But Jesus is so much more than a ticket to heaven.

726
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,180
 He's the means of transformation in this life,

727
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,460
 not just transportation to eternal life.

728
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,620
 And he, when you trust in him,

729
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,820
 he begins to change everything,

730
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,380
 but not because you've earned it or deserve it.

731
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,780
 And Nicodemus, he's sitting across,

732
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,620
 remember what he said?

733
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,720
 He said, rabbi, we know you're a teacher who comes from God.

734
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,580
 Rabbi is a Greek word for teacher.

735
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,580
 He says, teacher, we know you're a teacher from God.

736
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,340
 Nicodemus is also called a teacher.

737
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,060
 So he starts the conversation going,

738
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,260
 man, it's one teacher to another teacher.

739
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,780
 You've got some opinions, I've got my opinions.

740
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:11,180
 And Jesus is going, this isn't teacher to teacher.

741
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,060
 This isn't even teacher to student.

742
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,940
 This is savior to sinner.

743
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,700
 And that's why I'm here.

744
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:25,580
 And your rules and obedience following a teacher,

745
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,640
 that's religion.

746
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,640
 Trusting in a savior, that's relationship.

747
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,280
 And I'm not here for you to follow additional teachings,

748
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,360
 Nicodemus.

749
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,440
 And I know many of you,

750
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,200
 and I'm about to wrap up week after week,

751
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,480
 this hasn't hit home.

752
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,960
 And my prayer tonight is that if one person

753
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,940
 hasn't hit home,

754
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,420
 man, it would be worth every porch we've ever done.

755
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,160
 Because why do I say it doesn't hit home?

756
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,380
 I have conversations every single week down front.

757
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,920
 You know what often a lot of them look like?

758
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,400
 I say, man, this is, they'll ask a question

759
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
 or I wanna know more about this.

760
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,720
 And at some point I'll ask,

761
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,820
 hey, let me just ask you a question.

762
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,600
 It's kind of a bizarre out there question,

763
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,720
 but just curious and love to know.

764
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,640
 On a scale of one to 10,

765
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,600
 how confident are you that if you died today,

766
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
 which I hope doesn't happen,

767
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,000
 you'd go to heaven?

768
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,500
 10 being I'm totally confident,

769
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,760
 one being I'm not at all.

770
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,200
 And they'll answer and they'll say,

771
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,860
 you know, that's a good question.

772
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,560
 Five or seven, nine,

773
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,240
 all across the board, different answers people give.

774
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,040
 And then I'll ask another question.

775
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,980
 Seven, awesome.

776
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,840
 Why?

777
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,720
 And the most common answer looks something like this.

778
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,120
 Well, seven, well, because I, you know,

779
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,780
 I'm trying to, wrong answer.

780
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,360
 You and I standing before God and Him saying,

781
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,440
 why would you have eternal life?

782
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,640
 And answering and responding with any sentence

783
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,560
 that starts with because I

784
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,320
 will never be the answer.

785
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,720
 Because I on my own and you on your own,

786
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,880
 believe it or not, are incapable of bridging that gap.

787
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,220
 And it takes humility to say,

788
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,420
 I'll never be able to do that.

789
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,340
 But I accept you did on the cross

790
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,580
 what I could never do for me.

791
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,140
 And you died and you rose again, and I believe it.

792
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,520
 And if you are there, you can be a 10.

793
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,540
 Not because I, but I'm a 10 because Jesus.

794
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,820
 And I know exactly where I'm gonna spend eternity.

795
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,940
 At some point in this conversation,

796
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,780
 maybe it clicked, maybe it didn't.

797
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,660
 We're not told.

798
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,260
 We're told that Nicodemus leaves

799
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,940
 and no doubt he's wrestling, just curious,

800
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,180
 he's not sure, and he goes off.

801
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,700
 And fast forward a few chapters later,

802
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,860
 we're told the name of Nicodemus again.

803
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,580
 It's this time where Jesus is doing miracles

804
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,460
 and He's healing people.

805
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,420
 And He's teaching at the Feast of Booze.

806
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,700
 Think the Texas State Fair.

807
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,180
 Jesus is out at Texas State Fair.

808
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,860
 He's teaching, standing up on something.

809
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,060
 He's teaching everybody.

810
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,100
 And He just healed a guy on the Sabbath,

811
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,380
 which was a big don't do from the Pharisees perspective.

812
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,940
 And Jesus is becoming increasingly famous.

813
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,480
 And the religious leadership, that 70 men,

814
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,060
 that included Nicodemus, they get together

815
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,580
 and they go, this man must be stopped.

816
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,460
 We need to arrest him.

817
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,600
 Let's send the temple guard,

818
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,260
 which is like most equivalent to the mall cop or something.

819
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,340
 It's like, you guys are kind of staying in your lane

820
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,020
 at the temple, but we'll send you out there anyways.

821
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,540
 And so they go to arrest Jesus

822
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,940
 and they send him out there.

823
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,820
 Hours go by, the temple guard comes back,

824
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,300
 the Sanhedrin, that 70's waiting,

825
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,420
 going, we're gonna arrest Jesus.

826
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,140
 And the temple guard shows up and they don't have Jesus.

827
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,140
 And the Sanhedrin, that 70 men, goes, where is he?

828
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,620
 They're like, I've never heard anybody speak like this.

829
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,060
 It was like, it was powerful.

830
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,660
 Sanhedrin's going, you guys listened to a sermon?

831
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,240
 Like, yeah, I mean, it was really powerful.

832
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,260
 I mean, Carl gave his life to Jesus and that didn't happen.

833
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,540
 The point being, they begin to go,

834
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,200
 okay, this is unbelievable.

835
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
 Fast forward to chapter 11, and in chapter 11,

836
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,980
 Jesus raises a guy from the dead and it's decided

837
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,900
 he must be stopped at whatever the cost.

838
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,780
 And Nicodemus is watching all of this happen.

839
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,900
 And then one night, they send the temple guard out again.

840
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,840
 And Jesus is arrested in a garden.

841
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,700
 And he's there and he's praying.

842
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,540
 And Judas shows up with the temple guard

843
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,140
 and they take him back and they put him on trial.

844
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,740
 And they put the son of God on trial saying,

845
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,520
 who do you think you are?

846
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,900
 At the end of the trial, they declare with those 70 men

847
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,500
 among whom Nicodemus was present,

848
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,900
 he's guilty and deserving of death,

849
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,980
 but we can't kill anyone.

850
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,980
 So we'll hand him over to Pilate and ask for him to be killed.

851
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:06,660
 And if you're Nicodemus, and you're sitting there going,

852
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,620
 what has he done?

853
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,540
 But certainly Pilate's not gonna kill him.

854
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,660
 He stands Jesus before Pilate and Pilate says,

855
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,340
 what have you done?

856
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,820
 They say that you claim to be the king of the Jews.

857
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,140
 And Jesus says, my kingdom is not of this world.

858
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,900
 And Pilate says, this guy may be crazy,

859
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,220
 but he's not deserving of death.

860
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,160
 I'm just having beaten and release him.

861
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,860
 But the Jewish leaders, that 70 men,

862
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,140
 begin to incite the crowd.

863
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,660
 And in John chapter 19, they declare with a crowd around him

864
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,740
 in front of Pilate, if you release him,

865
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,480
 you are no friend of Caesar.

866
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,540
 From then on, verse 19, or verse 12 of chapter 19,

867
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,760
 Pilate tried to set Jesus free.

868
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,260
 The Jewish leaders kept shouting, if you let this man go,

869
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,520
 you are no friend of Caesar.

870
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:53,960
 Eventually, Pilate says, if you want him crucified,

871
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,020
 you can do that.

872
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,740
 And he's led away to be crucified.

873
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,500
 And I want you to think, you're Nicodemus,

874
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,180
 and you're seeing all of this happen.

875
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,500
 And this man that you went at night,

876
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,900
 and you're going, crucified?

877
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,760
 What has he done?

878
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,700
 He didn't crucify anybody.

879
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,860
 This was the worst of the worst, the murderers, rapists,

880
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,080
 people who had done things that society,

881
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,520
 there was no coming back from.

882
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,480
 What has he done?

883
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,320
 Healed the eyes of blind men,

884
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,680
 allowed people who'd never been able to walk to walk.

885
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,600
 He restored families back together when he healed lepers

886
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,900
 and let them go home.

887
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,240
 He raised someone from the dead.

888
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,860
 What has he done that's deserving of death?

889
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,760
 How can this be happening?

890
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,880
 And they lead him away, and he's crucified.

891
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,360
 And something happened,

892
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,640
 where it began to click in a way

893
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,140
 that was different for Nicodemus.

894
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,820
 And he went from, man, I'm a part of the 70,

895
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,020
 and they just led him away,

896
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,380
 to I am coming out in the open

897
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,220
 and associating with this man, Jesus.

898
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,260
 I'm not staying in hiding anymore.

899
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,880
 And after he's dead, Nicodemus, after Jesus dies,

900
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,180
 he goes and says, man, I don't care what it costs me.

901
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,980
 I'm associating with him.

902
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,360
 And he goes to Pilate, and a man named Joseph of Arimathea,

903
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,860
 John chapter 19, says this.

904
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:10,500
 They went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.

905
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,220
 Verse 38, now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus

906
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,680
 because he feared the Jewish leaders.

907
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,580
 With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.

908
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,780
 And who was with him?

909
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,780
 Nicodemus, the man who had visited Jesus earlier at night.

910
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,500
 And they took the body,

911
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,740
 and the blood of the savior of the world

912
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:37,100
 covered their hands, and they wrapped it up,

913
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
 and they buried him.

914
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,940
 And three days later, he would rise.

915
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,020
 Now, when did it begin to click?

916
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,140
 When did he go from, I'm afraid to be seen with you,

917
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,860
 to I will be performing your funeral?

918
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,100
 You don't exactly know, but perhaps it was.

919
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,940
 On that hill, where Jesus was prepared to be crucified,

920
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,740
 and Nicodemus shows up, and all he can see

921
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,940
 is the crowd around and the backs of people's head,

922
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,940
 and he's looking around, where could Jesus be?

923
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,940
 And then over the crowd,

924
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,060
 is raised up

925
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,540
 the miracle-working Messiah,

926
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,260
 the savior of the world.

927
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,700
 And maybe it began to click

928
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,700
 when the Son of Man is lifted up

929
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,940
 like Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert.

930
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:38,220
 Whoever believes and trusts in him,

931
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,220
 not what they've done, not what they will do,

932
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,980
 but him as the payment for their sin,

933
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,460
 they will have eternal life.

934
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,260
 And something happened where he goes,

935
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,060
 I'm not staying here anymore, I'm coming out in the open.

936
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,220
 In fact, church history tells us

937
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,300
 he went on to become a bishop,

938
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,780
 and eventually a saint recognized in the church.

939
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:06,340
 Now, whether or not Nicodemus,

940
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,100
 church history is accurate,

941
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,300
 the question is not did he receive Jesus, it's did you?

942
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,220
 And there's no more important question

943
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,980
 that you will ever ask or ever answer

944
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,740
 than that for the rest of your life.

945
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,100
 Have you accepted him as your Lord, your savior,

946
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,380
 the payment for your sin?

947
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,820
 And he was more than enough.

948
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,460
 Let me pray.

949
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,660
 And when I do, I wanna do something that we don't do often.

950
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,940
 And I just wanna invite anyone who has never,

951
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,460
 if you're not a 10,

952
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,500
 I wanna invite you to know that you can be a 10.

953
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,620
 I am 100% confident I'm gonna spend eternity with God.

954
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,660
 And anyone in the room who's never had a moment

955
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,060
 in their life where they've made the decision,

956
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,660
 I am putting my trust in Jesus

957
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,660
 as not the miracle man from long ago.

958
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,980
 He is the savior of my life, of my sin,

959
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,660
 of everything broken or wrong with me.

960
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,140
 And I accept you, God.

961
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,300
 And I wanna lead you in that prayer.

962
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,380
 And so I'm gonna pray.

963
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,140
 And then in a second, I'm gonna lead anyone

964
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,740
 that has not made that decision.

965
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,060
 And if there is one person, like I said,

966
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,300
 every porch we've ever done in history is worth it.

967
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,260
 There is nothing more important than you will ever answer.

968
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,620
 Father, I pray for anyone who has made that decision.

969
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,340
 You would deepen our love and affection for you.

970
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,980
 And I pray for anyone who hasn't.

971
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,940
 That tonight would be their night.

972
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,460
 And they would make that decision.

973
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,380
 And their eternity would be forever changed.

974
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,900
 And their life in this life would be forever changed.

975
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,500
 If you're in a room, if you're in the room

976
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,580
 and you're at a place where you know,

977
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,540
 I've never made that decision, or I'm not sure,

978
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,940
 I'm not confident, and I wanna be confident.

979
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,540
 I don't wanna wonder anymore where I stand with God.

980
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,180
 I wanna receive and accept the one who has lifted up for me

981
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,860
 as my savior.

982
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,340
 I just wanna invite you to raise your hand

983
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,180
 right where you are.

984
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,140
 I just wanna lead you in a prayer.

985
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,640
 And then I wanna pray for you.

986
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,300
 Wherever you're at right now,

987
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,260
 you just raise your hand up in the air.

988
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:05,900
 And there is no more defining decision you're gonna make.

989
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,860
 And I think God has you here for this reason.

990
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,820
 I see you all over the room.

991
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,740
 If that's where you are, let me just lead you in a prayer.

992
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,180
 And you can just pray to yourself this,

993
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,020
 Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.

994
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,380
 I am in need of a savior.

995
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,020
 And I accept you and what you did on the cross

996
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,860
 as payment for my sin.

997
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,140
 And your resurrection as proof

998
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,220
 that payment was more than enough.

999
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,580
 Would you take my life and use it?

1000
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,500
 And I receive the free gift of eternity

1001
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,580
 that is mine because of what you've done

1002
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,140
 out of the great love that you have for me and our world.

1003
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,940
 Amen.

1004
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
 Lord, I pray for these friends that just made that decision

1005
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,500
 that you would take the seeds of faith

1006
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,740
 and you would bury them deep into their heart.

1007
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,380
 Thank you for the fact that eternities right now

1008
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,980
 have changed all over the room.

1009
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,320
 I pray for eternities that are changing,

1010
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,540
 for people that are listening.

1011
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,180
 And we thank you the new life,

1012
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,980
 incredible gift that just happened,

1013
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,900
 that heaven has a celebration, Luke chapter 15 says,

1014
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,740
 that takes place when a single person decides

1015
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,620
 to receive that free gift.

1016
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,940
 And I pray for anyone in this room

1017
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,740
 who sadly has not made that decision

1018
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,580
 and has not accepted that free gift, God,

1019
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,420
 would you graciously bring them to the end of themselves?

1020
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,420
 And would they humbly just say, "God,

1021
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,700
 "I'm not gonna try to earn it, work my way there.

1022
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,020
 "I receive it."

1023
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,980
 We worship you in song, amen.

1024
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
