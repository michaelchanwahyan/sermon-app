1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,680
 - We recently moved into a rent house

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,380
 about a mile north of here, my family and I.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,660
 And it's always interesting getting to know

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,220
 a new neighborhood, getting to know new neighbors

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,060
 and whatnot.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,820
 And so as I would take the trash out

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,860
 through the garage in the back,

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,820
 there's a house across the alley

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,900
 and there's a large eight foot fence there

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,600
 and it's a newer home or a larger home.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,540
 And every time I go back there,

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,040
 no matter what time it is, it's like,

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,280
 (imitates thumping)

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,940
 And so like I went down out at 9 a.m.

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,640
 I'm like taking the trash,

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,320
 the, what do you call it, the dumpster kind of back there.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,880
 And it's like, (imitates thumping)

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,820
 And then I went back out at 11.30 p.m.

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,860
 (imitates thumping)

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,300
 And like these guys are partying all the time, man.

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,920
 And so I didn't really say anything.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,220
 I didn't think much of it.

24
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,860
 And then a couple of weeks go by

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,600
 and Monica's like, "Hey, have you ever noticed

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,300
 "that the house behind us is like constantly partying?

27
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,940
 "Like they have a nonstop party going on back there."

28
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,640
 And I was like, "I know it.

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,540
 "I thought the exact same thing."

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,780
 And so every single day I would go out there

31
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,580
 and there's just, (imitates thumping)

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,420
 And there's this party.

33
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,420
 And so I can, there's a fence,

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,520
 but I can see what's happening.

35
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,020
 Like there's people splashing around.

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,320
 I'll hear a conversation.

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,320
 They evidently have some sort of swing set.

38
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,720
 And so I see like my mind, yeah, 'cause that's fun.

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
 My mind is like painting the picture.

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,220
 I see the margarita machine.

41
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,460
 You know, I see the people.

42
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,500
 They're kind of walking around.

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,560
 Everybody's partying.

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,940
 And then I hear that they have a teenage daughter.

45
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,400
 And I'm like, "Oh man, they need to reign that girl in.

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,580
 "Like she is like nonstop pool party in the backyard."

47
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,040
 And so we kind of continue to joke about this.

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,420
 Like, "Hey, what's up with the party?"

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,180
 Like it's like this kind of running joke in our house

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,580
 that they have this nonstop party going on

51
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,860
 from sunup to sundown all the time.

52
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,160
 We're kind of sad we didn't get invited and whatnot.

53
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,900
 And so Monica walks out to the back one day

54
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,520
 through the garage.

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,540
 And the guy who owns the house, the dad is out.

56
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,260
 And he goes, "Hey, you must be the new neighbors."

57
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,100
 And she said, "Yeah, we moved in a little over a month ago."

58
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,140
 And he's like, "Oh, it's so great to meet you."

59
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,340
 And he goes, "Let me just start by apologizing

60
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,880
 "for the loud music."

61
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,120
 And she goes, "Oh, you know, it's cool.

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,940
 "You know, we like music.

63
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,780
 "It's all good."

64
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,620
 (congregation laughing)

65
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,620
 And he said, "My 15-year-old daughter has Down syndrome.

66
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,060
 "And she sits out back all day and it soothes her."

67
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,060
 And in a moment, the scene changed.

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,140
 Like what was actually happening behind the fence changed.

69
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,520
 I couldn't see past the fence.

70
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,660
 I couldn't see over there.

71
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,500
 And so what I did is I stayed over there,

72
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,360
 over here in my safe little place,

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,340
 in my little community, in my house.

74
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,580
 And I made judgment calls about what was happening

75
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,440
 on the other side of the fence.

76
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,440
 And I painted a reality there that was not a reality at all.

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,020
 In fact, there was a very, very different reality

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,520
 that was happening back there.

79
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,460
 And I think on the topic of homosexuality,

80
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,180
 this has happened by both parties.

81
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,680
 Those in the homosexual lifestyle,

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
 in homosexual communities, look at the church

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,400
 and make judgment calls of what's happening.

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,280
 And moreover, those in the church,

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,960
 look at those in that lifestyle.

86
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
 And though they can't see past the fence,

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,620
 though they won't engage into their world,

88
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,700
 they make judgment calls

89
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,920
 of what's actually happening back there.

90
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
 And so tonight, what I hope to do,

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
 what I hope the Holy Spirit does here

92
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,780
 as we bring down the fence,

93
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,540
 I hope we can see how the Lord wants us to love

94
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,840
 people not like us.

95
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,560
 And I hope that they would see our efforts

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,560
 and desire to love as Jesus would call us to love.

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,300
 As we move through the scriptures,

98
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,000
 I want you to know something up front.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,460
 You're going to hear things

100
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,260
 that you will certainly agree with.

101
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,520
 And most of you here tonight will hear things

102
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,620
 that you certainly don't agree with.

103
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,880
 I'm gonna ask you for something.

104
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,420
 I've noticed that we come to this topic

105
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,660
 with preconceived notions and preconceived ideas

106
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,960
 and agendas, and I just want a disarmament

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,060
 to happen right here.

108
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,440
 Would you set down your weapon?

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,280
 Would you set down your weapon and would you listen?

110
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,980
 And would you let the Holy Spirit instruct your heart?

111
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,400
 I pray that anything that I say that is not of God,

112
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,660
 you don't even hear.

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,520
 But anything that I say that is consistent

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,480
 with God's character and the scriptures,

115
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,200
 that it moves in your heart and it does indeed change us.

116
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,840
 And if you're here and you identify as gay,

117
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,360
 I imagine that as you hear this,

118
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,440
 you're like, dude, you don't even understand,

119
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,200
 to which I want to say, I am sure that I don't.

120
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,700
 But I wanna make a commitment to you.

121
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,920
 If you will listen to me for the next few minutes,

122
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,040
 if you will hang out, if you will not get up

123
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,640
 and leave, if you will not assume how it ends,

124
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,920
 if you will, I know that you have a message of love as well,

125
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,320
 if you will give me that love and respect,

126
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,360
 then I will take as long as it takes

127
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,560
 to meet with every single one of you

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,600
 until you help me understand.

129
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,220
 I, let me say that again, I will sit down with each of you.

130
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,640
 And I will listen with no agenda other than to listen to you

131
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,320
 so that you might help me understand,

132
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,800
 so that I might grow an understanding of where you're at,

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,560
 how you feel, how the church has potentially hurt you,

134
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,240
 or whatever it is that you would like to share, deal?

135
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,160
 The other day I shared the gospel with a friend,

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,360
 someone that the Lord had placed in my life,

137
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,040
 and he responded in a way that I did not anticipate,

138
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,800
 I didn't see it coming, he said, I believe in Jesus,

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,560
 I just don't believe that gay people are going to hell.

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,600
 And I said, well, I don't believe gay people

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,480
 are going to hell either.

142
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,040
 And he said, to hell you don't.

143
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,320
 I said, oh, well, tell me more of what I believe, bro,

144
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,640
 like that's interesting, like clearly you're a prophet.

145
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,360
 What is it exactly that I believe?

146
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,640
 And he goes, I know that the church believes

147
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
 that gay people are going to hell,

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,520
 and I said, well, it's interesting, I work at a church,

149
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,600
 and I believe that everyone's going to hell,

150
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,760
 except for those that have acknowledged the payment

151
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,840
 so that they can be with God forever,

152
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
 those who have acknowledged that God sent

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,200
 his only son, Jesus Christ, to die for their sins

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,560
 so that they can be given new life,

155
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,200
 life with him forever and ever in eternity.

156
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,000
 That's the gospel, that's the very gospel

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I just shared with you, now how do you hear in that gospel

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,040
 that homosexuals are going to hell, how did you hear that

159
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,200
 in what I just shared with you?

160
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,280
 And we began to talk, but I understand how the church

161
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,480
 has been misunderstood and even misspoke,

162
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,080
 not just misunderstood, but miscommunicated on this topic.

163
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,360
 We have cliches that are stupid, and we say things like,

164
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,320
 you know, God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,

165
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,800
 and that's not helpful.

166
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,960
 We say, hey, love the sinner, but hate the sin.

167
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,360
 But if you go out there, there's all kinds of instruction

168
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,600
 on how to hate the sin, but very little instruction

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,160
 on how to love the sinner.

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,840
 And so what are we doing tonight to love

171
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,320
 and to move past these ideas?

172
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,520
 There's a real tension for me tonight

173
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,680
 as I feel a burden to shepherd the church

174
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,560
 toward caring for those who identify as homosexual,

175
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,680
 as well as to care and to love for the person

176
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
 who identifies as homosexual.

177
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,800
 There's a tension there, it's very, very difficult to do.

178
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,400
 And so I understand why this is the topic

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,040
 that has torn the church apart, that's what they say.

180
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,320
 They say, hey, this is the topic that is going to cause

181
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,600
 the church to lose its voice, and I believe they're right.

182
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,880
 That probably is how this will play out,

183
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,640
 unless we figure this tension out,

184
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,200
 unless we figure how to navigate through this

185
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,320
 carefully and cautiously.

186
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,840
 So would you pray for me?

187
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,240
 Would you pray that the Lord would speak through me?

188
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,720
 And would you pray that Dallas is shaped

189
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,800
 through this message?

190
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,680
 We're in a series called Lyrics and Lies,

191
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,520
 we're looking at Macklemore's "Same Love" tonight,

192
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,200
 and I'll read to you the first part of the song.

193
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,680
 When I was in the third grade, I thought I was gay

194
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,120
 'cause I could draw, my uncle was,

195
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,200
 and I kept my room straight.

196
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,560
 I told my mom, tears rushing down my face,

197
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,240
 she's like, Ben, you've loved girls since before pre-K.

198
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,840
 Yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?

199
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
 Bunch of stereotypes all in my head,

200
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,720
 I remember doing the math, like, yeah,

201
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,960
 I'm good at Little League, a preconceived idea

202
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,840
 of what it all meant for those that liked the same sex.

203
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,440
 Had the characteristics, the right-wing conservatives

204
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,200
 thinks it's a decision, and you can be cured

205
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
 with some treatment and religion.

206
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,760
 Man-made rewiring of a predisposition playing God,

207
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,360
 oh, no, here we go.

208
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,680
 America the brave still fears what we don't know,

209
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,760
 and God loves all his children is somehow forgotten,

210
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,160
 but we paraphrase a book written 3,500 years ago,

211
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
 I don't know.

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,720
 And I will tell you that Macklemore as a heterosexual

213
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,280
 does an incredible job of bringing down the fence

214
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,280
 and allowing us as the church to see into this struggle.

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,720
 He gives us a mirror as the church,

216
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,440
 and he says, hey, this is what you're doing.

217
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,320
 He does an incredible job of allowing us

218
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,480
 to look past the fence, that's what he does well.

219
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
 And so tonight what I hope to cover

220
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,720
 is what the Bible actually does say about this topic,

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,080
 where we as Christians have missed it,

222
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,920
 and then before you leave here tonight,

223
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,960
 the change that is necessary.

224
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,080
 One that might surprise you, one that might not.

225
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,520
 And so we'll start with what does the Bible actually say,

226
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
 and what does it mean?

227
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,600
 This is gonna carry throughout the message,

228
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,520
 it won't be contained in this point

229
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
 as we'll continue to cover

230
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,920
 what the scripture says on the topic.

231
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
 But I will tell you that if the Bible

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,480
 is not authoritative in your life,

233
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,440
 you at least wanna listen to be educated,

234
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,680
 you can at least build your case

235
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,640
 against what the scripture says.

236
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,800
 Even if you don't trust it, even if you don't believe it,

237
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,320
 it is important that we all understand what the Bible says.

238
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,760
 This is a topic where you have to know where you stand,

239
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,200
 because if you don't know where you stand,

240
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,320
 you will be misrepresented by both sides.

241
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,800
 That is why this message is so important.

242
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,360
 And so we know that if you have studied the scriptures,

243
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,480
 that early in Genesis 19,

244
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,640
 you see a condemnation of homosexuality

245
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
 in what's going on in Sodom,

246
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,640
 where we actually get the word sodomy.

247
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,600
 This is before the law came out.

248
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
 This is the Old Testament.

249
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,720
 And so we see that, some say,

250
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
 well, the sin of Sodom was actually

251
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,640
 that they didn't care for the poor.

252
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,680
 That's true, that's one of the sins of Sodom,

253
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
 but the sin that Sodom is most known for

254
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
 is actually this act of homosexuality,

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
 otherwise known as sodomy,

256
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,640
 where we get that name from the very town.

257
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,840
 And so then the Old Testament law comes in Leviticus 18.

258
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,400
 And so bear with me, 'cause I'm going Old Testament on you.

259
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,240
 Leviticus 18, verse 22, it says,

260
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,960
 "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman.

261
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,200
 "It is an abomination."

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,560
 And then again, in Leviticus 20, verse 13, it says,

263
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,520
 "If a man lies with a male as with a woman,

264
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,680
 "both of them have committed an abomination.

265
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,480
 "They shall surely be put to death.

266
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,520
 "And when they be put to death, their blood is upon them."

267
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,640
 And the argument against this looks something like this.

268
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,760
 Well, if you believe in the Old Testament law,

269
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,640
 then why do you eat shellfish?

270
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,160
 Why do you eat pork?

271
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,400
 And why do you get a bald fade

272
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
 like the one I'm representing right now?

273
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,880
 Why do you shave the side of your heads?

274
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,600
 Because all of that is Old Testament law,

275
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,080
 and they're absolutely right.

276
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,960
 We do not obey the Old Testament law anymore.

277
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,600
 Jesus came and he abolished the law.

278
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,040
 That's what the scripture tells us.

279
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,560
 It's a really sound argument, or at least half of it,

280
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,880
 where it comes from, the argument that it makes is true.

281
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,200
 Romans 10, verse four, it says,

282
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,280
 "Christ is the culmination or end of,"

283
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,800
 that's what that word means,

284
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,160
 "Christ is the end of the law,

285
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,040
 "so that there may be righteousness

286
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,440
 "for everyone who believes."

287
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
 Now, there is the moral law that shows up

288
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,680
 in the New Testament, which the Spirit guides us through.

289
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,040
 The moral law is things like don't kill, don't steal,

290
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,840
 don't marry your father and mother,

291
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,240
 don't commit adultery, things around sexuality.

292
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,920
 This law reappears throughout the New Testament.

293
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,600
 This is what marks the follower of Jesus Christ,

294
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,800
 that his Spirit, the law that is now written on our hearts,

295
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,120
 that he would live that law out in our lives.

296
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,920
 And so homosexuality actually shows up

297
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,080
 in the New Testament in Romans one,

298
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,800
 in 1 Timothy one, verses nine through 11,

299
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,000
 and in 1 Corinthians six,

300
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,640
 be for the rest of our time this evening.

301
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,600
 But I want you to see a verse, it's John one, verse 17.

302
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,360
 It says, "For the law was given through Moses.

303
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,820
 "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."

304
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,360
 The law, that which we looked at in Leviticus,

305
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,600
 which we certainly do not obey,

306
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,840
 we're not putting people to death,

307
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,360
 and we're not saying, "Hey, you can't go eat at Red Lobster."

308
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,560
 Not sure why you'd want to, but you shouldn't.

309
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,400
 (congregation laughing)

310
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,520
 You can if you want to.

311
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,240
 "For the law was given through Moses.

312
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,960
 "Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."

313
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,560
 If we have missed this, if you have missed this,

314
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,060
 let me make this personal, if I have missed this,

315
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,700
 if I have missed out on the topic of homosexuality,

316
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,620
 if I have misled, if I have mistaught,

317
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,960
 if I have misinterpreted,

318
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,760
 it has been in one of these two areas, grace or truth.

319
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,720
 Jesus came and brought grace and truth.

320
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,840
 And some of you are here, and you're like,

321
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,720
 "Truth, man, I love truth."

322
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,560
 And you're preaching truth, and some of you are here,

323
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,940
 and you hear grace, and you're like,

324
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,400
 "Oh yeah, grace," and you're preaching grace,

325
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,320
 but both of them are absolutely necessary.

326
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,520
 Grace and truth, full of grace, full of truth,

327
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,900
 that those two would be complete and exist together.

328
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,760
 Not one or the other, but both of them coexisting.

329
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,720
 And so what we've done is we've taken grace,

330
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,300
 and we've changed the definition

331
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,600
 to something called tolerance.

332
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,080
 We've taken grace, and we've moved it to tolerance.

333
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,520
 Saying, "Well, if I'm to be full of grace,

334
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,420
 "then I'm to tolerate sin.

335
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,100
 "I'm to love everyone and ask no one to change,

336
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,440
 "because that would be unloving."

337
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,780
 And we've taken truth,

338
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,660
 and we've redefined it to judgment.

339
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,780
 And we say, "Well, the Bible says that I'm to speak truth,

340
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,520
 "and so that allows me to bring judgment to everyone.

341
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,480
 "I can just go around and kind of determine

342
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,700
 "the fruit in people's life, and I can judge them,

343
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,940
 "and I can call out their sin, but there's no grace."

344
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,060
 It has to be both full of grace and full of truth.

345
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,100
 It's not tolerance for sin in the name of love,

346
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,140
 which is not love, and call that grace.

347
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,440
 Not judgment of sin outside the church,

348
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,880
 and losing your voice.

349
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,200
 We're not called to judge sin outside the church.

350
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,700
 We're called to judge sin inside the church.

351
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
 We're called to treat those outside the church

352
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,540
 by sharing the truth of the gospel.

353
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,640
 And so we point those outside the church

354
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,320
 to the grace of the gospel,

355
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,040
 and we point those inside the church

356
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,160
 to the truth of the Bible.

357
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,320
 Let me say that again.

358
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,100
 We point those outside the church

359
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,460
 to the grace of the gospel.

360
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,100
 That's the truth that we share

361
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,140
 with those outside the church.

362
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,660
 Did you know that Jesus loves you so much

363
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,220
 that he gave his entire life

364
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,820
 for everything wrong you've done

365
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,940
 so that you can be with God forever?

366
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,260
 And we take those inside the church,

367
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,540
 those who have trusted in Christ's death and resurrection,

368
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,380
 we say, "Hey, do you know what the scripture says

369
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,220
 "and how you might live your life,

370
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,740
 "that the Holy Spirit would conform your life

371
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,640
 "according to the scripture?"

372
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,460
 Macklemore says, "But we paraphrase a book

373
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,180
 "written 3,500 years ago."

374
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,300
 And so Macklemore is not just asking you

375
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,060
 to accept homosexuality.

376
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,220
 He's building a case against the Bible.

377
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,700
 He is essentially saying it's old and you can't trust it.

378
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,540
 And this is where I take issue with what Macklemore says.

379
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,500
 You cannot trust the Bible.

380
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,940
 And so Macklemore has forsaken books written 1,900 years ago,

381
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,780
 LBN 1, 1 Corinthians 6, verses nine through 11.

382
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,540
 To set this up, homosexuality was more normal

383
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,080
 than monogamous heterosexuality in this culture.

384
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,780
 The culture that this was written into,

385
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,260
 homosexuality was the absolute norm.

386
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,220
 In fact, 14 out of the first 15 emperors of Rome

387
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,260
 all had homosexual relationships.

388
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,580
 Let me say that again.

389
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,540
 14 of the first 15 emperors of Rome,

390
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,300
 all of them, 14 out of 15, had homosexual relationships.

391
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,100
 That is the culture that this is being written into.

392
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,100
 But as we look at this text, I want you to find your sin.

393
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,980
 There's a list of sins here.

394
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,100
 I want you to find yours.

395
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,360
 Do you not know that wrongdoers, that's all of us,

396
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,540
 everyone here has done wrong,

397
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,500
 wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God.

398
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,900
 That's really bad news

399
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,380
 'cause we wanna inherit the kingdom of God

400
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,120
 and we've all done wrong.

401
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,720
 So he must be trying to make a point here

402
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,900
 that's bigger than what it says right here.

403
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,180
 Do you not know that wrongdoers

404
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,660
 will not inherit the kingdom of God?

405
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,100
 Do not be deceived.

406
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,440
 Neither the sexually immoral, that's absolutely me,

407
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,020
 I've been sexually immoral.

408
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,480
 Okay, there's lots of sexual immorality in my past.

409
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,500
 There are days still today where I struggle with lust,

410
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,640
 which is sexual immorality, according to Jesus.

411
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,180
 Nor idolaters, that's the sin that I would circle for myself.

412
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,860
 I am very quick to bring idols before God.

413
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,700
 I am very quick to have something that I love in my life

414
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,660
 more than God in moments of my life.

415
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,860
 I'm an idolater.

416
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,720
 I struggle with idolatry.

417
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,520
 Nor adulterers, nor men who have sex with men.

418
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
 Now there's two words here

419
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,400
 that the NIV 2011 has interpreted

420
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
 as men who have sex with men.

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,600
 There's a lot of debate around these two words,

422
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,280
 two words in the Greek.

423
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,920
 One of them, it is a, if you are one sex,

424
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,400
 but you identify more as the other sex.

425
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,360
 So if you're like an effeminate male,

426
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,560
 that would be the first word.

427
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,500
 And the second word translates men who penetrate men.

428
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,040
 I know that's graphic,

429
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,080
 but that is how the word is translated

430
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,680
 as it is used in ancient Greek.

431
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,760
 So you have effeminate male and men who penetrate men.

432
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,840
 These are the two words.

433
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,020
 The second one is absolutely bulletproof.

434
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,280
 There's no redefining it.

435
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,800
 There's no misunderstanding it.

436
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,240
 That's what it means in every ancient Greek text

437
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,080
 that we look at.

438
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,040
 That's what it means.

439
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,400
 It is a word that encompasses all of homosexuality.

440
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,120
 In fact, both passive homosexuality

441
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
 and active homosexuality.

442
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,240
 Both the feeling and the action, if you will.

443
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,200
 They're both represented here in these two words.

444
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,120
 And then it goes on to say,

445
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,120
 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards,

446
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,480
 nor slanderers, nor swindlers

447
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,840
 will inherit the kingdom of God.

448
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,720
 It's bad news.

449
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,800
 If you stop there, it's really easy to understand

450
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,000
 how the church has missed it,

451
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,640
 saying stupid things like if you're gay,

452
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,480
 you're going to hell.

453
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,320
 That's not true.

454
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,120
 And it's a bad interpretation of this text.

455
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,040
 It is a misunderstanding of this text.

456
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,720
 The context of this text is all throughout,

457
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,640
 prior to that chapter in 1 Corinthians 6.

458
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,280
 And in 1 Corinthians chapter five,

459
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,000
 at the end of that chapter, verse 12,

460
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,360
 it tells us really clearly,

461
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,520
 what business is it of mine, Paul writes,

462
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,680
 to judge those outside the church?

463
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,400
 Are you not to judge those inside?

464
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
 Paul says, the context of this passage

465
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,720
 is those who are within the church

466
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,560
 should judge those within the church.

467
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,800
 But those who are within the church

468
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,200
 should not judge those who are outside the church.

469
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
 If they do not ascribe to, hey, the Bible is absolute truth

470
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,360
 and authoritative in my life,

471
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,040
 then why would they ever say,

472
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,560
 I'm going to live according to it?

473
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,880
 Some of you get so frustrated with those in your life

474
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,680
 that you work with that sin,

475
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,520
 but they haven't signed up to not sin

476
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,600
 or to follow the Holy Spirit

477
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 because they don't have the Holy Spirit.

478
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,880
 And that's foolish, that is a waste of frustration.

479
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,640
 And so the truth, again, as we cover what the Bible says,

480
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,240
 is that homosexuality is a sin,

481
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
 but it is a sin just like yours,

482
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,200
 just like my idolatry.

483
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,080
 In fact, if you're here

484
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,760
 and you're sleeping with someone outside of marriage,

485
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,920
 you are just as much in an offense to God

486
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,680
 as the one who struggles with homosexuality

487
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,800
 or the one who has given themselves to homosexuality.

488
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,720
 Do you understand that?

489
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,880
 You're just as much in offense to God as that one.

490
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,120
 And so the church must stop treating this sin

491
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,240
 like it's a special kind of sin,

492
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,160
 like it's some sort of unique sin,

493
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,000
 and understand that it is just like

494
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,040
 all of the sins of heterosexuality,

495
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,640
 just like the sins that I said that I struggled with.

496
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,240
 And so what Jesus did is he took the law

497
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,800
 and he raised the bar.

498
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
 The law said, don't kill.

499
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,240
 I say, if you treat someone poorly, you've committed murder.

500
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,320
 The law said, do not commit sexual immorality.

501
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 I say, if you look at someone lustfully,

502
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,240
 you're not married to, you've committed adultery.

503
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,680
 Do you see how Jesus takes the bar and he raises it?

504
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,160
 And he's saying, hey, you can't keep the law.

505
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,080
 Why would God give us the law if we can't keep the law?

506
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,120
 The law does three things.

507
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,960
 I'll just say a few things, okay?

508
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,240
 The one thing that the law does

509
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,240
 is it shows our deep, incredible need for a savior.

510
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,480
 God, I can't even do right.

511
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,960
 I need someone to save me from my sin.

512
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,960
 See, also Jesus Christ, the law protects us

513
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,920
 from that which would bring harm to us.

514
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,160
 God says, I love you, I've created you,

515
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,840
 and if you follow this law, it will lead to life,

516
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 life in me, and it shows us a way that we should live.

517
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,080
 And so we share the truth that it is a sin,

518
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,440
 but we share that out of love, not out of law,

519
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,040
 not from the law, but from love.

520
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,320
 And because the moral law is consistent

521
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,560
 with the character of God, when we break it,

522
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,840
 we bring harm to ourselves.

523
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,480
 That's the way God created the world.

524
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,720
 That's the way that he wired the world.

525
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,960
 And so I am well aware of, like when I sit here

526
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,280
 and I've gotten lots of angry emails

527
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,840
 and lots of angry phone calls from guys

528
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,200
 whose girlfriend broke up with them,

529
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,720
 'cause I'm sitting up here and I'm like,

530
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,840
 hey, you shouldn't be having sex.

531
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,880
 You know, we're sitting next to each other

532
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,480
 and it's super awkward, and I see the elbows sometimes

533
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,360
 and the tears sometimes from up here.

534
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,640
 I mean, you should see the view from up here.

535
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,520
 And so I get those emails,

536
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,480
 because whenever you start removing someone's idol,

537
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,160
 and they say, well, you don't understand how I feel.

538
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,680
 You don't know, I really, really wanna be

539
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,160
 in this relationship, but I talk to a girl

540
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,960
 who's in a physical relationship, and I say,

541
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,040
 hey, y'all need to break up,

542
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,320
 you need to give each other some space,

543
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,160
 and you both need to pursue Jesus separately,

544
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,440
 and he might bring you back together, he might not.

545
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
 And I see the tears, and I say, oh, man.

546
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,800
 I mean, I have gotten hate letters in that.

547
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,760
 When you start bringing down someone idols,

548
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,880
 but God has given us instruction,

549
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,080
 and that instruction is meant to lead us to life

550
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,200
 because God loves us.

551
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,320
 And so when we don't listen, it goes poorly.

552
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,680
 And so how does this apply to the issue of homosexuality?

553
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,600
 I'm gonna read to you some statistics.

554
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,400
 I want you to pay close attention to where they're from.

555
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,880
 These are not from Christianity Today,

556
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,400
 or watermark.org, or the porchdallas.com.

557
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,200
 These are from the American Public Health Association,

558
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,840
 from the CDC, from the Oxford Journal of Epidemiology.

559
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,920
 I will read them.

560
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,880
 Those who identify as homosexuals are 150% more likely

561
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,280
 to deal with depression, anxiety, and alcohol,

562
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,320
 or substance abuse.

563
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,360
 That comes from the American Public Health Association

564
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,080
 in 2013.

565
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,600
 The homosexual lifestyle includes

566
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,040
 a 200% higher rate of suicide.

567
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,520
 That comes from the American Public Health Association

568
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,080
 in 2013.

569
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,800
 And so the argument there is, well, that's because

570
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,000
 we live in a world that doesn't accept us.

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,720
 And so therefore, we wanna leave that world,

572
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,840
 and we're more prone to depression.

573
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,080
 And so they did a study.

574
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,440
 That study was done in the Netherlands,

575
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,160
 where the gay lifestyle is completely accepted,

576
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
 just as it was the heterosexual lifestyle.

577
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,600
 And what they have found is that there are higher rates

578
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,720
 of depression, bipolar, panic disorder, OCD,

579
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,760
 psychiatric disorders, among those who identify themselves

580
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,440
 as homosexual in the Netherlands.

581
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,960
 And so let's talk about disease for a minute.

582
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
 I wanna remind you right now that I'm sharing this

583
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,800
 out of love.

584
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,040
 My heart, my motive is love.

585
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,280
 And showing the danger of a specific activity

586
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
 as it relates to homosexuality.

587
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
 Disease, the 2005 Oxford Journal of Epidemiology found

588
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,940
 that 78% of homosexuals have at least one STD.

589
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,060
 The US Center for Disease Control in 2013 found,

590
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,360
 while only 3% of USA, America's population identifies

591
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,520
 as being homosexual, this group is responsible for,

592
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,500
 so this group of 3% is responsible for 50% of cases

593
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,180
 of syphilis, 60% of cases of gonorrhea,

594
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,840
 90% of homosexual men report chronic

595
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,780
 or recurrent viral infections.

596
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,700
 Over 75% of all HIV cases, so 3/4 of all HIV cases

597
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,180
 in the last five years are among the homosexual community.

598
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,020
 Why?

599
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,940
 Because we weren't created to do that.

600
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,820
 And whenever we go against God's law,

601
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,760
 there are consequences.

602
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,680
 Whenever we pursue feelings over that which he has commanded

603
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,840
 it is harmful to us.

604
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,760
 Did you know that AIDS, when it came out in 1982,

605
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,380
 was called GRID, Gay-Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome?

606
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,720
 That was the initial name for AIDS

607
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,280
 because they found the disease only existed,

608
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,980
 to the best of their research at the time,

609
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,680
 in these clusters of community

610
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,920
 that identified as homosexual.

611
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,080
 Later, the name, in the '80s, the name was changed to AIDS.

612
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,520
 Now, life expectancy.

613
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,580
 According to the 2005 Oxford Journal of Epidemiology

614
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,500
 and the American Obituary Report,

615
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 in homosexual, the age expectancy is 20 years shorter

616
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,700
 than their heterosexual counterparts.

617
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,280
 Only 1% of homosexual men die from old age.

618
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,160
 And some of this is because the rampant promiscuity

619
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,500
 in the homosexual lifestyle.

620
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,220
 Swedish gay male couple, David and Andrew Madison,

621
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,640
 did a study in the Journal of Sex Research.

622
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,180
 They studied 2,583 couples.

623
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,740
 Not a single couple sustained a monogamous relationship

624
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,300
 despite being openly married.

625
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,580
 Average number of partners was between 101 and 500.

626
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,140
 Male couples who identify as gay

627
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,940
 are 50% more likely to divorce,

628
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,820
 and couples who identify as lesbians

629
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,440
 are 167% more likely to divorce.

630
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,480
 And so you understand why there is a truth

631
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,680
 that we share because we love our brother and sister,

632
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,160
 not because we think they're weird,

633
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,800
 not because we think they're crazy,

634
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,300
 but because we love them and we desire life for them.

635
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,980
 And God says, "Hey, this is where life is found."

636
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,200
 Now, I wanna ask you a question.

637
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,440
 If you have a friend, someone you love very, very much,

638
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,400
 and they say, "Hey, I wanna take this pill.

639
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,960
 "I wanna swallow this pill."

640
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,660
 And you say, "Well, what will the pill do for you?"

641
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,420
 And they say, "Well, once I take it,

642
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,320
 "I'll be more likely to be anxious,

643
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,980
 "more likely to be depressed,

644
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,840
 "more likely to commit suicide,

645
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,700
 "more likely to get sick more often,

646
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,240
 "more likely to be promiscuous, more likely to divorce,

647
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,340
 "and I'm going to take two decades, 20 years off my life."

648
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,100
 (congregation murmurs)

649
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,860
 What is the loving response?

650
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,380
 I would tell you it depends.

651
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,020
 It depends if they're inside the church,

652
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,940
 you show them to the truth of the Scriptures.

653
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,280
 This is what the Bible says.

654
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,380
 If they're outside the church,

655
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,180
 you show them to the truth of the Bible,

656
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,020
 and you say, "You know what?

657
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,660
 "If you trust in this, you can live forever.

658
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
 "You don't have to cut off 20 years of your life.

659
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,740
 "If you trust that Jesus Christ has paid

660
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,920
 "for all the things you've done,

661
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,420
 "there's no shame in the kingdom.

662
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,260
 "You can live with God forever and ever and ever,

663
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,360
 "and 200, 2,000, 2 billion years from now,

664
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,380
 "you'll still be with him.

665
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,720
 "I'll be with you too.

666
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,820
 "We'll be together up there forever."

667
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,300
 There is forgiveness, man.

668
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,580
 You point those inside the church

669
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,620
 to the truth of the Scripture.

670
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,120
 You point those outside the church

671
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
 to the grace of the gospel.

672
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,220
 And you do it consistently.

673
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,700
 Over and over and over, you do that.

674
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,620
 I had a friend tell me,

675
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,980
 he says, you know, he's not a believer, he's an atheist.

676
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,480
 He said, "I love people just the way they are.

677
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,900
 "I don't want anyone to change.

678
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,280
 "And what happens when they're unhappy

679
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,220
 "is I don't know what to do."

680
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,580
 And so he was like sending people to me to meet with.

681
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,580
 And I said, "Why are you sending these people to me

682
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
 "to meet with them?"

683
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,820
 "Because you love them enough to call them to more.

684
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,580
 "I can only love them right where they're at.

685
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,480
 "You know, this is the way I'm wired.

686
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,560
 "I just want everybody to be happy.

687
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,780
 "I don't really want any awkward conversations.

688
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,780
 "But you love them enough to show them what could be.

689
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,640
 "You love them better than I do."

690
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,760
 Jesus took all the laws, over 600 of them,

691
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
 and he summarized them into two commands,

692
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,720
 love God and love people.

693
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,520
 He says, "In these, all of the laws are encompassed.

694
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,480
 "And so the compassion in you might say right now,

695
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,060
 "but JP, I'm born that way.

696
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,340
 "They're born that way."

697
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,880
 Among the scientific community,

698
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,380
 there is no supported evidence that people are born gay.

699
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,880
 I don't know if you knew that.

700
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,660
 But I would tell you that I have a strong inclination

701
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,180
 to think that there probably are born

702
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,740
 with a predisposition to be gay,

703
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,020
 or the possibility for it anyways.

704
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,660
 Rick Warren was in a recent interview,

705
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,820
 or it was in an interview,

706
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,100
 I don't know how recent it was,

707
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,900
 and the angry reporter said,

708
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,340
 "Would you believe that homosexuality is still a sin

709
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,500
 "if they found the gay gene,

710
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,900
 "if they found that people were born gay?"

711
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,880
 To which Rick Warren said, "Absolutely.

712
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,800
 "I would still say that it's a sin."

713
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,300
 And she said, she was really upset,

714
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,140
 and she said, "Why?

715
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,420
 "How can you say that?"

716
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,860
 And he looks at her and he goes,

717
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,200
 "Because I want to have sex

718
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,240
 "with every beautiful woman I meet."

719
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,160
 But no one would argue that that's what's best for society.

720
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,100
 But that is what I want.

721
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,700
 That is my strong inclination.

722
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,220
 That is my strong feelings.

723
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,780
 That is my desire.

724
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,460
 But no one would argue that that's

725
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,900
 what is best for everyone.

726
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,040
 And so I think that we're born on a gender spectrum.

727
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,820
 Some of us are born more masculine males than others.

728
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,980
 Some of us are born more feminine females than others,

729
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,820
 and there's a spectrum.

730
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,460
 And I believe that amongst that spectrum,

731
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,620
 as we kind of move across it, there is confusion.

732
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,500
 I believe that there are things that can happen to you

733
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,740
 at an early age, early exposure to sex

734
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,980
 that can cause further confusion.

735
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,820
 I believe that men, you know,

736
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,220
 might be more attracted to men than women.

737
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,820
 And as they move through adolescence,

738
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,160
 and as their body starts to produce hormones

739
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,380
 at 600%, the normal rate,

740
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,820
 and that is when we actually bond.

741
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,620
 Because nobody's attracted to anybody, you know,

742
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,620
 when they're in the second grade.

743
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,100
 Like right now, I've got little ones,

744
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,620
 and little girls, and boys just have cooties, you know?

745
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,220
 And so nobody's attracted to the opposite sex

746
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,500
 at a super early age.

747
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,100
 It happens at some point.

748
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,460
 But when we move through adolescence,

749
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,780
 our bodies begin to bond, and specifically for males,

750
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,660
 as we begin to experience the release

751
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,600
 of some sort of orgasm, our brain creates synapse

752
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,340
 that could bond us to the same sex,

753
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,740
 if that is what is more mysterious to us.

754
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,940
 Because before that, girls aren't beautiful,

755
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,540
 they're just kind of mysterious.

756
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,480
 And so our bodies begin to bond to something.

757
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,740
 I believe that's a great explanation for this.

758
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,500
 That comes from Ricky Shillette,

759
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,620
 who struggled much of his life with homosexuality himself.

760
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,460
 You can go for more information on that,

761
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,740
 go to livehope.org.

762
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,020
 I hope that you will, if you're here,

763
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,660
 and you identify as gay,

764
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,980
 or you struggle with homosexuality,

765
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,220
 that you would check out livehope.org,

766
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,060
 Ricky Shillette's ministry.

767
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,560
 Now for girls, it's different.

768
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,080
 For girls, it comes from an emotional attachment,

769
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,940
 almost always some sort of codependency,

770
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,580
 some sort of really close friendship,

771
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,020
 which crosses the line and turns physical.

772
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,260
 And when it turns physical, it's confusing,

773
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,980
 you're convinced that you're lesbian,

774
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,280
 or bisexual, or whatever that is,

775
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,340
 and you continue to act out.

776
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,420
 Very similar, almost always,

777
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,100
 in almost in every single case,

778
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,900
 the same sex parent is either absent,

779
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,700
 or neglected, or confused,

780
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,460
 or doesn't identify well with you.

781
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,260
 And so I believe that there is cases

782
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,540
 of both nature and nurture,

783
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,380
 that both of those are in play

784
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,840
 to cause someone to live out the homosexual lifestyle.

785
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,900
 I had a friend I sat with,

786
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,420
 I sit with people who identify as gay,

787
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,340
 or struggle with homosexuality often.

788
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,780
 And I had a friend, and I just said,

789
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,540
 "Hey, when did you notice that this was your deal?"

790
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,240
 And he said, "JP, when you're in the locker room,

791
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,380
 "you can't control how your body responds."

792
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,540
 And I was just hit with compassion by that.

793
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,020
 I was like, "What a great explanation.

794
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,460
 "When you're a dude in a locker room

795
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,760
 "with a bunch of naked dudes,

796
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,300
 "and your body responds, that's a..."

797
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,820
 I would certainly think,

798
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,620
 "Hey, this is my natural predisposition,

799
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,500
 "this is the way that God made me."

800
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,580
 And that's a feeling.

801
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:38,080
 But what you do with that feeling is up to you.

802
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,000
 That's the action that comes from that feeling.

803
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,140
 I don't deny the feeling, not for one second,

804
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,740
 I believe that it's real.

805
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,900
 But I believe with the feeling, you have a responsibility.

806
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,460
 I have lots of feelings,

807
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,940
 and I'm not even trying to relate to the gay community.

808
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,500
 I'm just saying I have lots of feelings

809
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,180
 that I have to take captive and not act out on.

810
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,160
 And so I will tell you that your identity, friends,

811
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
 is so much more than your sexual orientation.

812
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,980
 Your identity is so much more than your sexual orientation.

813
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,820
 Verse 11, this is where we get hope.

814
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:20,620
 "Idolaters, men who have sex with men,

815
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,520
 "the sexually immoral drunkards."

816
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,860
 And that is what some of you were.

817
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,180
 But you were washed, you were sanctified,

818
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,260
 and you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

819
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,940
 and by the Spirit of our God, He changed you.

820
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,780
 And so my third and final point

821
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,820
 is the change that is necessary.

822
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,220
 There are three kinds of changes

823
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,260
 that I believe are necessary.

824
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,180
 The first one is that Christians must change our approach.

825
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,060
 We must change our approach and point people to Jesus,

826
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,040
 and share Jesus with non-believers.

827
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,460
 Not try to make them not gay,

828
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,920
 but try to show them the hope that they have in the gospel,

829
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,180
 that with believers we would point them to the truth.

830
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,240
 And I know it is a very scary reality for some of you

831
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,100
 that you might be celibate the rest of your life.

832
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,340
 But I know also that there are a lot of women

833
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,140
 in the room right now that are faced

834
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,720
 with that same real reality, that same fear.

835
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,200
 And it's not godly.

836
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,640
 It's ungodly.

837
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,860
 You can trust Him, He has a plan for you.

838
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,820
 And you're not gonna get to the end of this race,

839
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,220
 and get up there and be like,

840
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,380
 "God, I was celibate, what's up with that?"

841
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,460
 You know, you're not gonna be like,

842
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,780
 "I missed out on sex."

843
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,580
 It's going to be okay.

844
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,540
 My buddy, the guy in the locker room,

845
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,300
 said, "I don't think I will ever be attracted to women.

846
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,980
 "But I love Jesus, and I understand the scriptures,

847
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,040
 "so I'm committed to celibacy.

848
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,020
 "I will never have sex.

849
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,020
 "I will die, and I won't know what that's like."

850
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:57,020
 That's okay, I have older, single female friends

851
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,620
 who'd say, "You know what, I may not have sex.

852
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,000
 "I may die, I may leave this earth, I may get to heaven,

853
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,140
 "having never had sex."

854
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,860
 It's going to be okay, we're all almost there anyways.

855
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,300
 Life is so short, man.

856
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:10,700
 And I know you're thinking, "Well, easy for you to say.

857
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,620
 "I get it, I understand."

858
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,460
 I'm just telling you, that's their testimony.

859
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,700
 We'll be in heaven soon.

860
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,980
 I have a hunch that you're gonna get up there,

861
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,820
 and he's gonna have a reward for you

862
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,100
 that's going to make it so worth it.

863
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,660
 It's gonna be so worth it, man.

864
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,620
 And even if you've given into that,

865
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,100
 Macklemore says this,

866
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,580
 and I can't change, in the chorus, she sings,

867
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,500
 "Even if I tried, even if I wanted to,

868
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,220
 "my love, she keeps me warm, she keeps me warm,

869
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,140
 "she keeps me warm, she keeps me warm."

870
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,160
 If you're here and you're attracted to the same sex,

871
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,780
 I want you to know Macklemore's right.

872
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,100
 You can't change.

873
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,980
 But my God, the creator of the heavens and the earth,

874
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,140
 is God of miracles.

875
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,380
 He can do anything.

876
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,780
 He can do anything, he can certainly change you.

877
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,220
 And that's the second thing, the change that's necessary.

878
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,780
 The people who struggle with homosexuality

879
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,020
 must understand that change is possible.

880
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,180
 I see this all the time, at least once a month.

881
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,820
 I had a friend who acted out all through college,

882
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,900
 was very much in the gay lifestyle,

883
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,820
 very much in multiple gay relationships,

884
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,300
 never thought that he would not be gay,

885
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,700
 went through a recovery ministry here,

886
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,220
 was told by many of his gay friends,

887
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,700
 "Hey, they're just trying to change you,

888
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,180
 "that's not loving, that's unloving."

889
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,700
 Married a girl on our staff,

890
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,980
 they have a little girl now named Hope,

891
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,140
 because he said, "There's hope."

892
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,500
 That's his message for you, there's hope.

893
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,020
 Have another friend who I prayed for long ago,

894
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,860
 it was actually a friend of mine's sister,

895
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
 we were in a Bible study together,

896
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
 he said, "Hey, pray for my sister,

897
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,100
 "she's in the same sex relationship."

898
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,380
 We prayed as a Bible study,

899
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,740
 I never heard anything else about it

900
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,660
 until I saw her name again as someone

901
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,260
 we were hiring on staff at Watermark.

902
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,100
 I went to her and I said, "I prayed for you years ago."

903
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,340
 She goes, "I'm married now."

904
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,540
 I said, "But you were in the same sex."

905
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,940
 She goes, "Yeah, I was.

906
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,860
 "I'm married now, she's today pregnant."

907
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,740
 God can change people for sure,

908
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,300
 but for you, he might not.

909
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,260
 Man, you may have this struggle for the rest of your life,

910
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,780
 you may continue to be attracted to the same sex

911
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,740
 for the rest of your life,

912
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,500
 that may absolutely be the reality that you live in.

913
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,220
 And I want you to know something,

914
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,780
 that when your identity is so wrapped up

915
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,980
 in your sexuality or your sexual orientation,

916
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,540
 someone asking you to change is absolutely offensive.

917
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,380
 It is confrontational.

918
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,660
 If your identity is your sexuality

919
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,540
 and someone's saying, "Hey, you need to change."

920
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,420
 You're like, "How can I change who I am?"

921
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,660
 But I want you to know

922
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,260
 that I'm not trying to make you not gay

923
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,780
 or even tell you that you're not gay.

924
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,780
 I'm trying to tell you that you are so much more than gay,

925
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,180
 that God loves you,

926
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,420
 that your identity is in Christ who died for you,

927
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,220
 and there's no shame in the kingdom.

928
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,540
 And you sit there and some of you,

929
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,220
 you're not out of the closet,

930
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,060
 and you're like, "There's things that have happened to me

931
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,980
 "in my life that I'm gonna take to the grave."

932
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
 And I know you're here,

933
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,580
 and I want you to know

934
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,940
 that there is no shame in the kingdom.

935
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,620
 All of those things were disastrously displayed on the cross

936
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,540
 for the world to see.

937
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,620
 They went on Jesus.

938
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,340
 Everything that happened in private

939
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,860
 went on him in the public square

940
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,460
 as he breathed his last breath for you.

941
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,860
 And change is possible.

942
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,220
 He died for it.

943
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,180
 In fact, following Christ means change.

944
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,460
 Sanctification means change, and we all want change.

945
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,180
 That's why we make New Year's resolutions.

946
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,060
 That's why self-help books are the best sellers

947
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,860
 year after year after year.

948
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,980
 Everybody wants change.

949
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,780
 The most despairing message in the world

950
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,020
 is you can't change.

951
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,580
 But God can change you.

952
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,020
 It's what he does.

953
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,660
 He's really, really good at it.

954
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,820
 And that is what some of you were,

955
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,020
 but you were washed, you were sanctified,

956
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,580
 you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

957
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,020
 by the spirit of our God.

958
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,300
 I was a sex addict, a pornographer,

959
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,860
 a pervert, I was a pervert.

960
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,700
 If you knew where my mind was,

961
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,460
 you wouldn't let me preach up here.

962
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,300
 But God washed me.

963
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,740
 He is sanctifying me.

964
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,700
 He justified me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

965
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
 and by the spirit of our God.

966
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,020
 And Macklemore says, "The right-wing conservatives

967
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,300
 "think it's a decision.

968
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,220
 "I don't think how you feel is a decision.

969
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,140
 "I think what you do with those feelings is a decision."

970
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:00,900
 I know men who feel attracted to eight-year-old boys.

971
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,620
 And I believe that feeling is absolutely real.

972
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,300
 But I would not tell them to act out on it

973
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,340
 because they feel it.

974
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,380
 I would tell them to take that thought captive

975
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,940
 and to conform it to the image and the character of Christ.

976
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,020
 And I know that we've made this a civil rights issue

977
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,180
 as of late, and I want you to know

978
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,620
 that race is not a feeling.

979
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,540
 I have felt African-American most of my life.

980
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,740
 (congregation laughing)

981
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,740
 And it doesn't, it doesn't make me black.

982
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,140
 (congregation laughing)

983
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,540
 Race is sacred.

984
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,740
 Race is determined by God.

985
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,140
 Sex is also sacred.

986
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,940
 He invented it.

987
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,620
 And so the Bible condemns racism.

988
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,580
 That's why at the center of most civil rights movements

989
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,460
 was Christians, people who knew the Bible.

990
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:57,500
 But I'm telling you that you choose who you have sex with.

991
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,020
 And if you have sex in a way that is different

992
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,700
 than God's design, it's wrong and it's harmful.

993
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,940
 And I haven't spent any time talking about God's design

994
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,220
 because I think it's pretty obvious,

995
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,940
 but you can imagine God made Adam.

996
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,580
 He looked down and said, "What's that?

997
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,660
 "And what's it for?"

998
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,700
 And then God made woman.

999
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,660
 And he said, "Oh, that's what that's for."

1000
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,820
 (congregation laughing)

1001
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,180
 And I know it's kind of funny,

1002
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,540
 but I just wanna go logical with you for a second,

1003
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,540
 that her body changes and moves and accommodates that

1004
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:35,340
 in a way that brings forth life.

1005
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,860
 This is God's incredible design.

1006
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,500
 It is beautiful and fascinating.

1007
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,660
 But if you do with that instrument other things,

1008
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,180
 you bring harm to your life.

1009
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,180
 And that is why a God who loves you says, "Don't.

1010
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:54,740
 "Even if you feel like it, don't, because I love you."

1011
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,860
 And I know it's a hot topic for government

1012
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
 and I won't spend a lot of time here,

1013
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,100
 but I would tell you that a government

1014
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,020
 should always govern us toward what is best for society.

1015
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,500
 And so if you are pro-redefining marriage,

1016
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
 then you believe that what is best for society

1017
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,580
 is for a child to have two mommies or two daddies.

1018
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
 If you believe that,

1019
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,620
 you're certainly entitled to that belief.

1020
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:25,500
 But there's another change that needs to happen.

1021
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,300
 It's a change in our society, that's the third one.

1022
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,260
 Because Paul writes that this particular struggle

1023
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,220
 is a sign of God's judgment on mankind.

1024
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:41,540
 That it is evidence that we do what we feel like,

1025
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,180
 regardless of what he says.

1026
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,460
 Romans 1, verse 25 to 27 says,

1027
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,020
 "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie

1028
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,100
 "and worshiped and served created things

1029
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,020
 "rather than the creator who is forever praised, amen."

1030
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,540
 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie.

1031
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,420
 That which God says is wrong, they said, "It's not wrong."

1032
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,100
 They took a truth and they said,

1033
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,940
 "Hey, here's a lie and we'll hold onto that."

1034
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,300
 God says, "Hey, this is wrong."

1035
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,260
 They said, "Now it's not wrong."

1036
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,100
 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.

1037
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,260
 Even their women exchanged natural relations

1038
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,420
 for unnatural ones.

1039
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,060
 In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations

1040
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,980
 with women and were inflamed with lust for one another.

1041
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,500
 Men committed shameful acts with other men

1042
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,420
 and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

1043
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:30,900
 And I want you to know there's no shame in the kingdom

1044
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,740
 that God forgives.

1045
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,540
 He says, "I've removed your transgressions

1046
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,140
 "as far as the east is from the west,

1047
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,220
 "an impossible distance.

1048
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,220
 "I have covered them with the very blood of my son, Jesus,

1049
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,380
 "because I love you."

1050
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,620
 It's interesting that we are,

1051
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,820
 our culture's really heating up on this topic

1052
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,660
 and we're like a frog in water being boiled

1053
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,820
 and not fully aware.

1054
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,380
 When I first heard the song, "Same Love," she says,

1055
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,940
 "It's a woman saying, 'She keeps me warm, she keeps me warm.'"

1056
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,780
 And that was weird to me.

1057
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,620
 It was interesting to me.

1058
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,900
 That woman was saying, "She keeps me warm."

1059
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,380
 And it was like, wow, that just doesn't sit right with me.

1060
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,900
 But Macklemore's been incredibly successful

1061
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,820
 because when I hear it today, it's not weird.

1062
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,660
 I've been conditioned.

1063
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:18,380
 I'm like, oh, there's nothing weird about that.

1064
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,620
 That's totally normal.

1065
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,060
 That's completely right and I don't think anything of it.

1066
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,580
 And I want you to know something, friends.

1067
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,420
 I'm not a bigot.

1068
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,500
 I've never hated someone because they were gay.

1069
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,220
 More often, I feel hated because I call it a sin,

1070
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,780
 just like my sin.

1071
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,140
 I feel like Macklemore hates me, if I'm honest.

1072
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,940
 And if you're here and you've been given over to that sin,

1073
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,100
 I want you to know that God loves you

1074
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,300
 and He's not mad at you.

1075
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,780
 And I believe that in your heart,

1076
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,260
 you know that it's not right, that it's unnatural,

1077
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,700
 even though it feels natural to you.

1078
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,780
 If you're here and you struggle well,

1079
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,020
 I want you to know I'm so proud of you.

1080
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,260
 I have a feeling that the Lord has something

1081
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,820
 really special stored up for you

1082
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,820
 that's available to all of you,

1083
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,180
 special for all of you.

1084
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,140
 And if you're here and you're a heterosexual Christian,

1085
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,180
 I want to ask you, how have you loved on the gay community?

1086
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,300
 Not just hated the sin,

1087
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,340
 but how have you loved the sinner around you?

1088
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,660
 How have you gone to lunch and brought down the fence

1089
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,020
 and said, hey, I want to enter into your world?

1090
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,300
 I'm gonna end tonight by inviting up my friend,

1091
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,540
 John Burnie, who is just going to share

1092
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,860
 for a moment with you his story.

1093
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,940
 If you would, welcome John to the stage.

1094
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,380
 (congregation applauding)

1095
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:51,380
 - Like I said, my name is John Burnie

1096
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,580
 and the PORCH team asked me to share a little bit

1097
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,700
 of my story this evening.

1098
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,220
 And I knew that if I didn't write it down,

1099
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,900
 I'd be so nervous to share it.

1100
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,980
 I was so nervous this year that I'd forget my name.

1101
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,220
 So bear with me.

1102
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,260
 One of my very first memories growing up

1103
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,460
 is standing against a brick wall

1104
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,820
 and an older neighborhood boy lining two of us up

1105
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:14,300
 to be chosen for a sexual encounter

1106
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,340
 and not being the one chosen.

1107
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,980
 Later on, he would go on to abuse me.

1108
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,500
 But some of the deepest hurt that came from that encounter

1109
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,700
 was that it introduced a lie that I was not chosen.

1110
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,380
 I remember feeling shame not only for the act,

1111
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,500
 but also for desiring it and desiring to be chosen.

1112
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,580
 I started to have homosexual fantasies shortly after that,

1113
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,540
 starting about the age of six,

1114
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,340
 and really remember lying about those thoughts

1115
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,220
 from that age on.

1116
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,740
 In junior high, I started to physically lust

1117
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,540
 over the male physique and seek out pornography,

1118
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,120
 which continued to grow through high school.

1119
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,380
 By the end of high school,

1120
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,580
 I remember coming to the realization

1121
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,260
 that these desires were not something

1122
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,940
 I was just going to outgrow.

1123
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,200
 They were following me.

1124
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,900
 In college, I acted out physically

1125
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,000
 and felt guilt, shame, and alone, completely isolated.

1126
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,620
 I felt that if I told the truth,

1127
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,060
 my whole world would crumble.

1128
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,660
 After college, I moved to Dallas,

1129
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,660
 and our family had some turmoil

1130
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,420
 that uncovered some family secrets.

1131
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,300
 It was at this point in my life that I remember thinking,

1132
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,660
 oh, I can go through my whole life

1133
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,900
 and never tell the truth,

1134
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,140
 and even still, at some point,

1135
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,020
 it's going to be revealed and it's going to be hurtful.

1136
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,100
 So I decided to go to regeneration

1137
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,580
 and Watermarks Recovery Program

1138
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,860
 in hope of telling the truth.

1139
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,460
 To be honest, three years ago,

1140
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,260
 when I started regeneration,

1141
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,220
 I could not even say what I am sharing with you today

1142
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,620
 by myself in front of a mirror.

1143
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,820
 My life was ruled by fear,

1144
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,300
 and now, three years later, by the grace of God,

1145
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,820
 I am here with the opportunity

1146
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,360
 to share God's story in my life.

1147
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,980
 I think that a big shift in thinking for me

1148
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:55,100
 is knowing that my testimony is not about what I've done,

1149
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,260
 but about what Christ has done for me,

1150
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,860
 and through this, I have a new life.

1151
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,300
 I'm not sharing my story,

1152
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,940
 but the grace of God at work in my own life.

1153
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,100
 2 Corinthians 5:17 says,

1154
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,340
 "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

1155
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,820
 "The old is passed away; behold, the new is come."

1156
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,140
 At regeneration, I was introduced to that verse,

1157
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,460
 which is a promise that the things I struggle with

1158
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,140
 don't define who I am.

1159
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,180
 It is Christ who defines who I am.

1160
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,900
 How does that look for me today?

1161
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,340
 It's not that I'm perfect or don't struggle,

1162
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,620
 or that lust isn't something that isn't there,

1163
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,820
 but really living life,

1164
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,500
 trusting that God is making me new, like his word promises.

1165
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,040
 Romans 12, one and two says,

1166
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,080
 "Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy,

1167
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,140
 "to offer your bodies as living sacrifices,

1168
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,880
 "holy and pleasing to God.

1169
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,040
 "This is your spiritual act of worship.

1170
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,020
 "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,

1171
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,700
 "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

1172
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,380
 "Then you will be able to test and approve

1173
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,800
 "what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will."

1174
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,740
 I am learning that the renewing of my mind

1175
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,460
 is only brought about by a daily,

1176
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,640
 abiding relationship with God,

1177
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,980
 asking him to renew my mind.

1178
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,100
 Community and surrounding myself with other men

1179
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,160
 who are pursuing Christ, who know who I am,

1180
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,780
 and know what I struggle with, has been huge.

1181
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,380
 We share each other's burdens and hold each other accountable

1182
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,260
 and I've seen fruit from it,

1183
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,880
 like being able to share my testimony with my little sister

1184
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,120
 and say this in front of you all.

1185
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,960
 These are things that were unimaginable to me.

1186
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,860
 I thought I always would have to hide.

1187
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,140
 It is only by the grace of God that I can say today

1188
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:38,300
 that I am fully known and I am not rejected, but accepted.

1189
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,780
 I have been shown mercy and love.

1190
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,620
 Thanks.

1191
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,780
 (audience applauding)

1192
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,780
 (audience cheering)

1193
00:51:47,780 --> 00:52:10,740
 - I don't know what it's like to sit there for an hour

1194
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,740
 while someone is talking about your struggle.

1195
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,500
 When you don't see it as a struggle,

1196
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,460
 maybe you see it as a gift, I don't know what it's like.

1197
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,900
 But I know where life is found and I found life myself

1198
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,580
 in the same place where John has found life.

1199
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,540
 If you're here and you identify as gay, I love you.

1200
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,780
 God loves you even more than I do or could.

1201
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,100
 He has an amazing life for you.

1202
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,460
 He has a kingdom stored up for you

1203
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,460
 and the battle will be hard, the battle will be real.

1204
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,300
 The struggle will be difficult.

1205
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,220
 I've seen people jump on the road and jump off the road

1206
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,620
 and jump back on the road and it's a very similar path

1207
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,120
 that I have ventured down myself with pornography.

1208
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,380
 But I know where life is found.

1209
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,560
 So whether you're in Dallas or Fort Worth

1210
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,500
 or listening in around the country,

1211
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,980
 I want you to know that God is crazy about you.

1212
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:17,500
 He's shown that through displaying the gospel.

1213
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,340
 His son, Jesus Christ, your sin going on him,

1214
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,560
 him going in the grave, him coming out of the grave,

1215
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,480
 promising you that you can live forever with God.

1216
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,860
 That is the hope that we have.

1217
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,340
 I pray that you have it in common.

1218
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,340
 When you trust in that, he deposits his spirit in you

1219
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:36,460
 as a helper to sanctify you and what that spirit does

1220
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,140
 in the lives of all of us is he changes us.

1221
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:45,060
 He makes us, he takes us from being dead to life.

1222
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,380
 And I have heard stories like John's over and over

1223
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,140
 and over and over and over again

1224
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,440
 and I will never get tired of hearing them,

1225
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,260
 both in girls' lives, in men's life,

1226
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,400
 in several of your lives.

1227
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,740
 And I'm grateful for that message of change.

1228
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,980
 We can't change.

1229
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,820
 But he changes us.

1230
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,660
 Let me pray.

1231
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:19,500
 Father, help us as the church to be full of grace and truth.

1232
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,340
 Father, in your supernatural abilities,

1233
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,220
 will you take those who feel shame right now

1234
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,460
 and will you remind them that you love them?

1235
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,700
 Will you remind them that your grace is sufficient,

1236
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,500
 that your power is made perfect in our weakness?

1237
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,660
 And Father, will you equip your church,

1238
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,620
 your bride, the church, to love those in our paths

1239
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:48,140
 and to call the church to truth

1240
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,740
 and those outside the church to the gospel?

1241
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,340
 Thank you for the gospel, Lord.

1242
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,360
 Thank you for how you love us.

1243
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,720
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1244
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:03,440
 I had a friend just tell me like,

1245
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,340
 she's like, "I get it, man.

1246
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,180
 "I was raised in the church.

1247
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,080
 "I know it's a sin.

1248
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,220
 "I don't know that you need to cover that."

1249
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,500
 And I don't think you get it.

1250
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,700
 Everyone has something to do when they leave here.

1251
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,220
 We all are responsible for bringing down this fence.

1252
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,580
 We all must move toward someone in our lives

1253
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,620
 to show them and display God's love,

1254
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,240
 not to make them not gay,

1255
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,140
 but to tell them that they've been made new

1256
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,260
 through Jesus Christ.

1257
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,260
 Oh, how he loves you.

1258
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,620
 Some of you need to hear that desperately right now.

1259
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,660
 God is crazy about you.

1260
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,060
 He's not mad at you for what you did last night,

1261
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,860
 for there's now no condemnation for those who are in Christ

1262
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,540
 and he's no longer counting your sins against you

1263
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,060
 if you've trusted in Christ.

1264
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,000
 And some of you,

1265
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,020
 some of you need to feel the weight of that condemnation

1266
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,540
 so that you might move to a place

1267
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,460
 where there's not any in Christ,

1268
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,500
 that you would trust that 2014 years ago,

1269
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,780
 God loved you so much that he sent his son to this earth

1270
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,900
 to live a perfect life and to die a perfect death

1271
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,480
 specifically and especially for you.

1272
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,540
 In a moment, if you're here

1273
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,820
 and you're looking for community,

1274
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,580
 there's gonna be guys that gather in this room

1275
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,980
 right down this hallway that would love to talk with you.

1276
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,140
 And if you're a girl, there's girls in this hallway

1277
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,380
 that would love to talk with you.

1278
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,500
 They're also looking for other Christians

1279
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,820
 to go through life with.

1280
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,780
 There's gonna be a lot of people up here

1281
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,060
 that would love to pray for you if you're here

1282
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,940
 and your struggle is homosexuality

1283
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,940
 or you identify as gay, I'd love to meet you.

1284
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,220
 And also, if you just wanna come up,

1285
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,100
 I don't want people to feel like that's the only reason

1286
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,940
 that you have to come up here.

1287
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,340
 If we can pray for you about anything,

1288
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,560
 whatever's going on in your life,

1289
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,660
 maybe something else resonated with you.

1290
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,900
 If you have more questions

1291
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,780
 or wanna talk about other topics

1292
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,700
 that we didn't cover tonight in regards to this,

1293
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,340
 we would love to talk with you also.

1294
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,620
 And I'll keep my commitment that I made to you

1295
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,940
 on the front end.

1296
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,620
 I'd love to meet with you.

1297
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,700
 I love you guys.

1298
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,700
 Go in peace, to love and serve the Lord.

1299
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,860
 (silence)

1300
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:19,860
