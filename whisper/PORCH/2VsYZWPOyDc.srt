1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:23,760
 - Porch, how we doing?

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,400
 We doing okay?

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,560
 Hey, it's great to see you.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,540
 Thanks for making the time to be with us this evening.

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,260
 So glad that you would be here.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,540
 I'm really excited for tonight.

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,380
 I don't know about you.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,200
 I don't know how you're feeling tonight.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,980
 I am personally very excited.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,600
 Number one, we got some fall weather rolling in,

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 which is praiseworthy, right?

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,440
 Can I get an amen?

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,260
 That's a good thing.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,180
 Yeah, I love that.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,300
 Really excited that you're here tonight.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,980
 I don't just say that, I actually mean that truly.

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,540
 I do not take it for granted that you would be

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,860
 in this room with us every single Tuesday.

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,900
 Part of me always wonders,

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,140
 God, are they gonna come back?

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,500
 And yet you keep due.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,620
 And so we're gonna keep showing up.

24
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,860
 And I think God's got good things in store.

25
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,380
 We also really excited because we've got young adults

26
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,300
 from all over the nation tuning in tonight.

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,580
 Everybody give it up for Porch Live.

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,060
 Yes, give it up for them.

29
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,740
 Love what God's doing around the globe.

30
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,380
 It's so cool that we get to be a part

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,620
 of what he's doing in your life.

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,900
 We truly mean it, that we believe God can be

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,460
 with any person anywhere and at any time.

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,660
 And that includes those of you that are tuning in.

35
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,520
 Special shout out to Porch Live Fresno, Boise, and Dayton.

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,540
 So glad you're here.

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,140
 And then also we've got some very special friends

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,060
 that are tuning in with us from Alaska.

39
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,960
 So we're really glad y'all are on too.

40
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,740
 And then last thing that I'm really excited about

41
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,180
 is the person you're gonna get to hear from tonight.

42
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,580
 We're taking a brief pause in our series Disciple

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,420
 because we wanted to introduce to you someone

44
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,500
 that we're really excited to tell you about.

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,340
 As you've heard me say from this stage before,

46
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,900
 something that I feel a personal passion for

47
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,420
 as a young adult ministering to young adults

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,580
 is finding the next generation of communicators,

49
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,340
 people that I think we should be learning

50
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,020
 and listening from.

51
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,780
 And so I'm excited because tonight I get to introduce

52
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,460
 to you someone that I think fits that bill

53
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,660
 really, really well.

54
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,140
 Someone that I think is a trusted voice

55
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,140
 on any platform she stands on and is also a trusted voice

56
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,740
 in my own personal life as I've just gotten

57
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,420
 to observe her from afar and then do ministry

58
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,500
 alongside her in different capacities

59
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,860
 and learn from her myself.

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,060
 So I'm really excited to introduce to you

61
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,140
 a good friend of mine.

62
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,140
 And so Porch, I need you to do an exceptional job,

63
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,100
 like the best job.

64
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,380
 She's from Portland.

65
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,060
 You gotta give her a big Texas welcome

66
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,540
 when she comes to the stage.

67
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,540
 Would y'all give it up for my good friend Brenna Blain.

68
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,700
 [audience applauding]

69
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,700
 [audience cheering]

70
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:01,220
 This is my third time in Texas.

71
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,300
 And something about me, yeah, that's a good thing.

72
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,860
 Something about me is that when I get really excited

73
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,860
 about something, I tend to assimilate to the culture

74
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,420
 a little bit much.

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,140
 And so the last time I was in Dallas,

76
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,380
 I went to Tyler Kingston Mercantile

77
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,020
 and bought out almost the entire store.

78
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,900
 I got this shirt that said Texas on it.

79
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,580
 I got a bandana.

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,220
 And for the next six months, I would wear cutoff jeans.

81
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,660
 I'd wear my Texas shirt and my bandana

82
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,060
 when I would go preach places.

83
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,180
 And it started to happen that people would be like,

84
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,180
 oh, Texas shirt, are you from Texas?

85
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,540
 And I'd go, well, not technically.

86
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,660
 'Cause I was just so in love.

87
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,660
 And I think I come by this enthusiastic love

88
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,900
 and adoption of adoration for places

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,380
 because something about my mom,

90
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,180
 I think that my siblings would also agree with

91
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,580
 is that if there's something that she loves,

92
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,340
 not only does she go all in on it,

93
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,420
 but she wants us to love it too.

94
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,420
 And I think that's maybe how me and all my siblings

95
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,300
 ended up in musical theater.

96
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,720
 But, oh, okay, musical theater, yeah.

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,580
 But my mom would sometimes try to convince us

98
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,420
 that we loved the same things she did

99
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,920
 in ways that I think she thought were incredibly subtle,

100
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,940
 but that really were not.

101
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,540
 I remember my mom had this fictional author

102
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,580
 that she just loved.

103
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,340
 And I would walk into my mom's room at night

104
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,460
 and she'd be laying in bed with just tears

105
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,180
 streaming down her face.

106
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,700
 And I'd be like, mom, what's wrong?

107
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,060
 And she'd be like, it's this book.

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,740
 And I'm like, what the heck?

109
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,900
 And one of the books that my mom read,

110
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,420
 I think she read it several times.

111
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,620
 When I got a little bit older, she started to say,

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,300
 hey, Brenna, I think you'd really love this book.

113
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,220
 And I'd say, no.

114
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,680
 And then go to bed.

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,580
 And I'd be sleeping and I'd wake up

116
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,300
 and I'd have this pain in my back.

117
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
 And I'd be like, what the heck is that?

118
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,100
 And I found the book in my bed one night.

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,300
 My mom snuck it into my bed.

120
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,980
 And I didn't think much about this book.

121
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,040
 It was some Christian romance type book.

122
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,100
 And I remember my mom would say,

123
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,660
 it's based off the book of Hosea.

124
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,540
 And I thought, yeah, never read it.

125
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,580
 And somehow I escaped not only four years

126
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,300
 of not reading that book,

127
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,000
 but also four years of high school,

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,080
 not really even reading the Bible.

129
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,960
 And certainly not the prophets,

130
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,840
 because I had this perception that one,

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,140
 they were incredibly boring.

132
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,140
 And two, they had nothing to offer me.

133
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,140
 And then the book of Hosea completely changed my life.

134
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,040
 So let's read today.

135
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
 When the Lord began to speak through Hosea,

136
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,880
 the Lord said to him, go, marry a promiscuous woman

137
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,360
 and have children with her.

138
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,320
 For like an adulterous wife,

139
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,860
 this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord.

140
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,760
 So he married Gomer, daughter of Dibliam,

141
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,320
 and she conceived and bore him a son.

142
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,280
 Then skipping to Hosea three, it says,

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,760
 and the Lord said to me, go again,

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,480
 love a woman who is loved by another man

145
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,240
 and is an adulteress.

146
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,040
 Even as the Lord loves the children of Israel,

147
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,060
 though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins.

148
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,940
 So I bought her for 15 shekels of silver

149
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,000
 and a homer and a lecheth of barley.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,440
 And I said to her, you must dwell as mine for many days.

151
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,560
 You shall not play the whore or belong to another man.

152
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,880
 So will I also be to you.

153
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,660
 For the children of Israel shall dwell many days

154
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,620
 without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar,

155
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,600
 without ephod or household gods.

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,480
 After the children of Israel shall return

157
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,440
 and seek the Lord their God and David their king,

158
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,480
 and they shall come in fear to the Lord

159
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,600
 and his goodness in the later days.

160
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 So for context, the book of Hosea is an interesting one

161
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,760
 because there is so much meaning

162
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,860
 packed into just six and a half pages

163
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,580
 that make up the book in our modern Bibles.

164
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,420
 But with all things in the word,

165
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,260
 it is important that we look at it

166
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,540
 with the understanding that all of it matters.

167
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,020
 All of it matters.

168
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,240
 Every single paragraph down to the words

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,140
 that were God breathed and not just written

170
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,540
 to the people living in that specific time period,

171
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,980
 but were also given for us.

172
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,080
 Another thing that makes Hosea interesting

173
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,420
 is that there is not just an abundance of poetic forms

174
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,340
 like many of the prophets we see in the Bible,

175
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,500
 but it holds a narrative about Hosea himself

176
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,080
 that is intertwined within the pages

177
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,480
 of his prophecy to Israel.

178
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,680
 You see, God did not just say to Hosea,

179
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,680
 here's your calling, I'm going to use your words,

180
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,100
 but he said, here's your calling,

181
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,260
 and I'm going to use your life.

182
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,140
 You guys have been focusing on a topic of discipleship,

183
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,160
 the submission of your lives

184
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,400
 to the creator God of the universe

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,920
 because you see and know that he is trustworthy.

186
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,980
 But the reality is that some of you are here

187
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,340
 and you don't buy that.

188
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,140
 Maybe a friend has been dragging you along

189
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,760
 or maybe you're here because some feeling

190
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,260
 has been nagging you because you grew up in the Bible belt

191
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,060
 and this is just what good people do.

192
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,560
 And so either out of shame or guilt

193
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,380
 or strange obligation, you are here.

194
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,080
 But if you had it your way, you would be someplace else.

195
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,980
 Or maybe you're here as someone who shouldn't be.

196
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,620
 You got the courage to walk through the doors

197
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,040
 and you think to yourself,

198
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,940
 if anyone knew what my actual life was like,

199
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,540
 I would be unwelcomed.

200
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,700
 If anyone knew that I'm actually a sex worker,

201
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,240
 if anyone knew, sure, I'm involved with serving,

202
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,980
 but I blow all my money on OnlyFans.

203
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,620
 If anyone knew that I'm actually transgender,

204
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,740
 if anyone actually knew the hatred I feel

205
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,960
 for certain groups of people.

206
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,900
 And so you hear the scripture being read

207
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,100
 and you zone out

208
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,500
 because it's not interesting or relevant to you.

209
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,460
 Or you read Hosea and there is an ache in your heart

210
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,340
 because you don't identify with Hosea.

211
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,080
 You don't identify with God.

212
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,800
 You don't look at these faithful leaders

213
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,960
 and see yourself.

214
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,860
 Instead, you see the unfaithfulness and the brokenness

215
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,660
 and the humanity of your life.

216
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,880
 And you say, that's me.

217
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,960
 I'm too far gone.

218
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,800
 I'm too disobedient.

219
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 I'm too uninterested in Jesus

220
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,340
 to even have a space at the table.

221
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,600
 And even just being here in this room today

222
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,120
 is starting to feel uncomfortable to you.

223
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,720
 And you're just trying to honor whoever invited you

224
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,060
 or the curiosity that brought you through those doors.

225
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,800
 But I believe, and I've been tuning in the last few weeks

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,380
 and just watching and listening and praying.

227
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,040
 I believe God is doing something in this space.

228
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,720
 And we have to press into what that is.

229
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,960
 Because the reality is, if you don't care,

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,420
 if your heart is running,

231
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,300
 if you are uninterested in this entire night,

232
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,220
 it's not going to mean anything to you.

233
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,980
 But before we let that happen,

234
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,060
 I believe God is wanting to say,

235
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,140
 awake, oh sleeper,

236
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,760
 I have something for you.

237
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,640
 I don't know what that is.

238
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,780
 It's not a secret, but I am not wildly prophetic.

239
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,860
 So you will have to lean into what the Holy Spirit

240
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,180
 is doing in your heart tonight.

241
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:23,720
 But as you hear these words, as you hear scripture,

242
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,080
 I'll just want to say to you now,

243
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,120
 pay attention to what you feel

244
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,800
 the Holy Spirit is doing in your heart.

245
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,160
 Because what are the odds?

246
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,880
 What are the odds that you're feeling something

247
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,240
 just now, subtly stirring,

248
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,020
 and maybe I said something out loud

249
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,220
 that identified you in a church building

250
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,260
 for the first time in your entire life.

251
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,320
 And you're trying to figure out how to leave.

252
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,520
 Or you're trying to figure out

253
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,460
 if I'm going to close my computer and walk away.

254
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,400
 Don't.

255
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,600
 First, before you leave,

256
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,960
 can I just tell you about a time

257
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
 that I desperately wanted to leave?

258
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,940
 I had grown up in the Christian church,

259
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,600
 but after being abused at a young age,

260
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
 I really started to wrestle with things

261
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,080
 that felt unsafe for Christians to wrestle with.

262
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,560
 I was depressed and suicidal

263
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,820
 by the time I was a freshman in high school,

264
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,520
 while also wrestling with my sexuality.

265
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,320
 And I lived life often looking over my shoulder

266
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,820
 as if to say, "God, are you even there?

267
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,960
 "Do you even see me, or is all of this

268
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,140
 "that I've experienced just made up?"

269
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,600
 And I was nervous to tell my parents

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,820
 that I had deep doubt.

271
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,440
 So I never wanted to say, "I don't want to go to church,"

272
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,680
 but I think my parents knew I was wrestling with a lot.

273
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,100
 And so at the end of eighth grade, they said,

274
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,660
 "Hey, we would like for you to be in church,

275
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,780
 "but it doesn't have to be our church.

276
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,200
 "So if you just find a place,

277
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,840
 "we'd love for you to go there."

278
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,080
 And somehow I found a youth group

279
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,920
 that was like the dream for me.

280
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,520
 No one there talked about sports.

281
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,600
 Sorry, Texas.

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
 Almost everyone there listened to alternative music,

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,440
 and someone knew that I could play a few instruments.

284
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,260
 And so not even after one week of going,

285
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,560
 I got asked to join the worship team.

286
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,840
 And even though singing songs to a God

287
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,080
 I wasn't sure was even there felt odd,

288
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,160
 it was so much better to me

289
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,600
 that I had something to do during worship

290
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
 that I got to focus on playing an instrument

291
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,960
 than have to sit through and actually think

292
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,280
 and contemplate what worship even was.

293
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,440
 Because worship had this overwhelming effect on me.

294
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,920
 When I would have to sit there,

295
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,960
 I would see these people around me

296
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,480
 singing words of adoration and affection

297
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,360
 and praise to a God who had let me be abused,

298
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,400
 who had let me get to the place

299
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,140
 where I no longer wanted to live.

300
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,120
 And it was like everyone around me was in on something,

301
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,900
 was experiencing a God I never knew without me.

302
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,820
 And I would just want to scream.

303
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,600
 And that continued for all four years

304
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,800
 of my time in high school.

305
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,160
 And I had moments where I'd say to God,

306
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,680
 "Okay, maybe you are real.

307
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,240
 "Maybe you do care.

308
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,080
 "So I'm going to give you this.

309
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,180
 "This square inch of my life, you're welcome.

310
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,080
 "But you can't have any of this."

311
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,720
 And I would gather it all up in my arms,

312
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
 my depression, my anger, my self-image, my doubt,

313
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,520
 and I would run to every other thing this world

314
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,600
 and would say, "Do you think you could heal me?

315
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,040
 "Do you think you could make me better?"

316
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,240
 So by the time I was 18,

317
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 I had a lot of practice avoiding God.

318
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,520
 And I was at the age where I needed to decide

319
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,860
 what I was going to do next after graduation.

320
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,080
 So I did what any other person running from God would do.

321
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,820
 And I decided I would become a missionary.

322
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,680
 And I thought I was being clever.

323
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,960
 Like, "God, I'm going to hide from you

324
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,400
 "right under your nose and you will never find me."

325
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,720
 But you see, the truth was I hated school

326
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,000
 and I did not want to go to college, but I loved Hawaii.

327
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,680
 I wanted to smoke weed, date hot women, and surf.

328
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,020
 So I signed up to do six months with a missions group

329
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,800
 with the expectation that everyone else there

330
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,120
 would be just like me,

331
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,680
 not really bought into this idea of God

332
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,600
 wanting to do some traveling and just get away.

333
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,460
 And a lot of people there were just like me.

334
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,640
 I don't know if we all collectively thought

335
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,640
 we were tricking our parents or our youth pastors or what,

336
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,740
 but at least a handful of us thought we ran so far

337
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,360
 and so fast from God that he would never catch up.

338
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,400
 So the third morning, I am there,

339
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,380
 and we're still in this like preliminary free time zone

340
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,720
 where you could kind of do whatever you wanted to do

341
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,320
 the first few days.

342
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,440
 And I just wanted to be at the beach,

343
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,040
 but I had no car and hitchhiking out of town was difficult.

344
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,680
 And so when they announced that they were going to take

345
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,020
 some vans into town for the morning for worship,

346
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,440
 I thought, that's it.

347
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,320
 I got a ride.

348
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
 I'll just BS my way through this worship time.

349
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,520
 So at least I seem respectful and then I'll hit the beach.

350
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,940
 So we get to this place where we're going to have worship

351
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,960
 and I book it to the back of the room.

352
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,300
 And I'm like, this is going to be so weird.

353
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,660
 I'll just close my eyes and be back here

354
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,000
 and I'll get through it and I'll leave.

355
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 And I had grown up not really knowing the Holy Spirit.

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,440
 And I thought this missions group was like Baptist,

357
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,020
 but it wasn't.

358
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,040
 So my eyes are closed and we're singing some song

359
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,000
 that everyone knows because it was written in 2007.

360
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,060
 And I know music well because I'd been on worship team

361
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,360
 at that point for seven years.

362
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,280
 And I know there's an instrumental break coming up.

363
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,420
 So I'm sitting there and all of a sudden

364
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,420
 the instrumental goes, but then people are still singing.

365
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,840
 And I'm like, what the heck, who's taking a solo?

366
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,880
 And then more voices started to sing.

367
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,700
 And then some people started talking

368
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,460
 and I'm thinking, what the heck is happening?

369
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,660
 And my eyes are still closed,

370
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,620
 but now I'm bothered by what's happening

371
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,380
 because it just seems disrespectful.

372
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,940
 And you know how I shared about sitting in worship

373
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,020
 and just hating it in high school,

374
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,580
 but I opened my eyes and I see something

375
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,660
 I had never seen before in my life.

376
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,420
 I see this girl standing there like this,

377
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:20,460
 just singing her own song, her own words, just worshiping.

378
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,620
 And then I start to look around the room

379
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,620
 and I see people praying for people out loud.

380
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,940
 And I'm thinking, this is weird.

381
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,020
 And then the girl who's standing over here like this,

382
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,700
 she goes, yes Lord.

383
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:49,440
 And I don't know how or what it was,

384
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,060
 but I remember how every time I had to sit through worship,

385
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,700
 I just wanted to scream.

386
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,940
 And now here's this girl embodying all these negative things

387
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,780
 that had been pent up inside of me,

388
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,780
 but in a positive way in her worship and I lost it.

389
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:18,060
 I had never seen someone worship

390
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,920
 with their entire being before.

391
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,060
 And in that moment, I prayed a prayer

392
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,580
 I wasn't sure God would even hear.

393
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,780
 I said, God, if you are real,

394
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:42,620
 if you care for me, if you see me,

395
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,700
 I want you to let me know whatever it takes,

396
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,780
 because this is the most real thing

397
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,980
 I have ever seen in my life.

398
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,980
 And if there's a chance that my angst

399
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,420
 and my anxiety and my anguish could be set aside

400
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,060
 and I could know you like that,

401
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,340
 I want you to do whatever it takes to get me to that place.

402
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,700
 And I think the unsaved person in me says,

403
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,620
 no, you shouldn't have prayed that prayer.

404
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,260
 For the next entire month of being in this environment,

405
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,580
 it's like I'm watching a movie unfold.

406
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,300
 There were 32 students in my school.

407
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,860
 So 31, not including myself.

408
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,260
 And it was like every single day,

409
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,740
 someone else who was living a life much like mine,

410
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,300
 suspicious of God at best, just completely melted.

411
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:55,100
 I don't know what it was or why it was happening,

412
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,220
 but these people who looked like different versions of me

413
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,220
 were starting to confess, I am in love with God.

414
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,140
 And I was living with these people.

415
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,020
 So it wasn't just their words that were changing,

416
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,980
 it was their lives, their personalities, their character,

417
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,220
 the way that they interacted with people.

418
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,140
 They were really truly being changed by God.

419
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,340
 And during that entire month,

420
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,820
 I went through almost every prayer

421
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,940
 and worship session like this.

422
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,740
 And the more this happened for other people,

423
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,620
 and the more I saw people change,

424
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,940
 the more conversations I had with myself that said, no,

425
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,380
 this isn't gonna happen for me.

426
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,020
 I don't know what they're on, but I don't buy it.

427
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,860
 But I had a problem

428
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,300
 because we were supposed to do Christian things,

429
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,220
 because we were missionaries.

430
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,540
 And one of the things we had to do

431
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,060
 was prepare and preach a 10 minute chapel talk.

432
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,180
 And I signed up for the very last date possible

433
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,260
 on the calendar because I didn't want to do it.

434
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,420
 And by the end of the month,

435
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,260
 I had just a few days left until I was supposed to teach

436
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
 and I couldn't think of anything.

437
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,980
 I tried doing that thing where you sit there

438
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,340
 with your Bible and you open to a random page.

439
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,820
 And I was like, okay, God,

440
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,460
 whatever you want me to speak on, show me now.

441
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,860
 And every time, every time I opened it, it was Leviticus.

442
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,140
 And I was like, I can't do that.

443
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:46,940
 And then one day, something reminded me of that book.

444
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,260
 That my mom was always trying to get me to read.

445
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,460
 And I thought, if some lady can get an entire book

446
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,260
 out of it, maybe I can get 10 minutes.

447
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,940
 So I flipped to Hosea and I start reading.

448
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,620
 When the Lord began to speak through Hosea,

449
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,340
 the Lord said to him, go, marry a promiscuous woman

450
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,700
 and have children with her for like an adulterous wife,

451
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,700
 this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord.

452
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,300
 So he married Gomer, daughter of Diblium,

453
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,860
 and she conceived and bore him a son.

454
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,860
 And I closed my Bible and I walked away.

455
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,420
 And for the next 24 hours, all I heard was,

456
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,260
 that's you, that's you, that's you.

457
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,260
 Here are all these people who have been faithful,

458
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,300
 who have never struggled with doubt

459
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,340
 and never wanted to die and never questioned God's plan.

460
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,340
 And then there's you, like an adulterous woman

461
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,900
 towards God.

462
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,340
 And I can't stop thinking about that.

463
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,980
 And I don't know if people could tell if I was just down

464
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,340
 or if something was wrong,

465
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,060
 but I like to think it was the Holy Spirit.

466
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,700
 But I was sitting on the bathroom floor

467
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,060
 just having a little bit of a meltdown.

468
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,380
 Because not only were people around me experiencing God,

469
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,220
 I felt like I had, God, I felt like I'd never even known,

470
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,860
 but now I was aware of how deeply unfaithful

471
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 I had been towards God in the first place.

472
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,900
 Like why would God ever even want to change me

473
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:52,220
 if I never acted like I ever even really wanted Him?

474
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:59,860
 And as I'm sitting on the floor, I hear footsteps

475
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,820
 and they're angry and they're coming in fast

476
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,660
 in my direction.

477
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,300
 And I panicked 'cause I wasn't supposed

478
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,660
 to be in this bathroom.

479
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
 But the door flies open.

480
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,580
 And before I'm able to say anything or do anything,

481
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,580
 I see this student, a girl I had met on the plane

482
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,500
 on my way to this missions group

483
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,940
 who had the complete opposite personality of me.

484
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,940
 She was joyful and she was loud and she loved everyone

485
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,060
 and she wanted to hug everyone and she woke up happy.

486
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,060
 And she's standing at the door and I'm thinking, why you?

487
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,380
 And she looks at me dead in the eye

488
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,380
 with some frustration in her face.

489
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:58,500
 And she yells, you are worth it.

490
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,380
 You are worth it.

491
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:15,180
 Now go finish reading whatever God has asked you to read.

492
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,540
 And then she leaves.

493
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:25,700
 And I deeply confused because again, I'm not charismatic,

494
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,700
 wonder back to my room and I open up my Bible back to Hosea

495
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,980
 and I start reading again where I left off.

496
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,900
 And I finally get to chapter three.

497
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:45,100
 It says, the Lord said to me, go again.

498
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:52,380
 Love a woman who is loved by another man

499
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,380
 and is an adulteress even as the Lord loves

500
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,500
 the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods

501
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,420
 and love cakes of raisins.

502
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,420
 So I bought her for 15 shekels of silver

503
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,580
 and a Homer and a lake chest of barley.

504
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,580
 And I said to her, you must dwell as mine.

505
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,020
 For many days you shall not play the whore

506
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,020
 or belong to another man still, so will I also be to you.

507
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,380
 For the children of Israel shall dwell many days

508
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,100
 without king or prince, without sacrifice

509
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,220
 or pillar without ephod or household gods.

510
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,220
 Afterward, the children of Israel shall return

511
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,580
 and seek the Lord their God and David their king.

512
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:52,180
 And they shall come in fear to the Lord

513
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,900
 and to his goodness in the latter days.

514
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,700
 And as I read these words, I began to weep.

515
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:10,740
 And I feel as if the Holy Spirit says,

516
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,740
 if that's you, who am I?

517
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:22,100
 In this story, if you are the woman,

518
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,780
 if you are like Israel, then who am I?

519
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,340
 And as I said earlier, there is so much depth

520
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,060
 packed into this book that not just every sentence

521
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,400
 but every word means something.

522
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,380
 And the literal meaning of the name Hosea,

523
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,380
 the root of that name means to save, to deliver.

524
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:56,900
 Here is a woman who has said to Hosea, I'm yours.

525
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,940
 I'm here.

526
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,220
 And Hosea, knowing her promise would be faulty

527
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,900
 still enters into a covenant relationship with her.

528
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,620
 Much like God has willingly entered

529
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:15,620
 a covenant relationship with us, an unfaithful people.

530
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:24,540
 And much like us, so much like me.

531
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,100
 After time not feeling like I was getting

532
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,300
 what I thought I ought to get from God,

533
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,340
 this woman leaves her husband and goes into town

534
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,980
 with the mission of unfaithfulness,

535
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,980
 probably hoping something else would meet her needs,

536
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,260
 would make her happy, would give her what she felt

537
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,860
 like she desperately needed.

538
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,060
 All the while she must also wonder

539
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,060
 does he even see me?

540
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:02,580
 Does he care that I've gone?

541
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:09,060
 Such a mix of unhealthy but real feelings

542
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:17,900
 so many of us have felt about the God of the universe.

543
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:23,580
 I don't care, but does he?

544
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:30,140
 I don't want to be faithful, will he?

545
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:37,540
 And the reality is this is far after Deuteronomy takes place

546
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,540
 so Hosea could have rightfully said, I want a divorce.

547
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,260
 And that probably was something on both of their minds

548
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,460
 but God speaks to Hosea and says, go again,

549
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,740
 love a woman who is loved by another man

550
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,820
 and is an adulteress even as the Lord loves

551
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,340
 the children of Israel though they turn to other gods.

552
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,540
 Though they turn to other gods, go and love her again.

553
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,140
 You see, some of you in here know the pain,

554
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,380
 the real pain that unfaithfulness causes

555
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,820
 in the midst of a covenant relationship.

556
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,260
 And so hearing this part of the story feels unfathomable.

557
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:27,860
 And even more so is that a God who has never sinned

558
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,140
 against us has the soul right to walk away

559
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,980
 and yet watch what he does.

560
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,500
 Hosea tells us, so I bought her.

561
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,460
 This gives us insight into the view of woman

562
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,420
 at this time.

563
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,340
 By many cultures, women were seen as property

564
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,100
 but not by God.

565
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:01,660
 The interesting thing was because Hosea already married her,

566
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,260
 she would have been seen as his.

567
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,660
 He literally could have gone into town and said,

568
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,380
 this is mine and taken her back home.

569
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:19,740
 But he wants to make something abundantly clear to her

570
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,180
 in the language and the action of this time.

571
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:30,460
 He wants her to know you are worth it.

572
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,780
 So he sacrifices.

573
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,860
 As we read this, are you able to see the story

574
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,460
 within the story?

575
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,940
 The narrative of Hosea is not just a beautiful story

576
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,860
 of faithfulness, it is a foreshadowing

577
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,660
 of Christ on the cross.

578
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,100
 We being God's creation, we are his to begin with.

579
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,540
 And yet God has given us agency to make the choices we make.

580
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,740
 If we want to be unfaithful,

581
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,620
 he doesn't keep us locked up as his property

582
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,340
 but allows us to leave.

583
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,340
 And yet, even after we have left,

584
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
 he pursues us.

585
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:31,340
 Not in anger, not as a tyrant,

586
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,540
 not even as the owner of our souls,

587
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,900
 even though he could with the snap of his fingers

588
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,620
 demand that we come home.

589
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:47,060
 He chose to come after us in an act of sacrifice

590
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,700
 to buy what was already his.

591
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,420
 God sends his son to die in our place

592
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,140
 and through that, through that very action,

593
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,300
 we become worth it.

594
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:09,180
 If we are Gomer and if we are Israel,

595
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,580
 God is our faithful savior.

596
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,340
 And it was in that moment when I looked back

597
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,020
 over every single thing that had happened in my life,

598
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,140
 every time I ran from God,

599
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,100
 every time I felt like he left me alone,

600
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,580
 every time I wondered if he saw me

601
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,580
 and I realized I have been relentlessly pursued.

602
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,780
 You have been relentlessly pursued.

603
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,380
 It doesn't matter what you've done.

604
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,580
 It doesn't matter how far you have gone.

605
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,220
 It doesn't matter the things you have said

606
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,500
 because the one, the only one who is faithful

607
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,340
 is the one who has bought you for a price

608
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,980
 and named you and called you and brought you here.

609
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:18,380
 I know the reality is that some of you are hearing this

610
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,700
 and you're thinking, yeah, that's great for other people,

611
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,980
 but not me.

612
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:30,700
 And I have to say, if you're feeling that

613
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,260
 or you're thinking that

614
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,980
 and you're hearing this,

615
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,100
 might this be a grand gesture

616
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,740
 of God's relentless pursuit towards you?

617
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:50,100
 I think God wants to meet with you

618
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,820
 and I hope and I think

619
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,340
 that he's using this right now

620
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,060
 as the girl who burst through the door saying,

621
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,380
 you are worth it.

622
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,860
 Because think about what are the chances actually

623
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:19,100
 that you're in this room hearing this right now?

624
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,140
 And that God said to me,

625
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,340
 this is the message that I want you to share

626
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,300
 for that person.

627
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,620
 Maybe you're thinking that I'm unfaithful.

628
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,460
 Yes.

629
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:42,300
 I have been hurt by others and I have hurt others.

630
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,140
 Yes.

631
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,340
 I am constantly running away.

632
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,420
 Yes.

633
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,980
 But what is the picture that God has painted for us?

634
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,340
 It's this.

635
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,380
 Whether it is the idolatry of the Israelites

636
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,260
 or the adultery of Gomorrah,

637
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,260
 our hearts sinful condition is to wander far from God.

638
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:16,260
 But God's promise to us we find in Hosea 2, 19 through 20.

639
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,140
 It says,

640
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:27,740
 and I will betroth you to me forever.

641
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,740
 I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice,

642
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,100
 in steadfast love and in mercy.

643
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,100
 I will betroth you to me in faithfulness

644
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,700
 and you shall know the Lord.

645
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,700
 His promise to us is his love, his compassion

646
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,620
 and most significantly his faithfulness.

647
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,620
 And with that by no feat of our own strength,

648
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,500
 but only through his sacrifice,

649
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,500
 he declares us worthy of being brought home.

650
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,460
 So how should we respond?

651
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:19,140
 If you have not made the choice

652
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,860
 to willingly go back home with God,

653
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,860
 why not now?

654
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,380
 Why not tonight?

655
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,940
 And if you have made that choice,

656
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:43,140
 would you let today be a deeply joyful reminder

657
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,820
 to look back and to celebrate God's faithfulness to you?

658
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,700
 Some of you, I was praying for our time.

659
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,820
 I'm gonna go off script a little bit.

660
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,060
 I was praying for our time coming up

661
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,500
 and I couldn't picture the room

662
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,500
 because I've never been in a room this big before.

663
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,300
 And so I felt like the Lord just started showing me faces

664
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,100
 and asking me to pray.

665
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,740
 And as I was praying, I just felt like the Lord said,

666
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,980
 "Some of the people here,

667
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,980
 "your inclination has been not to sing during worship

668
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,100
 "because God doesn't feel good.

669
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,180
 "He doesn't feel close.

670
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,620
 "He doesn't feel loving.

671
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,980
 "He doesn't feel caring."

672
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,460
 I've been there.

673
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,540
 But this last year I read through the Psalms

674
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,940
 and I always thought the Psalmists were bad songwriters

675
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,540
 'cause they repeat themselves over and over and over again.

676
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,380
 But what I come to realize as I read through this last year

677
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,300
 that they don't repeat themselves

678
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,660
 because they're bad songwriters.

679
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:01,340
 They repeat themselves because their hearts are fickle

680
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,780
 and they need the reminder of God's character

681
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,100
 in their life that it is unchanging.

682
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:16,820
 Some of you need that reminding so desperately.

683
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:21,660
 If you made the choice tonight, I'm gonna do something.

684
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,780
 I want everyone to stand up really quick.

685
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,780
 If you made the choice to willingly go with God,

686
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,300
 and I need to say this,

687
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,900
 I know we are in the Bible belt

688
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,180
 and I know I'm asking you to do something deeply vulnerable,

689
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,100
 but I wanna say you are in community.

690
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:47,100
 You are in the context of a place where you are not alone.

691
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,980
 You are in the context of a place

692
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,380
 with people who care deeply for you.

693
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,700
 They want healing and rescue for you.

694
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,220
 They want you to do life in community.

695
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,820
 They don't want you to do it alone.

696
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,700
 So if you have been wrestling and tonight you either decided

697
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,300
 I'm going to go back home, it feels scary.

698
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,420
 It feels overwhelming, but I'm ready.

699
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,420
 I'm ready to go back home.

700
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,420
 Or if you're sitting here going,

701
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,860
 if I wanna go back home,

702
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:24,540
 I'm just gonna ask you to sit where you're at.

703
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:30,460
 And if you're comfortable with the people around you

704
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,900
 placing their hands on you or just extending a hand

705
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,700
 so we can pray for you.

706
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,900
 But I wanna read our inheritance over us tonight

707
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,540
 because I want you to be so aware

708
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,060
 of what the Lord has done.

709
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,900
 Would you just close your eyes?

710
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:04,180
 Psalm 23 says, "The Lord is my shepherd.

711
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,660
 I shall not want.

712
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,460
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

713
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,540
 He leads me besides still waters.

714
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,220
 He restores my soul.

715
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,340
 He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.

716
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,020
 Even though I walk through the valley

717
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,940
 of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

718
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,100
 For you are with me, your rod and your staff,

719
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,380
 they comfort me.

720
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,380
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies

721
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,820
 and you anoint my head with oil.

722
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,340
 My cup overflows.

723
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:57,220
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me

724
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,660
 all the days of my life.

725
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,740
 And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

726
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,180
 God, I just ask that you would be in this room

727
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,180
 and fill in the gaps that I missed.

728
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,700
 Lord, the ways that I stumbled, you are sufficient.

729
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:19,220
 You know what is going on in this room tonight.

730
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,220
 You know what is happening.

731
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,860
 You know what's stirring in the hearts of those

732
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,620
 in this place, God.

733
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:32,260
 For those who have wandered far off from you,

734
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,580
 for those who feel like it's too late

735
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,860
 or for those who feel apathetic,

736
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,820
 would you remind them of your deep love for them?

737
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:49,300
 God, I thank you for what you are doing in this room.

738
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,380
 Would you just continue to move

739
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,580
 as we sing in faithfulness, amen.

740
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,080
 (music fades)
