 [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,400
 Hey, brothers and sisters.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
 Welcome to the porch in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,760
 So good to be with you all and also joining us live,

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,240
 Porch Live locations in greater Lafayette

7
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,560
 and Indianapolis, Indiana.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,840
 I don't know what happened to lesser Lafayette, but no shade.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,160
 Then we've got Tulsa, Oklahoma.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,080
 And with us for the first time this year,

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,560
 Porch Live Fort Worth, Texas.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,080
 Welcome.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,720
 So good to be with you all.

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,440
 So a couple of weeks ago, I shared

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,520
 that I'm a recovered alcoholic.

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,800
 And when I drank, I smoked.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,680
 Like, that went hand in hand.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,120
 Show of hands if you love smoking.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,360
 Just kidding.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,960
 We'll get there.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,560
 But I saw-- you're like, yeah, actually.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,320
 Me too.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,160
 Like, whenever I drank, I smoked.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,440
 It was like-- it was something I loved.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,560
 And so I would like--

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,000
 I guess it probably started like in the eighth grade.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,720
 If you've never smoked, and you're like,

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,160
 why is he hitting them?

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
 You don't know.

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,680
 But you're about to.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
 Yeah, in the eighth grade, like, started smoking.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
 And then we'd go out in Austin.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,680
 And just after a few drinks, like, smoking just

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,880
 sounded nice.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,360
 Stressful day at work, smoking sounded nice.

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,280
 It was like-- it's just a thing that I enjoyed.

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
 And I'm not looking to create a stumbling block for anybody,

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,200
 but there was like some satisfaction to it.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
 It's like I knew that it would give me

40
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,760
 a little bit of relaxation and rest to, like, decompress some,

41
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,320
 get to be outside.

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
 It was like-- even though I knew, I mean,

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,400
 Surgeon General warning.

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,120
 I mean, it's right there.

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,320
 What does this one say?

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,280
 Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,900
 to your health.

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,880
 You know, I knew that it caused cancer.

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,800
 But it didn't really matter much to me,

50
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,320
 because it was kind of satisfying.

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,000
 So here it was.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 See, I got a nice pack on that one.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
 I haven't lost it.

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,160
 I haven't had a cigarette in 17 years.

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,880
 But--

56
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:53,680
 [LAUGHTER]

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,560
 I wish we could show your face to everyone.

58
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,800
 [LAUGHTER]

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,760
 She's like--

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
 [LAUGHTER]

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
 But frozen.

62
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,960
 Because it was nice.

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,520
 It was like--

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 [LAUGHTER]

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,880
 Oh, if you're-- so I was like, oh my goodness, he really is.

66
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,320
 If you're a smoker, you know that I didn't inhale.

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,560
 You know, the smoke looks different when it comes out

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,800
 of your mouth when you inhale.

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
 Just for technicality purposes, I'm not inhaling it

70
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,720
 like I'm Bill Clinton, like, I didn't get high.

71
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,000
 [LAUGHTER]

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,760
 Like, sure you didn't, Bill.

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
 But even just like tasting it, it's like, this is nice.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,960
 Some of you are like, I've seen people pull out their phones,

75
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,120
 take picture or video.

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,720
 It's OK.

77
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,400
 Go ahead, man.

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,900
 Go ahead.

79
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,480
 [LAUGHTER]

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,980
 Here.

81
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,640
 Here, you go.

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,840
 You do you, man.

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
 You do you.

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
 What's up?

85
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,640
 I'll tag you.

86
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,080
 [LAUGHTER]

87
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,160
 You're pulling out your phones and taking pictures

88
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,440
 because you're like, what is going on?

89
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
 Someone's smoking.

90
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,800
 But like, surely-- I mean, you've seen someone smoke

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,120
 before, right?

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,760
 Mr. Cameraman over there?

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,920
 Unofficial camera guy?

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,880
 Yeah, you've seen someone smoke before, right?

95
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
 So why are you--

96
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,340
 like, why are you taking a picture?

97
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,180
 Why are you filming?

98
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,720
 Because you're like, it's in church.

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,360
 That's why.

100
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,000
 Like, we've seen people smoke, but not in church.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,840
 Like, oh, that's new.

102
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
 Wow.

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
 Why you're smoking in church?

104
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,200
 That's crazy.

105
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:45,480
 What is exponentially crazier is unforgiveness in church.

106
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,000
 Like, you think that's crazy?

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
 You pull out your phone for that?

108
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
 Like, oh, man, I'm going to blast this guy.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
 He's about to get fired.

110
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
 Like, you can't do that in here.

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
 Why?

112
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
 Seeing people smoke out there, it's

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
 because I was smoking in church.

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,160
 To have unforgiveness here in the church

115
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,920
 is exponentially and eternally crazier than smoking in church.

116
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,120
 But here we are, the forgiven ones.

117
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,840
 Of all the 8 billion people walking this earth,

118
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,080
 we have been forgiven by Jesus Christ, our Lord.

119
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,160
 And here we go, walking in here, singing our songs

120
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,440
 to the Lord who's forgiven us, while we harbor unforgiveness

121
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,040
 in our hearts towards somebody who hurt us.

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,000
 That's messed up.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,760
 And we need to like flip the camera around and be like,

124
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,520
 oh, it's me.

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
 Like, I'm the ridiculous one.

126
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
 I'm the one I should be videoing.

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,800
 The audacity in church to have unforgiveness,

128
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,640
 it's the most contrary thing to the gospel,

129
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,360
 the good news of Jesus Christ, that we've been forgiven.

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,840
 And so like smoking, and the reason why it's like--

131
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,680
 there is a reason why I don't do it anymore.

132
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,960
 Though it was satisfying to me, it was killing me, right?

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,120
 Like, it's causing cancer to me.

134
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
 I always thought, like, what are the odds?

135
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,760
 Like, I'm going to die of something,

136
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,080
 but I doubt it's going to be smoking.

137
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
 And so I'm like, I'll just--

138
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,040
 I'll roll the dice on that one.

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,600
 Even though it was causing like cancer--

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,440
 well, cancerous smoke to come into my body,

141
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,960
 fill me up, addicted to nicotine for 12 years.

142
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,440
 But not only that, like, I remember, you know,

143
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,120
 at work or at a bar, someone would be like,

144
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,240
 are you a smoker?

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,920
 I'd be like, no.

146
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,280
 Be like, no, I can smell it on your breath.

147
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,000
 Because when you're smoking, you're just in it.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
 Everyone else can tell, but you think

149
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,280
 because you smoked, you can't smell it on you.

150
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,040
 And then it also affects other people.

151
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,200
 Like, secondhand smoke is a real thing,

152
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,040
 and it can cause cancer to them.

153
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
 It can hurt kids.

154
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,080
 Like, if you're just like--

155
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,320
 I mean, I grew up in the '80s, man.

156
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,600
 We'd like hotbox with cigarettes,

157
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
 with the kids in the back.

158
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,880
 Cigarettes, not weed.

159
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
 Typically in the carpool on the way to soccer.

160
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,160
 But nonetheless, it hurts other people.

161
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,840
 Like, secondhand smoke hurts people.

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,880
 And so does unforgiveness.

163
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,200
 Like, unforgiveness, there's some satisfaction to it.

164
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
 You're like, oh, you hurt me?

165
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
 Well, guess what?

166
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,520
 You're dead to me.

167
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
 Like, I'm gonna block you out of my life,

168
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,200
 walls up emotionally, relationally, spiritually.

169
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,080
 Like, I'm like, hate you in my heart,

170
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,560
 even though I may see you,

171
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,920
 still like your thing on Instagram, you know, follow you.

172
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
 But I'm gonna flatter you,

173
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
 and we're gonna act like we're okay,

174
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,000
 but I actually like, I kinda hate you.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
 I don't forgive you.

176
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,120
 Gives me satisfaction to do so.

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,160
 But that's actually killing you inside.

178
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,040
 Unforgiveness, it's been said, is like drinking poison

179
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,880
 and wishing that the other person would die.

180
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
 Like, you're the one that's suffering

181
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,640
 in your unforgiveness.

182
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,040
 They're going about their life like, I don't know.

183
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,320
 I didn't even know that I hurt them.

184
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,440
 Or maybe I did, but they don't care.

185
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
 But you're the one dying inside

186
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
 because of your unforgiveness.

187
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,960
 And then in Hebrews 12, it says,

188
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
 beware that a root of bitterness

189
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,040
 doesn't grow up and defile many.

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,800
 So like secondhand smoke, unforgiveness will spread.

191
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,960
 Your bitterness and resentment and unforgiveness

192
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
 will begin to spread to your other relationships

193
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
 as you're just like toxic with that unforgiveness.

194
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
 And so as we're talking about the return of Jesus Christ,

195
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,020
 and he is returning, we don't know the day or the hour,

196
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,000
 but it is a certain fact.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,760
 He came once, he's coming again.

198
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,840
 Will he find us, the forgiven ones,

199
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,640
 being unforgiven to our fellow brother or sister?

200
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,880
 And so here's the deal, like in every relationship,

201
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,680
 every relationship, there is sin.

202
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,960
 One, 'cause you're in it,

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,160
 and two, 'cause another person is.

204
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,720
 And so there's sin in that relationship.

205
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,420
 It doesn't matter if it's your coworker, your roommate,

206
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,180
 your friend you're sitting by tonight, family of origin,

207
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,460
 whoever it is, you have sin in the relationship.

208
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,720
 Some's gonna be by you, some will be caused by you,

209
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
 others will be against you, but there's gonna be sin.

210
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,240
 And so we've gotta know how to deal with that sin.

211
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,560
 And how we deal with sin is how God dealt with our sin

212
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,600
 through Jesus, which is by forgiveness.

213
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
 And so we've gotta be a people

214
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,600
 that when there's a foul in the relationship,

215
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,820
 that we can forgive or seek forgiveness

216
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,400
 so that that sin doesn't have a place

217
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,880
 just bringing cancer into the relationship.

218
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,520
 My son had a basketball, our oldest son,

219
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,420
 had a basketball game this past weekend,

220
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,200
 and they lost by like three points.

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
 And he was so frustrated when he come off,

222
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,000
 he's like, "Dad, those were the worst refs ever.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,560
 "There were so many fouls,

224
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,060
 "and they weren't calling any of them."

225
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,680
 Which is how we feel when we're sinned against,

226
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,760
 like, "Oh my goodness, did you not know that was a foul?

227
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,600
 "You can't treat people that way."

228
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,280
 And we want justice for them, but then when we sin,

229
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,680
 man, we want like mercy and grace.

230
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,320
 We want somebody to call a foul.

231
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,080
 And so here it is, this is where we're going tonight.

232
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,560
 If there's been a foul in a relationship,

233
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,800
 somebody did something they shouldn't do,

234
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,400
 maybe you did what you shouldn't do.

235
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,040
 It's F, it stands for follow God, not your feelings.

236
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,900
 O, own your part.

237
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,520
 U, move from unrest in the relationship to unity.

238
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,680
 And then L, love like God.

239
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,520
 So that's where we're gonna be tonight.

240
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,440
 And here's what I would say is that

241
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
 when there's a foul in a relationship,

242
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,160
 we need to gospel our relationships.

243
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,280
 When there's a foul, we need to gospel our relationship.

244
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,720
 Grammarians call this denominalization.

245
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
 It's when you take a noun and you use it as a verb.

246
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,720
 So when I say, "Hey, we need to gospel our relationship,

247
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,060
 "the gospel is that God is holy, we sin,

248
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,900
 "so he sent his son, Jesus, to live a perfect life,

249
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,740
 "die the death that we deserve

250
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,380
 "so that we could be forgiven,

251
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,380
 "raised again to show that he was God in flesh,

252
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,380
 "that whoever believes in him will not perish,

253
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,360
 "but have eternal life."

254
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,760
 That is the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ,

255
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
 and how you can be forgiven of your sins.

256
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
 And so when I say we need to gospel our relationship,

257
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
 gospel being noun,

258
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,720
 it's because in the gospel,

259
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,480
 it's that there is sin that is separated.

260
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
 Well, that happens in our earthly relationships

261
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,960
 as well as our spiritual relationship with God.

262
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,120
 There's sin that's been committed,

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,400
 so it's acknowledged, it's confessed.

264
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,140
 Then there's forgiveness

265
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,200
 in the midst of that sin, relationally.

266
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,360
 There is with God and there should be with us.

267
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,000
 And then there's reconciliation.

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,580
 It says that we've been reconciled back to God

269
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,640
 through his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.

270
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,340
 And so there's an aim at reconciliation

271
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,260
 when there's sin that is separated.

272
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,160
 So we need to gospel our relationships.

273
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,840
 You think about like some of the words that are used,

274
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,740
 like I Googled it.

275
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,540
 Well, Google is not a verb, it's a noun,

276
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
 it's a search engine.

277
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,940
 Like you can't, it's a noun,

278
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,980
 but we take it and we make it into a verb.

279
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,740
 Or you say they friended me.

280
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,300
 You know, Facebook brought that one in.

281
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,700
 It's like, well, friend is a noun,

282
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,420
 but now we've used it as a verb.

283
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,700
 I was staring at, I stayed in an Airbnb

284
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,420
 and I laid down on the bed

285
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,260
 and the bed like, came up on both sides of me.

286
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
 I was like, nah, no.

287
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,620
 So I emailed the guy, I'm like,

288
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,420
 "Hey man, we're gonna have to work out a discount

289
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,820
 "or something because your bed just tacoed me."

290
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,020
 I didn't have explained to him what he meant.

291
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,260
 And in the same way, we've got to gospel our relationship.

292
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,900
 We have received the gospel.

293
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,940
 Now we give and live the gospel when there is a foul.

294
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,860
 So first, follow God, not feelings.

295
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,020
 You know, your feelings are gonna lead you to think

296
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,380
 and believe and desire like, no, no, I know.

297
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,860
 No, you don't understand.

298
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,060
 Like, that's great that you're gonna talk about forgiveness.

299
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,980
 You don't know what happened to me

300
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,300
 with maybe the sexual abuse you suffered

301
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,980
 or the emotional abuse or the sin that was committed

302
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,940
 maybe by your ex against you or a friend that betrayed you

303
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,500
 or a worker that like, did you wrong

304
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,180
 with your relationship there at work or lied about you.

305
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,020
 Who knows what it's like.

306
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,300
 Hey, I'm gonna forgive some things, but that one, nah, never.

307
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,940
 Not that person, not that time.

308
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,260
 Not as many times as they did it over and over and over.

309
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,900
 They said, sorry, and then they did it on repeat.

310
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,060
 So no, no, I'm not gonna forgive them.

311
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,740
 That's our feelings.

312
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
 But God's gonna give us a different way.

313
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,460
 God's gonna show us in his eternal,

314
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,980
 inerrant truth, the way to live.

315
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,300
 Because if we don't,

316
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,780
 if we follow our feelings instead of God,

317
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,420
 you're literally in the jail cell.

318
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,020
 They're free.

319
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,660
 You're the one that has self-imprisoned yourself

320
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,100
 in a prison of unforgiveness.

321
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,260
 And you hold the key.

322
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,580
 Like the key being the cross,

323
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,820
 the gospel will unlock that prison of unforgiveness

324
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,980
 that you can go free.

325
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
 And so we follow God, not our feelings.

326
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,220
 And obedience is not determined by the outcome.

327
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,300
 And so like, if you're like,

328
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,620
 man, I know they're not even gonna let,

329
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
 they're not even gonna be sorry.

330
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,940
 There'll be no remorse.

331
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,440
 They'll probably do it again.

332
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,220
 It's like, we still, God's asking you to step into it

333
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,660
 for you to be faithful, regardless of how they respond.

334
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,980
 You're not responsible for their response.

335
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,460
 There's a phrase out in the world that says,

336
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,620
 time heals all wounds.

337
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,460
 You've heard that, right?

338
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
 Like time heals all wounds.

339
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,820
 It doesn't.

340
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,900
 Time makes wounds worse.

341
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 Because like, I can't believe you've never addressed that.

342
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,480
 Now you, if you sin against someone,

343
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,020
 you might think time heals all wounds

344
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,420
 'cause you've gotten some time, space and distance from it.

345
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,700
 But if you're the one that's been hurt,

346
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,380
 you're like, I can't believe it.

347
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,040
 That happened when we were in high school.

348
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,060
 That happened in college.

349
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,260
 That happened, you know, all my life growing up

350
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,700
 and they've never said a word about it.

351
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,220
 Time doesn't heal all wounds.

352
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,160
 Time will make you be unforgiving and bitter.

353
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,480
 I was backpacking through Europe.

354
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,460
 I was in Hungary.

355
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,200
 I finished a water bottle.

356
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,880
 And I took it as I was walking.

357
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,420
 And I just like threw it in the trash can, kept walking.

358
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,580
 And all of a sudden I hear like in Hungarian,

359
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,780
 which I don't speak, like,

360
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,540
 (imitates gunfire)

361
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,460
 somebody yelling.

362
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,820
 And I was like, dude, somebody just got mugged.

363
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,880
 And I turned around and then I see this Hungarian woman,

364
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,820
 like reaching into the trash can

365
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,380
 and like pulls out the water bottle.

366
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,140
 And now she's walking at me like,

367
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,660
 (imitates gunfire)

368
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,500
 yelling at me.

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,700
 And I'm like, I don't know.

370
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,540
 I'm so sorry.

371
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,180
 I don't speak.

372
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,280
 I'm sorry.

373
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,640
 And she goes, she goes, still yelling.

374
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,060
 (water bottle crunching)

375
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,740
 Ha, just walks away.

376
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,220
 I have crushed every water bottle since.

377
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,640
 Never do I ever drink a water bottle and not crush it.

378
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,200
 Hungarian woman, you may be watching online.

379
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,040
 I doubt it.

380
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,860
 Maybe your kids.

381
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,700
 Thank you.

382
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,000
 The reason why she was so offended,

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 she's like, that's taking up space in a place that I love.

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,900
 Like, maybe you don't care about your country,

385
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,320
 but I love my country.

386
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,280
 And you ugly American,

387
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,920
 that thing has taken up space in this place that I love.

388
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,280
 And I think God's looking at all the sin

389
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,520
 that has been committed against us

390
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,440
 that's taken up space in a place that he loves.

391
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,080
 You, your heart, your soul, your mind.

392
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,280
 He's like, crush it.

393
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,720
 Crush it.

394
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,040
 Crush it at the cross.

395
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,960
 I dealt with it.

396
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,240
 It's why I came.

397
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,240
 It is taking up space in a place that I love.

398
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,080
 And so you've got two options

399
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,320
 to follow God and not feelings.

400
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,280
 One is to overlook it.

401
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,680
 If it's something where you're like, man, grace,

402
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,240
 like I've sinned against people.

403
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,920
 I understand, like grace.

404
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,720
 It says in Proverbs 19, 11,

405
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,200
 it is to a man or woman's glory,

406
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,480
 glory to overlook an offense.

407
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,760
 They'll be like, man, I forgive them.

408
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,920
 They don't, I don't need to go

409
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,260
 and have some sit down reconciliation meeting.

410
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,080
 Like, man, I sinned, they sinned against me.

411
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
 Grace, forgiven.

412
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,280
 If you can't, if you're like ruminating on it,

413
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,800
 you're gonna leave here thinking about it.

414
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,680
 You hang up the phone.

415
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
 You're like, no, no, no, no.

416
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,900
 I can't believe that.

417
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,600
 Then your next step is this.

418
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,800
 It's Leviticus 19.

419
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,040
 You didn't think we're going Leviticus.

420
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
 We are.

421
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
 You don't go Old Testament on them that way though.

422
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
 You do this.

423
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,600
 It says, you shall not hate your brother in your heart.

424
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,400
 Now we're getting personal.

425
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,240
 But, so in order that you don't hate them in your heart,

426
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
 God's like, here's the antidote.

427
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,440
 Like they sinned against you, you're gonna hate them.

428
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,040
 Like they hurt you, rightfully so.

429
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,520
 Like what you're feeling is a sense of justice.

430
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,560
 Like, man, what you did was terrible.

431
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,880
 So God's antidote to not hating them in the heart,

432
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,080
 the way that you're gonna get that hate

433
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,920
 out of your heart is this.

434
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,960
 But you shall reason frankly with your neighbor.

435
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,240
 So you go to them and you talk to them about it.

436
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,640
 And then this next part, he says,

437
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,960
 lest you incur sin on behalf of them.

438
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,340
 It's like, hey, if something is done to you,

439
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,560
 you gotta go talk to them if you can't overlook it.

440
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,240
 Because if you don't, you're gonna hate them in your heart.

441
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,900
 And then you're in sin because of the sin

442
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,960
 that they committed because you're now hating them.

443
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,280
 That's crazy.

444
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,120
 But it's true.

445
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,940
 That's reality.

446
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,780
 That's how God sees this.

447
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,800
 Lest you incur sin because of him.

448
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,720
 You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge

449
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,560
 against the sons of your own people.

450
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,400
 Here it is.

451
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 This is the second great command.

452
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,660
 But you shall love your neighbor as yourself.

453
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,320
 God's like, well, how would you wanna be treated?

454
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,120
 Would you want them to hate you in your heart?

455
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,100
 Would you want them to hold a grudge?

456
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,540
 No, I didn't think so.

457
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,160
 Love them as you would wanna be loved.

458
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,280
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

459
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,400
 And then in case he's like, this is like,

460
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,720
 you know, God's way of putting a period on a sentence.

461
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,400
 He says, I am the Lord.

462
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,040
 Like, it's not a suggestion.

463
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,200
 I'm God.

464
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,240
 Don't tangle with it.

465
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,840
 So I want you to like, you know, if you need to,

466
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,980
 close your eyes, look down, pull out your phone,

467
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,400
 take a note.

468
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,640
 But for a second, you know what?

469
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,200
 Close your eyes.

470
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
 Close your eyes.

471
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,040
 I want you to think about the first person

472
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,760
 that comes to your mind when you're like,

473
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,880
 man, I think it's this individual

474
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,100
 that I either need to forgive or seek their forgiveness.

475
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,940
 Who is it?

476
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,960
 Ask the Lord to reveal it to you, who that is.

477
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:07,640
 You follow God, not your feelings.

478
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,240
 And the O is that you own your part, own your part.

479
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,960
 Own 100% of your 2%, regardless of their percent.

480
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,320
 So maybe like in every conflict,

481
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,640
 like somebody's got something to own.

482
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,080
 And so it's like, well, no matter what my percentage is,

483
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,840
 I'm gonna own 2%, 15%, 20%.

484
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,280
 I'm gonna own 100% of whatever my percent

485
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,800
 in that conflict was, regardless of their percent.

486
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,320
 'Cause you may be like, well, my thing was little,

487
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,800
 but theirs was huge.

488
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
 And God's like, well, you deal with yours first.

489
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,160
 Like you go first.

490
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,000
 That's what happens.

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,600
 Laura was like, we were driving one time recently,

492
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,300
 and she's like, oh my goodness, something's in my eye.

493
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,840
 I was like, is it a log?

494
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,080
 Yeah, you shouldn't say that to your wife.

495
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,320
 She just like looked at me, she didn't even respond.

496
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,600
 Matthew 7 says, why do you see the speck

497
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 that is in your brother's eye,

498
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,440
 but you do not notice the log that is in your own eye?

499
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,600
 Or how can you say to your brother,

500
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,780
 let me take the speck out of your own eye

501
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,760
 when there's a log in your own eye?

502
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,160
 You hypocrite.

503
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,880
 First take the log out of your own eye,

504
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,440
 then you will be able to see clearly

505
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,080
 to take the speck out of your brother's eye.

506
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,360
 I think a lot of times we're like,

507
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,660
 man, I'm gonna own my part.

508
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,980
 And there's a phrase that's good.

509
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,580
 Like, hey, draw a circle around yourself,

510
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,180
 deal with everything in it.

511
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,660
 That's good, it's just incomplete.

512
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,820
 'Cause he says, take the log out of your eye,

513
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,660
 then you will be able to see clearly

514
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,260
 to take the speck out of your brother's.

515
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,620
 So it's not like, God's not asking you to be a doormat.

516
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,220
 Like, well, I guess I'll just own my sin

517
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,100
 and everybody gets to just like own me with their sin.

518
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,220
 No, like we're in a relationship.

519
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,800
 He's not asking you to stuff it or to withdraw.

520
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,880
 He's like, just own your part first.

521
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,880
 You bring humility to the table first

522
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
 and then take the speck out, but own your part first.

523
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,400
 If you want Satan in your life,

524
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,840
 anybody here like, yeah, man, that sounds awesome.

525
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,740
 I would love to have Satan in my life.

526
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,360
 God's answer for that is to go to bed angry.

527
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
 He says in Ephesians chapter four,

528
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,620
 that if you let the sun go down

529
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,660
 while you're still angry at someone,

530
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,660
 you have given Satan entrance into your life.

531
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,020
 Like that you've given him a foothold.

532
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,460
 You left the back door unlocked,

533
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
 like, man, nobody will probably break in.

534
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,180
 God's like, no, no, someone is checking the locks.

535
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,540
 And if you don't forgive them, that lock's open.

536
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,980
 He's coming in.

537
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,580
 You're gonna give him a foothold.

538
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,220
 And so as you think about owning your part,

539
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,900
 you're like, well, when do I do that?

540
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,180
 How do I do that?

541
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,740
 Here it is in Proverbs chapter six.

542
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,300
 We're gonna bounce around a lot in scripture tonight.

543
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,680
 Proverbs six says this.

544
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,100
 If you're ensnared by the words of your mouth,

545
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,300
 so you said something you shouldn't have said,

546
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,380
 caught in the words of your mouth,

547
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,100
 then do this, my son, and save yourself

548
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,240
 for you've come into the hand of your neighbor.

549
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,720
 Go.

550
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,440
 So there's like a personal movement towards the person.

551
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,620
 In this day of like text and DM and all that,

552
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,060
 God's like, no, in person's best, go.

553
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,780
 Hasten, he says, do it quickly.

554
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,580
 Plead urgently with your neighbor.

555
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,180
 Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber.

556
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,180
 He's like, don't even go to bed.

557
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,140
 If you've sinned against someone and you're like,

558
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,980
 well, man, when should I deal with this?

559
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,260
 He's like, today.

560
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,240
 Today you should deal with it.

561
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,100
 Because if you don't, you know what you're doing?

562
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,660
 Their son's gonna go down on their anger.

563
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,700
 And God is wanting us to come back together

564
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,220
 to gospel those relationships,

565
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,860
 as we are daily forgiven,

566
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,620
 to move towards forgiveness every single day.

567
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,580
 In Matthew 5, 23 through 24, it says,

568
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,500
 so if you're offering your gift at the altar,

569
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,660
 and there remember that your brother

570
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,340
 has something against you,

571
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,660
 leave your gift at the altar.

572
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,340
 First, go be reconciled, then come offer your gift.

573
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,500
 In this case, as we just sang like all those songs,

574
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,820
 I wonder if we had greeters at the door being like,

575
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,100
 hey, is there anybody that you've sinned against

576
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,500
 that you need to get things right with?

577
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,540
 'Cause if so, Jesus says, don't come in and sing songs.

578
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,280
 Like I wonder how many of us would even be here.

579
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,780
 Or if it would have been a lot more quiet,

580
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,180
 like, oh man, you know what?

581
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,780
 Yeah, let me, I need to call somebody.

582
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,900
 I need to reach out.

583
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,300
 Like, I've forgotten about that.

584
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,740
 I've never heard that verse.

585
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,460
 But he says to first go do this.

586
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,340
 There's such an importance.

587
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,300
 He's like, hey, we're good.

588
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,220
 Like we have an unbreakable, if you've trusted in Jesus,

589
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,540
 we have an unbreakable covenant,

590
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,100
 the new covenant that is unbreakable

591
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,780
 because of what God has done through Jesus,

592
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,620
 his life, death, and resurrection.

593
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,700
 We're gonna be good.

594
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,380
 Now that one horizontally, that relationship,

595
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,260
 like, I don't know where that's at.

596
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,900
 So he's like, leave your gift.

597
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,960
 I'll still be here.

598
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,000
 Go get that right and come back.

599
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
 I was a groomsman at a wedding.

600
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,780
 So much of my drunkenness happened in Austin, Texas.

601
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,500
 And that's funny, people are like laughing.

602
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,060
 It's like, yeah, that shoe fits.

603
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,620
 So we used to have this rent house

604
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,060
 and it was an amazing house, threw great parties at it.

605
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,460
 It was on 250 acres, but it was a 12 minute drive

606
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,100
 to downtown Austin, like best thing in the world.

607
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,420
 360 in Spotswood Springs.

608
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,740
 And we would like throw these parties.

609
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,620
 And then after we moved out, I was like,

610
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,480
 oh man, kind of hate to give up the house.

611
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,220
 Like, it's a great party spot.

612
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,100
 And I knew, 'cause the landlord was also the owner,

613
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,440
 it was her family's house,

614
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,620
 that she wasn't gonna get renters anytime soon

615
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,860
 and she would leave the utilities on.

616
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,500
 'Cause we just, she kept them in her name.

617
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,380
 So I was like, I'm gonna make a way to get back in here

618
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,940
 and we're still gonna throw parties.

619
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,140
 So I left one of the windows kind of,

620
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,780
 well, unhinged on the thing.

621
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,540
 And I would climb up over this, I don't know, like cellar

622
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,920
 to climb into this window, like pull myself up, get in,

623
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,780
 pop open the front door and be like, it's on,

624
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,700
 party's happening.

625
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,860
 Well, there's a word for that.

626
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,680
 There's a term in legal communities,

627
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,380
 it's called breaking and entering.

628
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,980
 And one time when I was in there,

629
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,340
 I like kicked out the chandelier and you're like,

630
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,460
 how did you kick a chandelier?

631
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,860
 I jumped and I got it.

632
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,060
 But like busted stuff, like used up utilities

633
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,400
 and just left a mess, you know, cigarettes,

634
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,100
 like in church, leaving on the floor,

635
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,240
 cans, bottles smashed.

636
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,840
 And then I trusted in Jesus.

637
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,500
 And I was back in Austin, I'd left Austin,

638
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,520
 now I was back in Austin and I was back in Austin

639
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,220
 as a believer, no longer an alcoholic or a drunk,

640
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,580
 now a disciple.

641
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,940
 And I'm there and I'm downtown and she had a store downtown.

642
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,460
 And I'm literally with my buddies who I used to party with

643
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,340
 at the house and I'm like,

644
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,180
 dude, I gotta go see Mrs. Wendland.

645
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,740
 And they're like, what?

646
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,580
 Her old landlord?

647
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,740
 I'm like, yeah, I gotta go see her.

648
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,260
 Like for what?

649
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,500
 I'm like, I smashed up her house,

650
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 like breaking and entering, like I mean, you were there.

651
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,980
 Like, I gotta go see her and make this right.

652
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,100
 And they're like, you know her husband's an attorney, right?

653
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,580
 Like, I've gotta go.

654
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,960
 And so I literally, I mean, I'm broke.

655
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,780
 I'd quit my job, I was going into ministry,

656
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,420
 like just in this study program, ATM, debit card,

657
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,860
 pull out whenever I could.

658
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,340
 I think it was 250 bucks, which was a ton for me.

659
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,940
 It was equivalent of like pulling out $10,000.

660
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,900
 Stick in my pocket, walk into her shop.

661
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,580
 And I'm like, she's not gonna remember me.

662
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,540
 This is gonna be so weird.

663
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,120
 And I walk in and she like looks up from the desk.

664
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,660
 She goes, oh, hey, John.

665
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,900
 Look, oh man, this just got worse.

666
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,080
 Like I wished you didn't remember me.

667
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,540
 I wish you hated me.

668
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,220
 She was like, how have you been?

669
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,780
 I was like, good.

670
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,580
 She's like, why are you here today?

671
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,820
 And I'm like, Mrs. Winland,

672
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,960
 I have something I need to tell you.

673
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,300
 I was owning my part.

674
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,220
 I was like, I used to break into your house after we left.

675
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,100
 I smashed out the chandelier, I threw parties.

676
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,060
 I'm sure you had to have people come clean it up,

677
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,420
 all the bottles and cans and cigarette butts.

678
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,700
 And I am so sorry.

679
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,700
 I was a drunk, alcoholic idiot, but that's no excuse.

680
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,420
 And I wanna start paying you back for cleaning fees

681
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,540
 and whatever you had to do with that light fixture.

682
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,420
 And like, this is what I can give you now

683
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,780
 and I will give you more later.

684
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,060
 And I'm so sorry.

685
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
 Will you please forgive me?

686
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,140
 With cash out.

687
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,060
 She literally pushes my hand back and says,

688
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,060
 John, don't worry about that.

689
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,340
 I don't even remember that.

690
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,900
 I don't know what you're talking about.

691
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,860
 You were always so kind.

692
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,300
 But John, I know someone who's also struggling

693
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,100
 with addiction, could you help them?

694
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,260
 I'm like, what?

695
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,260
 God, like the forgiveness in that moment,

696
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,020
 trying to own my part, trying to make an amends

697
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,140
 and how God uses even what I had done to help somebody else.

698
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,980
 I'm like, yeah, give anybody my number that I could help.

699
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,760
 I think what I said that day is one of the hardest phrases

700
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,900
 to say in the American English language.

701
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,160
 It's, will you please forgive me?

702
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,820
 I think it's one of the, I mean, the words,

703
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,620
 like you just like the pain

704
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,300
 and trying to muster them out of your mouth

705
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,180
 because it's just like, it's death to pride,

706
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,780
 death to self, death to ego and so essential.

707
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:48,140
 And so you say the phrase, will you please forgive me?

708
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,620
 And if it doesn't have a question mark on it,

709
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,140
 you did not ask them for forgiveness.

710
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,580
 Sometimes we're like, hey, please forgive me.

711
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,740
 It's like, what, you said it against me

712
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,940
 and now you're telling me what to do.

713
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,420
 You're telling me to forgive you,

714
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,820
 but you attach please to it.

715
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,660
 Try again.

716
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,740
 So say it with me.

717
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,760
 Will you please forgive me?

718
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,980
 One, two, three.

719
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,140
 Will you please forgive me?

720
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,180
 Like those words will transform your relationships.

721
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,780
 Those words will help gospel your relationship

722
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,400
 and it's never too late.

723
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,540
 It's never too late.

724
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,440
 It should mark us asking for an extending forgiveness.

725
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,500
 And then when somebody asks you,

726
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,080
 it's how you want to be treated.

727
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,340
 Like, yes, nothing but grace.

728
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,000
 Yeah, I've been forgiven by Jesus.

729
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,980
 Of course I forgive you.

730
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,300
 How could I ever hold anything against you?

731
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
 That would be as crazy as smoking in church.

732
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,300
 To be a part of the church and not forgive

733
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,540
 even though I have been forgiven in Jesus.

734
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,380
 And I wanna give you another phrase that like,

735
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,180
 if you're talking about like forgiveness and whatnot,

736
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,960
 here's a pro tip, this is free.

737
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,160
 The other night, my daughter, I didn't know,

738
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,120
 I walk into our bedroom,

739
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,960
 we just had our carpets cleaned for like $400,

740
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,360
 which you're like, that's a lot of money.

741
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,200
 Well, we have three kids, they trash our carpets.

742
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,320
 And so a week later, I walk into our master bedroom

743
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,360
 and I'm like, what in the world?

744
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,200
 There's blue spots, blue all over our carpet.

745
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,560
 I'm like, what happened?

746
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,080
 And Laura's like, Penny was in here doing handstands.

747
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,240
 And I'm like, with a blue marker, like what?

748
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,280
 And she's like, well, there was cookie cake

749
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,120
 and yeah, that's what it, I'm like, Penny, get in here.

750
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,880
 And Laura's like, no, no, no, hey, hey,

751
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,120
 that's a little much.

752
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,360
 And I'm like, no, no, it's not too much.

753
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,600
 Penny, get in here.

754
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,240
 Penny walks in, she already knows,

755
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,340
 she's like looking like dejected already.

756
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,800
 I'm like, what did you do?

757
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,360
 Do you see something wrong in this house?

758
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,680
 She's like, yes, she's seven.

759
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:49,480
 And I go, what happened, Penny?

760
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,880
 She's like, icing.

761
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,920
 I'm like, how, Penny, how did it happen?

762
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,720
 She's like, I was doing handstands.

763
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,180
 I'm like, why would you do handstands

764
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,760
 with icing on your fingers?

765
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,440
 She's just like, looking down.

766
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
 I was like, is there anything you wanna say?

767
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
 She's like, will you please forgive me?

768
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,520
 I'm like, I'm like top notch jerk.

769
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,540
 This is like last week, PS.

770
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,280
 You're like, smoking's not your only problem.

771
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,280
 And so I'm like, yes, I forgive you, you're dismissed.

772
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,620
 I don't know, something terrible.

773
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,120
 She goes to her bedroom, time passes,

774
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,720
 and Laura's like, hey, that was probably a little harsh.

775
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,800
 I'm like, I don't think it was, look at our carpet.

776
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,120
 I'm down there scrubbing it.

777
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,520
 And then I walk in, I'm like, all right, Penny,

778
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,420
 time for bed.

779
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,560
 And I'm like, Penny, it's time for bed.

780
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,680
 And she's just sitting on the bed,

781
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,860
 like staring holes through my soul.

782
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,080
 And she goes, how come when you have an accident,

783
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,440
 you want us to treat you nice,

784
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,140
 but when I have an accident, you talk to me like that?

785
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:00,000
 From the mouth of babes, I was like,

786
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
 and here's the pro tip, in case you're like,

787
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,500
 those are not parenting pro tips.

788
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,560
 Here's the pro tip.

789
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,320
 I was like, you're right.

790
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,100
 You're right stops the fight.

791
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,400
 I said, you're right, you're so right, Penny.

792
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,200
 I'm so sorry, I treated you horribly.

793
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,320
 Would you please forgive me?

794
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,120
 I'm so sorry, dad should never talk to you that.

795
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,000
 And you're right when I have an accident,

796
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,400
 I don't wanna be treated that way, I'm so sorry.

797
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,760
 And her demeanor went from like, I'm gonna light you up

798
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,040
 to like smiling and like, okay, we can read a book now

799
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,300
 and go to bed.

800
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,320
 Like so good at forgiving,

801
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
 but it was all because I'm like, you're right.

802
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,560
 That's what we want, right?

803
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,840
 Like when you've hurt someone,

804
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,040
 what they're wanting is like, do you have any idea

805
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,280
 like the pain that you caused me?

806
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,960
 And if you start making excuses,

807
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,040
 like, well, the reason why I did it,

808
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,680
 and you know that I was late and traffic was hard,

809
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,760
 and do you know the pressure that I'm under at at work?

810
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,400
 And how come you never do your share of the bills

811
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,560
 and all the stuff?

812
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,400
 And what about you?

813
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,340
 I mean, you let us into temptation last week too.

814
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,480
 Like all that stuff, instead of you're like,

815
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,120
 you're right, you're so right, stops the fight.

816
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,960
 Own your part.

817
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,780
 So follow God, not your feelings.

818
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,620
 Own your part.

819
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,640
 You is moved from unrest to unity.

820
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,400
 If you have unrest in a relationship,

821
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,760
 or if there's any relationship where you're like,

822
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,000
 man, I hope I don't see them.

823
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,600
 If there's any relationship that you ghost them,

824
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,160
 or you see their call or ID pop up and you're like,

825
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,320
 whatever, like, no,

826
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,840
 can't believe you would even call me.

827
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,480
 Like, or you've deleted their number,

828
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,440
 it's showing up on Mark.

829
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,080
 If there's unrest in the relationship,

830
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,640
 God's command, not suggestion, not idea,

831
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,760
 not like, what if, or hey, that might be nice.

832
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,760
 His command is that we move from unrest to unity.

833
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,380
 Then we gospel the relationship.

834
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,100
 We were at unrest with God,

835
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,380
 and he pursued us to be unified through Jesus.

836
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,900
 And so he's like, hey, do the same thing.

837
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,120
 And so unification is the reason.

838
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,020
 It's always the reason for confrontation.

839
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,340
 Confrontation is not like to twist their knife,

840
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,500
 rub the nose in it, show them how they're wrong.

841
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,300
 They were, make them feel stupid,

842
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,020
 embarrass them in front of others.

843
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,180
 Unification is always the reason biblically

844
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,340
 for confrontation.

845
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,140
 You're going to them for the purpose

846
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,540
 that the relationship would be restored

847
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,720
 just as yours had been through Jesus Christ, your Lord.

848
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,520
 You're gonna gospel the relationship.

849
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,980
 Unification, moving from unrest to unity.

850
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,740
 In 2 Corinthians 2, verse 6 through 11,

851
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,960
 there was someone who would sin greatly,

852
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,060
 so greatly that there was church discipline.

853
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,780
 Paul's like, hey, with such a one, don't even share a meal.

854
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,140
 Turn them over to Satan for the destruction of their flesh.

855
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,540
 Well, the person repented.

856
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,940
 And so now Paul writes,

857
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,220
 "For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough.

858
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,300
 So you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him,

859
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,140
 or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow."

860
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,540
 Gospel the relationship.

861
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,460
 "So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him,

862
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,060
 not just like, hey, you're forgiven, but I love you.

863
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,180
 For this is why I wrote that I might test you

864
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,140
 and know whether you're obedient in everything,

865
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,780
 obedient in discipline, obedient in forgiveness.

866
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,980
 Anyone whom you forgive, I forgive also.

867
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,020
 Indeed, what I have forgiven,

868
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,300
 I have forgiven anything that has been for your sake

869
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,300
 in the presence of Christ."

870
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,540
 Listen, "So that," like, what's the purpose of this?

871
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,820
 All this forgiveness stuff.

872
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,280
 What are we after here?

873
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,740
 "So that we would not be outwitted by Satan,

874
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,100
 for we are not ignorant of his designs."

875
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,140
 Satan wants you to be unforgiving.

876
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,980
 It's his aim.

877
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,440
 That whole, like, don't let the sun go down on your anger,

878
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,100
 that whole, 'cause Satan will get a foothold.

879
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
 Here's what he's after.

880
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,900
 This person had been isolated from the body of Christ

881
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,620
 because of their sin.

882
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,620
 And sometimes we're like, yeah, good.

883
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,940
 They did what they did.

884
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,500
 And the Holy Spirit, as written through Paul, is like,

885
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,220
 "No, forgive them.

886
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,740
 Reaffirm your love for them,

887
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,800
 because we're not ignorant of Satan's designs,

888
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,540
 that we would be outwitted by him,

889
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,540
 where he wants to divide and separate and shame and shun

890
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,240
 and condemn and accuse."

891
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,720
 Those are his words, and those are his actions.

892
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,580
 But instead, "That we would move from unrest to unity

893
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,300
 and pursue towards that person with forgiveness and love."

894
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,340
 And I think about, like, the most difficult time

895
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,700
 in my life, the hardest thing that's ever been done to me.

896
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,940
 I mentioned it in a message a couple of weeks ago,

897
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,420
 is when I found out that the person I was with

898
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,260
 was sleeping with one of my friends.

899
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,900
 And the, like, the betrayal by both of them,

900
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,900
 the hurt, the pain, like I wanted to kill.

901
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,280
 But what happened was, like, and this didn't take long,

902
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,180
 the hatred in my heart was literally unraveling me.

903
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,860
 Like the black, dark hatred, where I'm like,

904
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:07,620
 I want my friend dead, and I want revenge on her.

905
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,620
 It was eating me alive all day, every day, ad nauseum.

906
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,500
 To the point, and I wasn't even a believer yet,

907
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,060
 I literally pick up the phone to my friend, I'm like,

908
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,180
 "Hey," he wouldn't take my calls anymore, shocker,

909
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,580
 I told him I wanted to kill him.

910
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,840
 So I got his voicemail, and I was like,

911
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,240
 "Hey, I said some horrible things to you,

912
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,220
 and will you please forgive me?"

913
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,380
 And I think he's probably like, "Me forgive you?"

914
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,620
 He never called back.

915
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,360
 And then I called the girl.

916
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,740
 I'm like, "Hey, it must've been miserable

917
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,020
 being with an alcoholic.

918
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,520
 Like, I don't have a category for that.

919
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,700
 Will you please forgive me for everything

920
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,660
 that I brought into our relationship?"

921
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,360
 Because we were at unrest, and it was killing me,

922
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,620
 it was killing the relationships.

923
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,820
 And so it was my attempt to move towards unity.

924
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,900
 So you don't talk about them, instead you go to them.

925
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,180
 Matthew 18, verses 15 through 17, it says,

926
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,940
 "If your brother or sister sins against you,

927
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,860
 go," there it is again, like the Proverbs,

928
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,860
 "Go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone."

929
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,660
 Now it says, "Tell him his fault,

930
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,860
 and I want to remind you to love your neighbors yourself."

931
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,380
 So when you tell him his fault, you need to be mindful

932
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,740
 of how would I like my fault to be told to me?

933
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,680
 Between you and him alone.

934
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,540
 If he listens to you, you've gained your brother,

935
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,500
 but if he doesn't listen,

936
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,540
 take one or two others along with you.

937
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,580
 This is not to like gang up on someone, to dogpile them,

938
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,820
 to like come at them, but rather like,

939
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,260
 "Hey, these are others from your sphere of influence.

940
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
 We're gonna come to you out of love,

941
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,060
 'cause we're concerned, we're at unrest.

942
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,180
 We need to move towards unity."

943
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,700
 And a lot of us, like there's a spectrum of truth and grace.

944
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,900
 It said Jesus was full of truth and grace.

945
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,500
 So there's people who are like, "Man, I am uber truthful.

946
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,300
 Like I call a spade a spade, I call it, I say what is,

947
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,180
 like that's just true, and I'm gonna let you know."

948
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,820
 And then there's others that are like,

949
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,580
 "Man, that's like harsh to me.

950
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,160
 Like you are always gonna know that I love you.

951
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,300
 Like there's just love that flows from you,

952
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,260
 and you get that part."

953
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,300
 So all the truth tellers in the room,

954
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,060
 raise your hands, where are you at?

955
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,540
 Yup, yup, some people just like scooched over,

956
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,740
 like, "That's nice, I didn't know that."

957
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,460
 And where's the love people?

958
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,300
 Yeah, yeah, okay, good.

959
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,760
 So hey, you're both wrong.

960
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,820
 Welcome, I'll be your motivational speaker for the night.

961
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,900
 Jesus was full of truth and grace.

962
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,220
 So in 1 Corinthians 13,

963
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,780
 like quintessential chapter about love,

964
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,540
 he's like, "If you've got truth, but you don't have love,

965
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,060
 you're a nuisance."

966
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,260
 But the reverse is true, that if you've got love,

967
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,880
 but you don't have truth, you're negligent.

968
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:06,280
 And so the truth is from God is to marry the two,

969
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,780
 that you would have truth and grace.

970
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,700
 So you do, you go to your brother, you show the fault,

971
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,140
 but it's always in love, from unrest to unity.

972
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,560
 So you've got follow God, not your feelings,

973
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,220
 own your part, moving from unrest to unity,

974
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,780
 and the acrostic foul, and then the last one is,

975
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,460
 love like God, love like God.

976
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:32,740
 Ephesians 4, 32 through 5, it says this,

977
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,100
 "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,

978
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,580
 forgiving one another."

979
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,020
 Here it is, gospeling your relationships.

980
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,500
 "As God in Christ forgave you,

981
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,980
 therefore," in case you missed it,

982
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,980
 he says it again, "Be imitators of God as beloved children."

983
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,140
 That's where he says to gospel your relationship,

984
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,780
 explicitly, he says, "Forgive one another

985
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,860
 as God in Christ forgave you."

986
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,700
 And as if it wasn't enough, he's like, "Imitate me."

987
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,540
 Like, how did I do that for you?

988
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,300
 Did I make you pay penance?

989
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,580
 Did I tell you like, "I'll forgive you,

990
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,180
 come back in 10 years, clean up your act first,

991
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,820
 quit smoking, quit the weed, quit vaping,

992
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,740
 quit with the alcohol,

993
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,140
 sleeping with your boyfriend and girlfriend,

994
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,740
 the porn addiction, all the unforgiveness in your heart,

995
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,060
 get all that right, then come to me."

996
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,300
 No, no, he's like, "You wanna be forgiven?

997
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,740
 That's why I sent my son today, the day of salvation.

998
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,340
 You believe, you confess Jesus as Lord,

999
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,300
 believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,

1000
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,020
 you're safe, period, end of story, today."

1001
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,580
 That's what God does, he's like, "Imitate me,

1002
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,260
 imitate me, reflect me to this dying world

1003
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,260
 like they are dying and going to hell forever.

1004
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,500
 So I need you to imitate me,

1005
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
 and the way that I want you to imitate me

1006
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,500
 is to be kind and tenderhearted and forgiving

1007
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,660
 as God the Father in Christ forgave you.

1008
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,740
 We love like God.

1009
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:17,720
 On February 3rd, this is recent, what, 25 days ago,

1010
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,700
 in Germany, they just found a bomb,

1011
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,500
 550 pound bomb on the rail line

1012
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,420
 that goes from Switzerland into Germany,

1013
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,180
 one of the most traveled routes,

1014
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,880
 north-south connecting the two countries.

1015
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,020
 And they know, they discovered by identifying it,

1016
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,520
 who is responsible for it.

1017
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,060
 So any guess who put the bomb there?

1018
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,540
 I heard Russia.

1019
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,540
 Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Al-Shabaab,

1020
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,900
 like there's so many terror groups.

1021
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,220
 Who would put that, who wants to blow apart

1022
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,860
 civilian train full of people?

1023
00:43:54,860 --> 00:44:00,420
 Oops, it's our bomb.

1024
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,140
 It's our bomb, it's the United States,

1025
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,020
 it's the Allied Forces bomb

1026
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,560
 that they just happened to discover just now.

1027
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,260
 It's our bomb from World War II.

1028
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,460
 Happens all the time in Germany.

1029
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,140
 And the reason why it's still there

1030
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,780
 is because Germany got decimated.

1031
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
 Like once the tide turned on World War II,

1032
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,980
 we were just dropping ordinance all over Germany

1033
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,000
 to bomb them into surrender.

1034
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,180
 And what Germany did is they just clamored

1035
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,180
 to rebuild Germany after it had been decimated

1036
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,620
 in World War II, and they literally built

1037
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,500
 their country upon bombs.

1038
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,340
 They're finding them all over the place.

1039
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,900
 Every time they do construction, they find bombs.

1040
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,380
 Water levels go down on rivers in the summertime,

1041
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,340
 they find bombs.

1042
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,540
 They have rebuilt their country on top of bombs,

1043
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,940
 and so have we.

1044
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,660
 Because bombs don't go away, bombs go off.

1045
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,180
 And we're like, ah, that was a long time ago.

1046
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,900
 I probably don't need to go ask their forgiveness.

1047
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,260
 They probably forgotten about it anyway.

1048
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,980
 Or man, that was a long time ago,

1049
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,100
 I just shouldn't even bring it up again.

1050
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,540
 That'd be super awkward.

1051
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,220
 Well, bombs don't go away, bombs go off.

1052
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,140
 And so we've got to unearth those things.

1053
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,420
 What they do, they call in an expert,

1054
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,660
 a demolition expert who knows how to dismantle the bomb,

1055
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,900
 and so must we.

1056
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,300
 When we love like God, it's not like, okay, God,

1057
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,340
 like I'll just forgive them by my own strength.

1058
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,640
 If you would, you wouldn't have need this lesson tonight.

1059
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,700
 There are people that have done things in my life

1060
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,040
 where I'm like, God, I forgive them.

1061
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,060
 And you know what, the very next day, I don't forgive them.

1062
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,780
 I'm like, dude, I can't believe it.

1063
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,140
 Honestly, like that's unbelievable.

1064
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,540
 Root of bitterness starts to grow up.

1065
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,900
 I'm like, oh, it's a dash light on my soul.

1066
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,580
 Like, okay, God, again, I'm giving this to you.

1067
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,900
 Lord, I forgive them.

1068
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,140
 I'm taking that bomb to the only one

1069
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,540
 who can take care of it before it blows me apart

1070
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,140
 and the relationship and be like,

1071
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,380
 okay, I'm bringing this to you again.

1072
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,220
 Like it came up again, Satan reminded me,

1073
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,220
 my flesh, my ego, like whatever it is, it's back again.

1074
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,780
 So I've got to bring this back to you

1075
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,580
 because the feelings are gonna come back,

1076
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,680
 but we're not following feelings.

1077
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,860
 We're gonna love like God,

1078
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,100
 and we're gonna let God dismantle all that stuff.

1079
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,980
 So here's two things.

1080
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,420
 One, you're like, well, how can I forgive

1081
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,060
 what was done to me?

1082
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,660
 If they're a believer, if the person has trusted in Jesus

1083
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,820
 for the forgiveness of sins, all of their sin,

1084
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,600
 Colossians 2 says has been nailed to the cross.

1085
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,040
 Jesus, Jesus, God in flesh forgave their sin.

1086
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,220
 So who are you to be like, man, I know you did

1087
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,500
 and you forgive mine, but nah, I'm not.

1088
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,140
 That's exponentially crazier than smoking in church.

1089
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,980
 The audacity that we would not forgive

1090
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,600
 what Jesus forgave at the cross.

1091
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,220
 But others, you might be like, no,

1092
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,180
 the person's not a believer.

1093
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,300
 The person that sexually abused me like monster.

1094
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,720
 And no, they are not a follower of Christ.

1095
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,940
 In Romans chapter 12, it says, do not take revenge.

1096
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,420
 You're like, great, doormat, no.

1097
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,980
 God says it's mine to avenge.

1098
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,460
 He's gonna deal with it.

1099
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,580
 He's gonna deal with their sin,

1100
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,880
 either at the cross if that person trusts in Jesus

1101
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,780
 or forever in eternity in hell.

1102
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,600
 But their sin will be dealt with.

1103
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,740
 And that should move us as Jesus says,

1104
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,220
 pray for your enemies because you don't want,

1105
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,220
 I mean, anybody to spend eternity in hell.

1106
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,420
 That is the most terrifying thought.

1107
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,360
 And so you pray for your enemy,

1108
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,420
 knowing that to love like God,

1109
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,440
 even as Jesus was on the cross, father, forgive them.

1110
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,780
 They were crucifying him.

1111
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,980
 And in the moment when he could have said anything,

1112
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,300
 it's like, forgive them.

1113
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,140
 They know not what they do.

1114
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,140
 They have no idea the gravity of what they're doing.

1115
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,360
 Praying for his enemies from the cross as they killed him.

1116
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,380
 And we're to love like God, love like God.

1117
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,660
 So if there's a foul, follow God, not your feelings,

1118
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,820
 own your part, unrest to unity and love like God.

1119
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,740
 You remember the cigarettes and I'm gonna crush these

1120
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,520
 so that nobody picks them up afterwards.

1121
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,400
 I was in Switzerland and it gotten high.

1122
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,600
 This was, I don't know, 20 years ago.

1123
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,860
 Gotten high, I was literally like walking through,

1124
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,060
 this is before weed was legal in parts of America.

1125
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:40,540
 I'm walking through a field, like a farm of weed

1126
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,220
 and gotten high there with people from,

1127
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,740
 I don't know where as I was backpacking,

1128
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,460
 same trip as the hungry thing.

1129
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,460
 No, a different one actually.

1130
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,460
 Anyway, I mean, it's just there for the taking and cheap.

1131
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,460
 But I literally was like, I can't take any back with me.

1132
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,380
 And it's not because I had some like moral conscience,

1133
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,220
 like, I don't know, that'd be, I mean,

1134
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,720
 I had no conscience at that point in time, I wanted to.

1135
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,900
 The reason why is because there was US customs.

1136
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,820
 I knew that I would get to US customs

1137
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,340
 with drug sniffing dogs and that land that I was headed to

1138
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,140
 is like, no, you don't bring that in here.

1139
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,260
 We don't bring that in here into this land.

1140
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,160
 And now if you've trusted in Jesus,

1141
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,300
 you have stepped into the kingdom of God

1142
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,500
 and customs in his word, his custom is like,

1143
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,180
 no, you don't bring unforgiveness here.

1144
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,020
 It's like, that is so opposite of the gospel.

1145
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,460
 You don't bring that here.

1146
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,220
 And I'm gonna check you as you go through this scam,

1147
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,100
 the Holy Spirit, like we're gonna look at your soul

1148
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,180
 and I'm gonna convict you like,

1149
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,900
 hey, you've got unforgiveness there.

1150
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,800
 It's killing you, destroying your own relationships.

1151
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,300
 Like you've got to deal with that.

1152
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,360
 We don't bring that into this land.

1153
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,360
 So that you can be free, free, free.

1154
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,680
 That they would be free.

1155
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,680
 That we would love like God and gospel our relationships.

1156
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,780
 Let me pray.

1157
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,980
 Father, there are literally no words.

1158
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,760
 We will sing for all eternity

1159
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,160
 of your forgiveness through Jesus.

1160
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,960
 (soft music)

1161
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,720
 And may we now become the most forgiving people.

1162
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,600
 Forgiving others who have sinned against us

1163
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,780
 and asking for forgiveness for those

1164
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,680
 that we have sinned against.

1165
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,560
 I pray there'd be a movement by the people

1166
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,160
 who are hearing your word tonight.

1167
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,960
 And that we would never be as audacious

1168
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:46,120
 to bring that illegal substance of unforgiveness,

1169
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,400
 that cancerous unforgiveness into your kingdom.

1170
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,580
 It's got no place.

1171
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,880
 Thank you for forgiving us.

1172
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,240
 Now move in our life to forgive and seek forgiveness.

1173
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,720
 That there would be unity.

1174
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,080
 We love you, we now sing to you.

1175
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,780
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1176
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,800
 Y'all, please now stand and sing to the one

1177
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,420
 who forgave all of your sins.

1178
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,760
 (whooshing)
