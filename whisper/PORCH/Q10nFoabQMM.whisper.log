[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:24.480]   - Let's go, let's go!
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.940]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.320]   Hey, it is good to be back,
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.160]   speaking at the porch with all of you.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.400]   You guys are my favorite.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.120]   I'm so excited to be here.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.080]   Hey, I wanna give a quick shout out to our friends,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.840]   our live locations, tuning in online.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.160]   We have Porch Houston, Porch Sweetwater,
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.300]   Porch Missouri City, and Porch Cedar Rapids.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.760]   And of course, a big hello to my friends in the room
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.280]   tonight here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.620]   So, hey, if we haven't met, my name is JD,
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.040]   and I am so excited.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.400]   We're gonna get right in because I got 30 minutes.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.800]   I got in trouble last time for going too long,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.000]   so we're gonna stick to 30 minutes.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.440]   So here we go.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.840]   Sophomore year of high school, there I am, my brother,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.400]   my little brother, who you need to know
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.600]   is a lot bigger than me.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.080]   A lot of things happened, and the point is,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.600]   a very brother-on-brother situation happened
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.180]   where I had the remote, he wanted the remote,
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.040]   he's here tonight, he wanted the remote,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.600]   and he came over to me with his manly self,
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   and at this point, I'm like this tall,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.400]   and he walks over and says, "Give me the remote."
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.880]   And I'm like, "No."
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.320]   And he's like, "Give me the remote."
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.340]   And he starts to do that thing
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.080]   where you start to bend back someone's finger,
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.160]   and I'm like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh."
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.760]   And he's like, "Let go of the remote."
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.740]   And I look at him, and I say,
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.160]   "You are not gonna get this remote
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.800]   "unless you don't have to break my finger.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   "If you want this remote, you're gonna break my finger."
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.680]   And he looks down at me, right in the eye,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.440]   and he just goes, (imitates gun firing)
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.360]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.580]   And I pull away, and I'm like,
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.320]   "Oh, take your stupid remote."
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.880]   And I throw it, and I walk in my room,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.680]   and I look down, and I could not believe it.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.080]   My finger is facing this way.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   He literally broke my finger.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   And I walk in, and I'm like, "Oh, my God."
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.760]   He's like, "Ah!"
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.720]   We're like, "Ah!"
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   And I run into my mom, and we're like, "Ah!"
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.600]   And she's like, "Oh, ah!"
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.280]   We all just, she's like, "Get in the car.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.120]   "Get in the car."
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.000]   My brother's like, "Can I come?"
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.400]   And she's like, "No, you've done enough."
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.000]   And we get in the car, and we get to the hospital,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.160]   and I'm thinking I'm gonna walk out of there
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.440]   with one of these guys.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.820]   Everyone ever had those finger splint things?
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.240]   Because of the nature of the break,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.360]   I had a cast to my elbow.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720]   Imagine walking to high school,
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   into high school the next day,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.560]   and all your friends are like, "What'd you do?
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.640]   "How'd you break your arm?"
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.840]   And I'm like, "My little brother
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.240]   "literally broke my finger with his man hands."
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.160]   That's what I had to tell people,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.580]   and it was embarrassing, humiliating.
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.400]   And I had to walk around with a big old cast for six weeks.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   And six weeks came, and the doctor said,
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   "Hey, now you have to do the hard part."
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.840]   That was the easy part.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.600]   "Now you have to do physical therapy.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.760]   "And if anyone's had physical therapy, no one likes it.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.320]   "Especially when it's your little finger.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.640]   "One and two and one and."
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.840]   It's just not fun, and it's painful.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.180]   And so what did I do?
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.560]   I was a drummer, I liked volleyball, I was very active,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.280]   and so I wanted to get back in the game as soon as I could,
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.960]   so I would just pop the pain meds,
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.680]   deal with the little bit of temporary pain,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.840]   get back in the game.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.000]   And I never really actually did physical therapy,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.920]   and because of that, my finger can't function
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.760]   how it's supposed to.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.940]   I literally cannot bend it in.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.880]   There is too much cartilage built up
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.720]   because I did not do physical therapy.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.960]   This is how it's supposed to be.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.280]   This is how it is.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.440]   My finger will never ever be able to fully function
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.000]   the way that it was intended to,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.880]   because I was not willing to put in the work for a season,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.040]   although painful, I wasn't willing to do it.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.860]   I just ignored it.
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.960]   I didn't address it, and now my finger won't bend.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.640]   And I start there because in a lot of the same ways,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.380]   you and I know that we're broken.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.900]   We know that we're messed up.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.720]   We know there are things that have happened in our life
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.620]   that require maybe a spiritual therapy,
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.540]   that require us to step into a season
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.980]   of maybe short, temporary pain, because let's be real,
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.780]   it's hard to address really broken things,
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.460]   and instead of using our decade of decisions
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.600]   to decide to actually deal with these things,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.340]   we actually turn to numbing and coping mechanisms,
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.500]   and that's what I wanna talk about tonight.
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.300]   I wanna talk about tonight how you need to make sure
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.300]   that this next decade is defined by you taking the time
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.180]   to experience spiritual therapy now, not later,
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.780]   because that is what your young adult year
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.080]   should build upon, is you taking the time to get healthy,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.260]   to get healed, and to get free.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.300]   But so many of us waste our young adult years,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.900]   and we turn to things to numb the pain
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.660]   and to cope with things, to get through a season,
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.660]   and we walk and we limp the rest of our life
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.020]   because we never dealt with our pain.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.220]   We never dealt with it.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.060]   And so I'm gonna talk about tonight God's plan,
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.840]   because so many of us are walking around,
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.300]   dealing with things like depression, fear and anxiety,
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.140]   insecurity, guilt and shame, disappointment, loneliness,
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.740]   all of these things make us so broken
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.080]   and leave us with so many questions,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.200]   because the world we live in is broken.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.260]   Can we just be real for a moment and acknowledge
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.160]   that we live in a very messed up time?
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.740]   The world is crazy.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.260]   I don't even know anything about politics
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.040]   to know that the world is crazy, okay?
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.180]   You can see it everywhere.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.100]   And what I have come to realize though,
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.700]   is that because being a young adult,
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.220]   no one really gives you a manual.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.860]   Like college needs to work on teaching you actual things
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.820]   that are applicable to life.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.800]   Can I get an amen?
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.300]   Like you get done, like you get the piece of paper
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.700]   and you get chunked into society,
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.820]   like a little, like the world is savage
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.020]   and you just get chunked out there with no manual.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.740]   And they just expect you to know how to do things,
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.080]   how to pay for taxes, how to get your debt covered
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.300]   and to defend for yourself.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.420]   It's a lonely, lonely place.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.420]   And because of that, we search to find any kind of escape
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.260]   through avenues like numbing and coping mechanisms.
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.100]   So that's what we're talking about tonight.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.520]   Tonight, I wanna talk about how we can stop numbing
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.440]   and start healing.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.020]   That we can use our roaring 20s,
[00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.140]   that we can use this decade
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.240]   as we're deciding to do so many things
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.480]   to make the time to put in the necessary work,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.400]   although painful for a short season to actually heal
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.720]   so we can function how God always intended
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.440]   for you and I to function.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.480]   He did not intend for us to walk around with a limp
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.680]   and live life partial.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.300]   He meant for life to be full.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.280]   And God has something to say about how we're meant to live
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.020]   and how we're meant to heal.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.120]   And so just a quick preview,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.040]   tonight we're talking about three steps
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.920]   to stop numbing and start healing.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.840]   Three steps to stop numbing and start healing.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.680]   I want you to remember these.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.960]   I made them really easy for the note takers in the room.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   Three A's, A, A, A, admit, allow, address.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.600]   Admit, allow, address.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.480]   Say it with me.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.340]   Admit, allow, address.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.080]   Because what you don't want to happen is
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.160]   you don't wanna keep turning to coping
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.440]   because one day you're gonna wake up
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   and realize that it's too late.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.080]   You're now that weird 40 year old man at the bar
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.240]   by himself reminiscing on the glory days
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.620]   with guys who don't care.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.280]   You don't wanna be that mom
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.320]   that is wearing inappropriate clothes
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.080]   and it's like, you're like, oh, please cover that up
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.060]   because she's trying to get some attraction
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.900]   from younger guys.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.040]   You just don't wanna be that person.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.560]   And those people became those people
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.880]   because they never dealt with their pain
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.000]   in their young adult years.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.320]   You don't want that to be your story.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.600]   And God has a better story for us.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.660]   So let's talk about it.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.960]   The first step and how to stop numbing and start healing
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.800]   is to admit that you're numbing.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.940]   Admit that you're numbing.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.560]   It's not really rocket science.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.600]   A lot of us, we have not been able to find a way
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.760]   to stop numbing is because we haven't even admitted
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   to ourselves that, hey, I think I'm numbing.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.280]   And I don't wanna assume that everyone here
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.360]   knows what I mean when I say numbing or coping.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.920]   So here's just some examples really quick.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.780]   You might be numbing or coping
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.320]   if you can't wait to get home from work
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.840]   to drink that glass of wine every single day.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.440]   Your credit cards are maxed out
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.120]   and somehow you're still managing
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.560]   to buy that drink every single weekend.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.960]   You work out again and again and again,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.580]   and you're so anal about everything you eat
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.360]   because you think, man, if I just looked like so-and-so.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.840]   Just a quick list of other things.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.480]   You might be buying things that you know you don't need.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.000]   You might be actually going through cutting.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.860]   People literally, I mean, I know
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.680]   that you can get to such a place that you're like,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.920]   I just wanna feel something.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.640]   So you resort to self-harm.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.320]   And I don't mean for this to be light.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.320]   I don't mean for this to be just a quick thing on a list.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.000]   This is serious stuff that we're talking about.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.200]   And there's a way out of these things.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.160]   You might be numbing with pornography,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.280]   popping constantly Xanax, Adderall,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.080]   hitting a quick blunt every morning,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.840]   eating disorders, Instagram,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.520]   getting drunk and living for the weekend,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.040]   having sex, zoning out.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.600]   Literally, like if your life has zero silence in it,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.880]   if you can't stand being alone,
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.680]   so every time you're alone at a red light,
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.880]   at a stop sign even, you're just checking your phone
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.560]   or you're playing video games for hours,
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.680]   anything to allow you to zone out, that is numbing.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.520]   That is coping because you're not wanting to face reality.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.180]   And so some of you, to be able to admit that you're numbing,
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.020]   you first have to come to grips
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.880]   with understanding what numbing is.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.360]   And then if you do anything kind of in this wheelhouse,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.440]   anything that you look to as an escape to avoid reality,
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.920]   you're numbing.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.160]   Others of you are like, yeah,
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.920]   I know this stuff isn't good for me.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.000]   I know this stuff isn't what I'm supposed to be doing,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.160]   especially if I call myself a Christian.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.720]   I know these things aren't right,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   but my pride will not let me admit that I'm numbing
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.080]   or that I'm coping.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.960]   Here's why.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.440]   You don't wanna admit that you're numbing
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.240]   because you know that that actually means
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.240]   that you will have to admit that something is wrong
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.840]   because no one just numbs for the sake of numbing.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.160]   If you don't wanna admit that you're numbing or like,
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.600]   yeah, I know these things aren't good for me,
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.720]   but I'm not gonna admit it.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.900]   I'm good, I'm just having fun.
[00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.640]   Or this is just what you do when you're young.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.700]   Like if you're so afraid to admit it,
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.400]   it's because you're so afraid to admit that you're weak
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.900]   and that you have a need.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.200]   You would rather, actually we would rather,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.880]   as a generation laugh about these things.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.480]   Literally, I was just looking up all the things
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.760]   about numbing and coping
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.640]   and what something actually triggered in my mind
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.320]   was these really popular memes
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320]   that people kind of made around this topic.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.880]   So this first one, therapists, remember these?
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.560]   And what do we say when we feel like this?
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.880]   More espresso, less depresso.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.980]   Therapists, no.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.800]   Next one.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.840]   What's your unhealthiest coping mechanism?
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.560]   Listening to depressing songs when I'm depressed
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.640]   to increase my depression.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.080]   Anyone been there before?
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.960]   You're like, I don't know why I'm listening to this.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.800]   I don't know why I'm doing it.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.640]   I know I shouldn't.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.320]   And it's like, we just do it.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.720]   The next one.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.960]   Therapists, and what do we do when we feel like this?
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.040]   Redownload Tinder to feel validated by strangers.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.000]   No, no, this explains a lot.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.940]   We are not, this isn't new information to most of us.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.120]   We know it so well.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.840]   We know that we do these things.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.720]   We are so aware of it that we literally make memes about it.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.120]   We literally are like, yep, this is me.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.780]   I mean, I know coping mechanisms.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.620]   I'm the guy, I mean, that's just me.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.000]   And I would say to you, although we can laugh
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.480]   and although we can joke, how long?
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.120]   Like how long are we gonna laugh at the fact
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.080]   that there are people in our generation,
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.400]   there are people our age who are coping
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.840]   because they're searching.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.240]   And wisdom would say that you can laugh
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.000]   and you can reject and you can dismiss the idea
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.400]   that you're numbing and you can be prideful
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.480]   all you want, but it will only lead you to more hurt.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.160]   Proverbs 16, 18 says, "Pride goes before destruction
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.060]   "and a haughty or arrogant spirit before a fall."
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.960]   Pride comes before the fall.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.180]   Literally, if you keep this up,
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.600]   it'll only last you for so long.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.760]   If you're someone that's going, that's not me, man.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.040]   Like you don't know me, you don't know why I do
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.440]   the things I do, you just need to chill out.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.040]   I would say really check yourself
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.480]   because I would say that it looks like you're going
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   down a path that leads to destruction.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.920]   It's only gonna end up bad for you.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.480]   And the thing about being a Christ follower,
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.580]   that's so cool about being a son and daughter
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.080]   that I've come to realize is I used to like be this guy
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.400]   that didn't wanna admit that I was actually
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.240]   dealing with things.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.040]   And so when I started to read the Bible,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.280]   I started to see that Paul actually tells us
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.620]   in 2 Corinthians 12, nine, he says,
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.320]   "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.560]   So that's what God says to us.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.120]   "My grace is sufficient for you,
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.880]   for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.000]   Therefore, we can boast all the more gladly
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.440]   in our weaknesses so that the power of Christ
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.800]   may rest upon us."
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.320]   Here's what Paul is saying there.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.700]   Your weakness needs to be on full display
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.160]   because when you're weak, that's when the world gets to see
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.840]   just how strong he is.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.280]   And so the best thing you can do is quit trying
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.180]   to put up this image that I'm all good.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.840]   I'm not numbing, I just like to have fun.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.920]   It's just the things that I do.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.520]   No, I'm weak.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.660]   I have a problem and I need Jesus.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.300]   So for some of us, the most courageous thing we can do,
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.280]   listen, the most courageous practical next step
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   that you can take is to go and be alone as soon as you can
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.080]   or look yourself in a mirror or get in your car
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.200]   and put your hands on the driver's, the steering wheel
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.420]   and say to yourself, things that you have suppressed
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.740]   and denied for so long that you know are there.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.400]   Some of you might need to say things like,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.320]   I don't like myself.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.640]   I really just actually struggle with self-loathing
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.160]   and I don't like what I see when I look in the mirror.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.680]   Some of you need to say, I blame God that I'm still single.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.720]   Some of you should say, I think my dad will genuinely
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.280]   never be proud of me and give me that attaboy
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.520]   like I've craved for my whole life
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.420]   until I'm actually really successful.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.460]   Or maybe it's, I don't actually know where I'm going
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.300]   when I die.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.740]   If I were to get in a car wreck on the way home,
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.040]   there's something that keeps playing in the back of my mind
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.540]   that I don't know what's next, therefore I escape
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.300]   because I don't wanna think about that, that scares me.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.380]   And so step one is admit that you're numbing
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.260]   because that is the first step to admit
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.720]   that there is a deeper problem going on, that you're weak.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.340]   But when you start to do this, I don't want you to think
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.820]   that, oh, I admitted it, it's out there,
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.980]   things are gonna get easier.
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.860]   I would actually argue, now it gets harder
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.700]   for a little bit.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.140]   It's actually gonna get tougher when you start
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.240]   to admit these things because these are feelings
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.860]   and thoughts and lies that you've suppressed for so long.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.460]   And when you begin to speak them and say them,
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.380]   you start to have all these feelings and emotions,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.300]   especially for you men that aren't used to expressing
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.420]   feelings and emotions.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.940]   Obviously I'm a very hyper emotional guy more than most,
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.660]   but when you do it, it starts to come out of you,
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.540]   rush out of you and you start to feel things
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.500]   you never felt before and you start to go,
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.020]   wait, this is really hard.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.700]   I don't know what to do with all this.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.780]   And you begin to go, what do I do?
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.080]   I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.340]   which then leads to the perfect setup for step two.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.200]   Step two is allow others in.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.400]   Allow others in.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.060]   God never intended for us to do this life alone.
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.700]   He never wanted you to deal with these things in isolation.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.020]   He saw from the very beginning that it was not good
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.300]   for man to be alone.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.140]   So what did he do?
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.980]   He gave him woman.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.420]   God made us in his image.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.420]   He is three in one.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.640]   He literally exists in togetherness.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.460]   You and I, we crave and we desire to be known
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.080]   and to be with other people.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.340]   So stop trying to carry these things alone.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.220]   Stop trying to do life alone.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.260]   It's so much better when you do life together with people.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.820]   And here's why.
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.420]   You're searching for healing.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.940]   You're searching to get away from these problems
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.780]   that you're running from.
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.020]   You're searching for true freedom.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.340]   Here's what I've come to find
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.580]   in the past like eight months.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.020]   What I've come to find is healing requires revealing.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:20.600]   Healing requires revealing.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.440]   Why?
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.260]   I'll tell you why.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.140]   Literally, God says so.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.420]   James 5, 16, "Confess your sins to one another."
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.260]   Why?
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.700]   "So that you may be healed."
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.220]   We're all looking for prescriptions and medications
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.060]   and drugs and alcohol and anything,
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.780]   girls, relationships, marriage, kids, success,
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.620]   so many things to provide healing and freedom
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.780]   from all the things we're running from.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.860]   And he's saying right here,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.860]   "Confess your sins to one another."
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.680]   Why?
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.020]   "So that you may be healed."
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.860]   Allowing others in when these things
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.500]   that you've admitted are surfacing
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.980]   allows you to share that burden
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.580]   and God has built up people to carry it with you.
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.960]   Proverbs 18, one says,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.580]   "Whoever isolates himself, seeks his own desires,
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.260]   "he breaks out against all sound judgment."
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.560]   Proverbs 28, 13 says,
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.140]   "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.060]   "but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.940]   So if scripture is constantly pointing us
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.520]   to allowing other people in, why do we forsake it?
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.940]   Why are we so quick to withdraw and be like,
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.480]   "No, I got this, I got this, look, I got this, I'm fine."
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.460]   Everyone see, on Instagram, look at me, I'm fine.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.420]   Like we do all these things
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.180]   to make the world convinced that we're fine
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.740]   and we know we're not.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.860]   Why is that?
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.300]   Maybe it's 'cause we're embarrassed.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.880]   Maybe it's 'cause we think I'm too much, this is too much.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.080]   Like, man, I'm too far into this friendship
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.620]   and if I start to just randomly start to like,
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.160]   let out all these feelings and like my past,
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.500]   they're gonna run.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.660]   I don't wanna be alone.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:51.200]   Maybe you think like, man, if I tell them,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.400]   it'll change everything they think about me.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.060]   And I would just tell you from personal experience,
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.020]   that's not true.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:01.060]   What you wanna look for is people
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.700]   that when you start to tell them your stuff,
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.380]   they will actually lean in, not run away, not pull back.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.620]   And here's what they're gonna be able to help you to do.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.980]   They're gonna be able to help you separate truth from lies.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.920]   They're gonna be able to help you decide next steps
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.780]   and plans for actions and not only just help you decide it,
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.340]   but keep you accountable to it.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.380]   They're gonna be able to put healthy parameters
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.060]   and boundaries in your life to say,
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.820]   hey, I don't think that's a good idea.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.100]   Hey, I don't think that relationship is best for you.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.060]   I don't think you drinking this much is God's best for you.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.340]   But ultimately, they're gonna just be able to love you.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.020]   That is the best feeling of looking someone in the eye,
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.100]   getting down to level and saying,
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.460]   hey, here's everything, everything I've done.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.220]   The worst thing about me that I have concealed for so long,
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.560]   here it is.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.540]   And they look at you right back in the eye and lean in
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.120]   and say, thank you, I love you.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.780]   There's no better feeling than that
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.500]   because I think ultimately it's what we crave
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.160]   because that is what the Father does for us.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.000]   So that's the benefit of allowing others in.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.400]   When I got to Watermark back in July,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.740]   it was the first time I really experienced
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.580]   something like this.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.180]   I had kind of thought, okay,
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.140]   just confess your sins to one another.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.100]   So like one person knows my stuff, I'm good.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.180]   And I actually started to see what it looks like
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.660]   to walk in freedom and walk in the light in this place.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.940]   I was shook.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.380]   I was getting here and leaders were getting up on this stage.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.100]   Women were getting on this stage,
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.980]   looking at this room full of people saying,
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.260]   I struggle with masturbation.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.100]   And I was like.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.020]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.380]   Did she just in front of, you know?
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.780]   And then like guys would get up and be like,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.020]   yeah, I'm on staff here
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.420]   and I struggle with same sex attraction.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.180]   I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.440]   he just put that out there for everyone to hear.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.640]   How can he do that?
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.820]   And I started to wrestle and go,
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.740]   why can't I walk like that?
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.780]   And I started to actually go,
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.860]   okay, I think maybe I can do this
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.740]   'cause look, all they have around them is love,
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.300]   fully known, fully loved.
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.220]   And I started to confess and say things
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.300]   in front of groups of people.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.060]   I started to confess a past of sexual sin and addiction
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.900]   that I have kept covered up for so long
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.260]   and I've experienced freedom
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:15.780]   and what it looks like to walk in the light.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.580]   And it's the best decision I've ever made.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.680]   And so whatever you're concealing,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.860]   you will never find healing until you start revealing.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.940]   So just start revealing it,
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.380]   start allowing others in.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.880]   And the last thing I'll say is,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.980]   a lot of us do not want to address step one.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.780]   Like we don't want to admit that there's a problem.
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.180]   We don't want to allow others in
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.220]   because we know what that means for us.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.300]   We know that that means
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.500]   that they're gonna actually lean in more and more
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.420]   and they're gonna make us do step three,
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.500]   which is address the roots.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.620]   And some of you maybe have heard this language before
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.140]   and you're already like, uh-oh,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.020]   'cause this is not fun.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.540]   Like this is the source of all the problems.
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.820]   This is why we cope.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.180]   This is why we numb.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.480]   This is why we run to different things.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.860]   This is why you run away
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.300]   and try to get that moment of escape
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.300]   is because you are so afraid to address the roots.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.860]   And here's what I mean by addressing roots.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.340]   I mean, really making yourself surface
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.620]   and think and deal with the things
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.700]   that have deeply wounded you.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.300]   The things that have really hurt you
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.620]   or the thing that you have never told someone
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.420]   or that you're most ashamed of or you're most hurt by,
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.900]   you're gonna have to actually think about those things
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.740]   and that is not fun.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.500]   I always say, let's be real,
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.380]   it hurts to think about the things that hurt you.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.500]   We all agree?
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.340]   Like it hurts.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.160]   No one wants to sit there
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.460]   and think about the time they were cheated on.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.620]   I mean, it was like, you want me to what?
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.940]   You want me to think about that?
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.960]   And it's like, yeah, I do.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.180]   No one wants to think about the things that hurt them,
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.800]   but it's what you have to do.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.300]   If you want to experience healing now,
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.760]   if you wanna stop running to numbing and coping,
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.580]   you have to address the roots.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.020]   So what do I mean by that?
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.320]   What do you mean by addressing the roots?
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.380]   Here's just some examples of what I mean,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.640]   what it really looks like practically
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.380]   to address where you're numbing
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.480]   and how it's 'cause you're trying to escape
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.620]   because you don't wanna address roots.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.860]   Some of you, after you eat, you go into the bathroom
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.680]   and you make yourself throw up
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.360]   and you've convinced yourself, here's why.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.540]   I just wanna be skinnier
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.000]   and I just wanna be more attractive and this is how I do it.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.860]   It's just a quick way to be skinnier.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.360]   And no, that's not why.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.200]   You do it because that is the one time in your life
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.360]   that you have total control
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.920]   of what's going on in your world.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.400]   And that's all rooted in your parents' divorce
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.200]   in junior high that you had no control over.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.320]   So therefore you've experienced such instability
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.580]   all of your life that has produced so much pain
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.200]   that now you're a control freak
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.720]   and you choose to throw up
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.140]   because it's when you actually have control.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.980]   Throwing up is not your problem.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.420]   You've made it your solution.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.120]   Your problem is that you need to address
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.720]   that your parents' divorce deeply hurts you
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.400]   and that you felt rejected and not thought of
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.280]   and it created something in you
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.280]   that is now producing something that you never wanted to do.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.720]   For some of you, you're the weekend warrior.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.800]   You live for the weekends.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.200]   You're the life of the party.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.420]   You go out, you get high, you get blackout,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.720]   you hook up, you're on your game.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.860]   You told yourself, that's just what we do.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.080]   That's just who I am.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.280]   It's just fun, YOLO.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.380]   That's not why.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.560]   You do it because you moved to Dallas
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.760]   pursuing to climb the corporate ladder
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.640]   and you thought in the end it was results
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.800]   and you being validated
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.160]   and having some kind of significance to your life
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.840]   but you have to actually know that the reason why you do it
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.560]   is because you're miserable Monday to Thursday
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.400]   if you're honest.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.360]   And so your weekend is the time where you shine
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.480]   and where you escape
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.000]   from how pathetic you feel Monday through Thursday.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.440]   Alcohol is not your problem.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.160]   Partying is not your problem.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.920]   You've made it your solution.
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.160]   Your problem is that you are searching for significance
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.320]   in a job and in a position
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.720]   and climbing a ladder that has no end.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.200]   Pornography, something we talk about a lot here.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.840]   So many of us struggle with pornography.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.480]   Some of you can't even remember when it began.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.160]   It's just, it's everywhere.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.040]   It's such an epidemic and it is ruining.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.440]   It's a plague across this world.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   And we tell ourselves, everyone does it.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.640]   It's casual, man.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.960]   It's not hurting anyone.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.800]   It's just me.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.640]   It's just a quick fix.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.360]   It just feels good, dude.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.400]   No, that's not why.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.280]   You do it because you're insecure
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.200]   about maybe your body
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.320]   or the fact that no one's ever asked you on a date
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   or because every time you ask someone on a date,
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.480]   you get rejected
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.320]   or whatever it may be that produces that insecurity in you.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.360]   And in that moment, you have control, you have pleasure.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.440]   And on top of that, you feel more masculine.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.840]   Or if you're a woman, you feel more desirable.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.600]   That's why you look at it.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.840]   Pornography, it's not your problem.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   You've made it your solution.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.440]   Your problem is that you are searching for satisfaction.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   You are searching to be validated
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.020]   by something that will never satisfy.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.720]   You're looking for it in all the wrong places.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.600]   And right now, some of you are like, oh, it stings.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.560]   I know for me, I'm like, oh,
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.440]   there are still deeply rooted things going on in my life
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.000]   that hurt, that I need to address.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.720]   But if you want to actually experience the healing
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.080]   and freedom that Christ offers,
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.460]   you have to start with addressing the roots.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.960]   And the way that you do that, the way that you get healthy,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.920]   the way that you can actually address roots
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.740]   is to know truth, to know truth.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.700]   When you know truth, you're able to identify lies.
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.060]   You're able to identify things
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.600]   that just aren't actually happening.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.920]   You're able to like go, hey,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.240]   these aren't actually my problems.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.340]   These are my problems because I know truth.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.600]   Jesus literally said in John 8, 32,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.960]   "And you will know the truth
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.180]   and the truth will set you free."
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.800]   You're looking for freedom, know truth.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.260]   We're walking around with a bunch of people right now
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.080]   who don't know truth.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.020]   They don't open up their Bible to their believing lies.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.820]   They're being fed what culture says, this will satisfy.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.360]   This will bring you what you want.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.200]   You want a way out?
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.520]   You want to escape?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.480]   We have it for you.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   Take it, take social media, perform for other people,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.000]   drink alcohol, have sex, watch pornography, take it.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.720]   And we take it because we don't know truth.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.700]   Because if you actually open up the Bible
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.280]   and you believed what it said,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.120]   you would know that there is nothing but death
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.640]   in those things, but there's nothing but life in Jesus.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:09.800]   And so we need to be a generation that opens up our Bible
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.020]   in a world with so many false narratives,
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.280]   so many things, so many mixed messages,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   open up our Bible and know and study truth.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.400]   And when you know truth and when you read it,
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.500]   here's what you're gonna know.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.300]   That the truth is above anything else,
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.400]   that God is in the business of restoration.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.740]   He is looking to restore you.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.880]   These things that are deeply rooted in you,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.720]   He wants to restore them.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.360]   And when you begin to open up your Bible and read the story,
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.280]   here's what you're gonna read.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.760]   You're gonna read the greatest story of all time,
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.060]   that a father God saw the need of his children,
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.400]   saw the brokenness that was coming into your world,
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.120]   and he sent his one and only son to earth to bear your sin,
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.280]   bear your shame, bear your anxiety,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.560]   bear the things that happened to you
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560]   that you couldn't control.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.520]   He bore it.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.000]   He bore all the darkness, all the lies.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.560]   He bore it and he died.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.800]   He was the perfect sacrifice for me and for you.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.120]   And not only did he die, but they buried him,
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.240]   but they could not keep him there
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.440]   'cause three days later, he rose victoriously from the tomb,
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.840]   conquering sin, conquering shame, conquering your mess,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.760]   the thing that you are running to numbing and coping
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.000]   and all these things for,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.600]   he actually died so you could stop running to those things
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.680]   and start running to Jesus.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.440]   Start running to Him.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:33.960]   And we, as people, are spending our young adult years,
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.760]   the most formative years of your life.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.260]   You are spending your years running to something
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.640]   that has nothing for you.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.080]   Even though you know truth, I'm telling you truth,
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.880]   you can run to Jesus because when he died and rose again,
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.960]   it was paid in full.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.240]   Here's what Isaiah says.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.800]   Isaiah 53, five says,
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.040]   "But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.520]   "He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.760]   "The punishment that brought us peace was on him
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.960]   "and by his wounds, we are healed."
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.520]   In summary, we're wrapping up.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.400]   Here's what I want you guys to know.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.100]   Because of the blood of Jesus,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.740]   because of the sacrifice that he paid for us,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.360]   you are able to go home tonight
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.520]   and first admit that you are weak
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.080]   and that you have a problem.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.540]   You're able to admit that
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.880]   because Christ and his sacrifice for you
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.440]   allows you to be weak because he goes,
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.320]   "I know you're weak. I know you're broken.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.080]   "Father says, that's why I sent my son."
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.880]   You're able to then allow others in
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.640]   because God said, "Hey, I am so good.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.160]   "I love you so much
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.800]   "that I never wanted you to do this alone.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.880]   "You have me and then I'm giving you my people."
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   And then you're also able to lastly address the roots,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.240]   the things that you've believed for so long,
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.680]   the things that have wounded you for so long.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.480]   You are able to actually experience.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.040]   Some of you don't believe this still
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.320]   no matter how much I tell you,
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.880]   but let me tell you, listen,
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.360]   you are able to experience actual healing
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   and freedom in fullness, fullness.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.600]   You don't have to walk around
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.000]   like my finger partially healed.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.880]   You don't have to walk around with a limp all your life,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.240]   wounded and addicted and enslaved.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.640]   I'm so tired of people saying
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.480]   that they are image bearers of Christ
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.680]   yet walking around limping and weak.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.240]   He did not die for that.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   He died, He died so that you could be strong and victorious.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:48.520]   He died, He bore physical wounds
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.600]   so that your spiritual wounds could be forever healed.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.540]   By His stripes, we are healed.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.400]   You wanna find freedom?
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.520]   You wanna make the decision to stop numbing,
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.440]   stop coping, stop running to the things of this world,
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.440]   start running to the Father.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.160]   I don't care how many times you have to run,
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.640]   keep running and keep running and keep running
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.780]   because His arms are open for you.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.400]   And He's sitting here saying,
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.400]   "Hey, you're searching and I've already done everything.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.440]   It's not about what you do,
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.880]   it's about what I have already done.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.720]   I have bore the stripes so that you may be healed,
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.680]   that you may be free.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.760]   So maybe walk out of here tonight,
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.320]   not enslaved people, but free people."
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.100]   Let's pray.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.760]   Father,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:52.480]   I know the things that I have done
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   and I know where my heart is prone to wander
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:01.720]   and not want to really address what's really going on.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.840]   I don't really want to admit that I am so broken
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.480]   and so lonely apart from you.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.300]   And so I come here with my friends
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.720]   just saying, "We need you, Jesus.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.040]   We need you, Holy Spirit, to come and change our hearts
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.920]   and to remind our minds that in you,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.560]   in you alone is freedom."
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.960]   When the course of this world
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.280]   is throwing things at us saying,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.120]   "Here, taste this, taste this."
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.280]   And we just go again and again
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.560]   and we just remain thirsty and searching.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.700]   May we remember tonight,
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.600]   may tonight be the night that we decide
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.280]   that I am going all in with the sufficiency
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.420]   and the satisfaction that is in the fullness
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.400]   of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.840]   And I'm never going back.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.800]   I am taking a drink of the living water
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.460]   and I am never going to thirst again in Jesus' name.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.840]   If there are people here tonight
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.360]   who don't even know what it looks like
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.520]   to have a relationship with you,
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.040]   I pray that they would first
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:14.740]   allow themselves to come to you, confess,
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.780]   and to receive all that you have for them.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.000]   But for the rest of us that know you
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.920]   but don't live like it all the time,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.720]   we come here tonight saying we need you and we want you,
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.000]   and we're gonna keep running to you.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.180]   No longer running to the things of this world,
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.680]   but running to you.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.520]   It's your name that I pray, amen.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.320]   You guys can stand and sing with us.
