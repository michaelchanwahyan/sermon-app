[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:19.760]   All right, you guys have a good Thanksgiving?
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.560]   How about the Cowboys?
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.400]   Let's go, man.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.900]   I'll start out with how our Thanksgiving,
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.840]   Wednesday morning, we woke up and I was going out
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.280]   to load up my Tahoe and get it all ready
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.580]   because we were gonna drive to Houston
[00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.280]   to spend a couple days with my family down there
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.120]   for Thanksgiving.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   I load everything up in my car.
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.080]   We have an 11-month-old baby
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.640]   that only does not sleep in the car.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.840]   And so if you put him in the car during nap time,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.280]   just buckle up because you are about to get some screaming
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.160]   for the next few hours.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.560]   And so we planned it all out.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.840]   Nap time's gonna be over.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.640]   Grab the baby, put him in the car.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.560]   Get everything ready.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.800]   I've got the dog in the car.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.400]   I've got the suitcases in the car.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.440]   Got everything ready.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.840]   All I'm doing is waiting on the baby.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.760]   I go get gas, go get Flamin' Hot Cheetos
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.960]   'cause that's my wife's thing.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.360]   And yeah, I'll let you girl, okay.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.480]   And so anyways, I'm back in the car waiting.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.220]   Baby wakes up, put the baby in the car.
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.840]   Get everything ready, put the key in.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.800]   It won't turn over.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.760]   My battery completely dead.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.000]   Somehow it allowed me to drive to go get gas that morning,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.320]   but the battery acid has come out
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.520]   and so the battery's totally toast.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   Take everybody out of the car.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.320]   Get the dog out of the car.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.160]   Get the baby out of the car.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.980]   Get the wife out of the car.
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.240]   Get all the suitcases, put 'em in my wife's car.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.300]   Get everything loaded up.
[00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.260]   We take off to Houston.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.720]   We're headed there and we're just bracing ourselves
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.560]   for the baby who's about to go ballistic
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.320]   as soon as we get close to Houston.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.200]   We get close to Houston.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.040]   We take the exit.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.860]   Baby's doing okay.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.040]   Everything's looking fine.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.480]   We take the exit and I'm using this Waze app,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.720]   which is like a geography.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   Some Waze fans here tonight.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.720]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.120]   And so anyways, I'm on the feeder on the access road
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.240]   and I'm being told by Waze,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.440]   "Hey, take a left right here underneath 45."
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.280]   So I'm about to take a left.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.640]   All of a sudden it reroutes.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.740]   I don't know if you've seen this before.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.660]   It'll reroute and tell you,
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.500]   "Hey, there's a faster way.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.340]   "Go straight."
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.820]   So I go, "Oh, it says go straight."
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.700]   So I begin going straight.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.580]   Little did I know I was in a left only lane
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.540]   and the car to my right was also planning to turn left
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.000]   and I was supposed to turn left.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.100]   So I'm moving straight.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.080]   All of a sudden, huge collision into the side of our car.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.460]   Yeah, happy Thanksgiving.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460]   So now I'm like out of the car, crying baby.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.420]   Dog's freaking out.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.540]   Everyone's fine.
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.860]   The dog's probably the most injured at this point
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.240]   'cause he's like, when he gets nervous and scared,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.880]   he starts shedding like crazy.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.260]   So hair's going everywhere.
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.800]   (laughing)
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.640]   Oh man.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.960]   Anyways, the people in the other car are doing fine.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.660]   Everything's okay, but the car is significantly messed up
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.000]   and I'm like, "Can I drive this thing?"
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   The police officer comes.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.820]   He's like, "I don't know, man.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.660]   "You can roll the dice."
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.520]   And I was like, "I guess we'll roll it,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.200]   "zip tie it up, we'll be okay."
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.540]   And so drive the car, alignment is off.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.000]   For the rest of the trip there
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.800]   and the rest of the trip back two days later,
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.520]   the lights didn't work
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.340]   and so I had to hold the brights down the whole time.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.280]   Couldn't flip 'em on, had to hold the brights
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.780]   and drive for three and a half hours.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.020]   Now, everything is not going our way
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.300]   until we call the insurance company.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.020]   And I had never had a wreck like this before
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.420]   so I didn't know exactly what to expect.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.340]   I'd heard nightmares about like, man, insurance.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.740]   I mean, you'd better just wait because it is miserable.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.300]   Just, you better just get a bicycle
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.980]   'cause you're not gonna have a car for a while.
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.300]   And so I called the insurance,
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.140]   especially when it's your fault,
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.940]   which it was my fault, awesome.
[00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.640]   And so called the insurance company
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.680]   and it was like the greatest experience of all time.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.500]   Within an hour and a half, the lady's like,
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.120]   "Hey, I have a car for you.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.580]   "It's a Jeep, brand new, 500 miles on it.
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.420]   "You can take this.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.720]   "You're gonna use this for the next couple weeks.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.000]   "I've got it already set up for your car to be fixed.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.700]   "There's gonna be an adjuster come out."
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.980]   I mean, it was the best, Safeco was the company.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.120]   If you don't have Safeco, there you go.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.280]   That's free shout out, Safeco.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.700]   I'm open to sponsorships.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.520]   And so anyways, so unbelievable experience of like,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.920]   man, this is incredible.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.060]   I mean, literally within an hour and a half,
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.640]   everything taken care of.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.940]   Hey, we're gonna take the car and we will not stop
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.480]   until it is totally made new,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.880]   until everything broken on it has been restored and repaired.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.580]   We got you from here.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.640]   And the reason I start with that story
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   is because I think a lot of people,
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.760]   as it relates to Christianity,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.160]   the way that we think about, hey, if I become a Christian,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.680]   in the same way that the insurance company,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.080]   soon as they got involved, everything was made easier.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.240]   I got it from here.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.800]   This is the best, easiest experience you've ever had.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.200]   That's how a lot of people think,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.960]   'cause it relates to Christianity.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.940]   The moment you become a Christian, all of a sudden,
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.280]   hey, God, I reach out to you.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.600]   I trusted in Jesus Christ as my savior.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.840]   He is the one who died for my sins, rose again.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.960]   I'm trusting in that.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.520]   I've been given new life in him.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.920]   A lot of us would think that all of a sudden,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.320]   it's just gonna get easier from there,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.080]   that all my bad problems, all of them,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.360]   I'm just gonna wake up, they're gonna be gone.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.040]   That everything kind of, the character flaws that I had,
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.640]   all of them are gonna be dealt with immediately
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.880]   and all of them are going away.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.160]   And I'm here to tell you,
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.240]   and tonight we're gonna talk about
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.560]   how it's just not that easy.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440]   Now, I'm not talking about salvation.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.520]   Salvation, which is, hey, spend eternity with God,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.700]   that happens in a moment.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.020]   If you put your faith in Jesus Christ as your saver,
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.840]   the person, the God who became man,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.500]   who died for your sins on the cross and rose again,
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.800]   if you have trusted in that or put your faith
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.760]   that Jesus has paid for the debt that you
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.240]   and your mistakes and sin have created,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   in a moment, you have salvation internally.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.200]   What I'm talking about is not that.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.680]   I'm talking about what we call sanctification
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.000]   or the Christian journey of being made to look like Jesus,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.480]   which is a process and a journey that God takes us on
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.720]   and it doesn't just go, hey, man,
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.560]   I'm gonna hand this over to you
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.840]   and overnight, everything gets changed
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.120]   and everything gets better.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.340]   Now, sometimes that happens,
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.120]   but the reason I'm highlighting this,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.920]   the reason we're gonna talk about it tonight
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.780]   is because a lot of times,
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.000]   when you hear somebody on stage,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.400]   you hear these different testimonies in church,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   you're going, man, that dude, all of a sudden,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.720]   I just heard this story about a guy who trusted Christ,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.260]   I was a black tar heroine, it was crazy,
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.800]   and all of a sudden, trusted Jesus, never did it again.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.000]   Or stories like, man, I was addicted to pornography,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.040]   alcoholism, trusted Jesus, never, totally changed,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.040]   never even tempted again.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.340]   And those stories exist, but they're honestly the outliers.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.680]   The journey of the Christian faith
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.480]   is one of day by day sanctification
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.160]   and crucifying the flesh, the Bible calls it,
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.840]   or taking up your cross daily.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.240]   It is a process that God brings us on.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.960]   The journey of the Christian life is a process.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.720]   And so as we talk about amnesia,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.680]   which is a series on, hey,
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.020]   remembering who you are in Jesus,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.080]   this is specifically, if you're a Christian in the room,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.280]   who you are in Jesus, you're a new creation.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.000]   That's the position that God has given you,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.680]   you've been made new.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.280]   And now, tonight, what I wanna talk about
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.060]   is the process by which God not just takes you positionally,
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.620]   spiritually speaking, you're made new,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.280]   but the journey that he takes you on
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.560]   as soon as you trust Christ for the rest of your life
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.140]   of making you into that new creation.
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.080]   What does that look like?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.720]   So for the next 30 minutes or 25 minutes,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.360]   we're gonna talk about, start to finish,
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.160]   the journey, the things that are required
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   to experience change.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.840]   Tonight, if you take notes, you can write out,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.660]   what are we talking about?
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.080]   How to change.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.440]   How do Christians change?
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.040]   Because the Apostle Paul, over and over and over again,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.720]   gives this recipe of the three steps that are involved
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.680]   if you ever wanna experience change.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.600]   True, lasting, and meaningful change.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.640]   It'll involve the three things
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.840]   we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.600]   And so we're gonna be in Ephesians chapter four.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.720]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.400]   to Ephesians chapter four.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   As we dive in to this idea of how Christians change.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.880]   The book of Ephesians was written by the Apostle Paul
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.080]   to this church in Ephesus that had recently,
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.320]   it was a bunch of pagans before, they became Christians,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.440]   trying to figure out how to live out
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.540]   their new Christian faith.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.360]   So Paul writes him this letter.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   The city of Ephesus was this port city,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.900]   kinda like San Diego, only it had this huge temple there,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.040]   the temple of Diana, or of Artemis.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   And it was just an incredibly pagan society.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.360]   There are writings from this time that say
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.320]   Ephesus is the most vile place on the planet.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.240]   There was all kinds of prostitution going on,
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.840]   all these crazy pagan rituals that were involved in the city.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.400]   All of a sudden, some of these pagans
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.840]   become followers of Jesus,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.720]   and now how do we live out this new faith?
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.280]   How do we experience the change
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.720]   that Christ has brought us to?
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   So Paul begins to lay out what that looks like.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.240]   We'll start in verse 17 of chapter four.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.800]   Here's what he says.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.160]   Now I say this, and I testify in the Lord,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.000]   as though I say this and God with me agrees,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.440]   that you, talking in the church in Ephesus,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.360]   must no longer walk or live as the Gentiles do.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.120]   Gentiles is a word for someone who doesn't know God.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.960]   It's just a word for, hey,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.400]   they don't have a relationship with God.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.040]   You should no longer live as people
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.480]   who don't have a relationship with God.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.940]   They do so in the futility of their minds.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.600]   They're darkened in their understanding,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.900]   as though the light bulb hadn't clicked on who God is.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.080]   They don't have a relationship with him.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.240]   They're alienated or separated, your Bible may have,
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.800]   from the life of God because of the ignorance
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.200]   that's in them due to the hardness of their heart.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.360]   They become callous.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.000]   They've given themselves up to all kinds of sensuality,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.340]   greedy to practice every type of impurity.
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.080]   So Paul starts off and he says our first idea
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.360]   from this text, which is how does change occur?
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   The first thing I want you guys to make clear,
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.520]   Ephesian people, is that you're not to live
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.480]   like people who don't have a relationship with God
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.400]   because you have a relationship with God.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.620]   There was a time where you were cut off,
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.340]   you were separated, you didn't have a relationship.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.320]   Now you are no longer those people.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.100]   You have a relationship with him.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.340]   The first step, if anyone is on this journey,
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.800]   very simply, if you want to experience the change
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.440]   that Christ brings, the first step for you
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.880]   is to have a relationship or step into
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.120]   a relationship with God.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.920]   That's the very first idea from this text
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.240]   that Paul points to is that hey,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.240]   because you're in this relationship,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.880]   there should be change that begins to take place
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.940]   inside of your life.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.080]   What sets a person, or the first step,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.140]   for anyone who wants to change is to make sure
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.240]   that they have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.420]   What is God most concerned about
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.260]   when he looks down at humanity?
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.020]   It is not that they do a bunch of religious things.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.100]   It is that they have a relationship with him.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.020]   Your crazy uncle that you were sitting across from
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.320]   at Thanksgiving, your sister who's living with a boyfriend,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.540]   whatever the situation, your lesbian coworker,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.780]   what God is most concerned about is not their sin habits,
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.260]   not their struggles, not their sexual orientation.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.880]   What he is most and first and foremost concerned with
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.940]   is a relationship with him.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.880]   And it is that relationship that is the starting point
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.660]   for anyone who wants to experience true change
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.500]   in someone's life.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.620]   So Paul just says, look, hey, you have this relationship
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.640]   with God, you should be experiencing change,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.740]   or this is the first thing that will begin to move you
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.820]   in the direction of change,
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.180]   is this new day-by-day relationship.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.060]   It's not dissimilar to any relationship, honestly.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.620]   I mean, we've all seen the impact that a relationship has.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.280]   All of us have had friends that start dating someone,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.180]   and all of a sudden, things begin to change.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.320]   You're like, yeah, I don't think that's just random.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.260]   I don't know why you're shaving so much,
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.380]   but you're all of a sudden showering and shaving
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.900]   a lot more than normal, and you're into yoga, that's weird.
[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.880]   Ever since you started dating her, this seems to be,
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.280]   or the girl who all of a sudden is like,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.800]   into the Rangers, I love the Rangers.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.540]   You're like, you love the Rangers, you're from Baltimore.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.220]   Yeah, but I'm into the Rangers, I love it.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.860]   And all of a sudden, they just pick up
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.140]   these different habits, or they're like,
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.620]   man, I'm just really into baking now.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.840]   You're like, baking, really?
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.900]   It's because you started dating Barry.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.460]   And all of a sudden, you started baking for Barry.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.820]   That dating relationships we see can begin changing us.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.820]   In the same way, God, a relationship with him changes us.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.240]   I remember when I married my wife.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.540]   I saw very clearly the impact that bringing a woman
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.260]   into your life on a full-time basis has on you.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.060]   And buckle up, fellas.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.700]   And all of a sudden, it's like,
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.540]   hey, we are not sleeping on a futon anymore.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.740]   In fact, we're not even keeping the futon.
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.220]   And we are buying decorations.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.740]   I never would have bought decorations,
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.820]   so the things that I spent money on change.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.020]   My membership to things.
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.260]   I used to be in a flag football league, it was awesome.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.300]   Now I'm a member at the Arboretum.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.220]   We go see flowers for fun.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.660]   The things that I'm involved in,
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.260]   everything changes from the things that you eat.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.660]   We got an amen from the ladies in the crowd, let's go.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.340]   And the things that you eat, guys,
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.620]   we don't, when you're a single guy,
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.100]   you just, food is utility, utilitarian.
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.680]   You're just kinda like, hey, whatever's there.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.380]   And Jack in the Box is fine, or this frozen pizza.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.540]   And then when you get married,
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.060]   all of a sudden you sit down, you're eating a meal,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.620]   you're starting to put on married weight,
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.820]   and life just changes 'cause this relationship.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.220]   Paul says, hey, why would you think
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.180]   that a dating relationship would change you,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.140]   or a marriage relationship would change you,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.540]   and that a relationship with the God of the universe,
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.940]   the God who made you, knows everything about you,
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.720]   who created everything,
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.960]   who knows how everything best works,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.300]   why would you think that wouldn't change you?
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.800]   Of course it should change you.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.940]   And he says, Ephesians,
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.800]   live in light of this new relationship.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.400]   You are not like those other people in the world
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.680]   who do not have a relationship.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.960]   They're cut off from God.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.300]   That's not who you are.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.980]   Live in that new relationship.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.360]   The first way to experience change
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   is being a part of that new relationship, the God.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.040]   So that's step one, a very simple one.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.360]   A lot of us have experienced in the room.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.960]   But the second thing he begins to lay out
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.040]   is really at the heart of how people change.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   Here's what he says.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.760]   But that is not how you learned Christ.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.600]   Talking about, hey, the people of this world
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.120]   and detached from God, assuming you've heard about him
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.680]   and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.500]   to put off your old self,
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.440]   which belongs to your former manner of life
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.720]   and is corrupt through your deceitful desires.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.520]   So put off the old self, you were taught this,
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.400]   and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.080]   that your thinking would change.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.060]   And to put on the new self,
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.800]   created after the likeness of God,
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.100]   but the new self that God is moving you in the direction of,
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.160]   the new character that he wants to conform your character to
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.220]   is created after the likeness of God.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.800]   It reflects Jesus, you could say.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.280]   And in the true righteousness and holiness
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.000]   that Paul says, hey, you are different,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.400]   and now God wants to take you on the journey
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.000]   of becoming, of conforming your behavior
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.800]   to who you are spiritually speaking in Jesus.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.420]   That you've been given this righteous position,
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.920]   perfectly righteous, now for the rest of your life,
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.340]   God is gonna continue to conform and conform your character
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.760]   and your life consistent, to be consistent
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.480]   with that new character that you have.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.160]   But it requires, in order to change,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.760]   he just laid out something at the heart
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.760]   of the way that people begin to change their living
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.200]   or their lifestyle, which is their thinking.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.500]   Our second idea from the text is this,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.160]   that change requires new thinking.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.360]   How do people change?
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.840]   Man, this is so huge, and I really want you to hear this.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.680]   The way that Christians change is not by going,
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.900]   you know what, today is my day,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.680]   I am not going to be codependent in this relationship,
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.000]   pull the bootstraps up, I am doing this today.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.520]   The way that they begin to change,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.920]   whether it's an eating disorder,
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.480]   whether it is pornography,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.680]   whether it is a sexual addiction, alcohol addiction,
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.280]   whatever those different things are,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.860]   one of the most crucial components,
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.700]   beyond, hey, a relationship with God,
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.000]   is then beginning to change the way that they think.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.760]   The Bible calls it renewing their mind.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.500]   Replacing the lies that they believe
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.040]   with the truth of God's word.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.080]   That they've been taken out of sin.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.400]   In other words, that's the theological,
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.080]   which is just kind of the academic word for,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   hey, that's the relationship to God
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.720]   that they have on a spiritual level.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.520]   And now God has taken them out of sin,
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.780]   and for the rest of their life,
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.400]   he's gonna begin to take sin out of them.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.160]   That's the journey of the Christian faith.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   And it begins by changing the way that they think.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.120]   How do you put aside your old life?
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.720]   How do you just stop doing things?
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.760]   You begin to change the way that you think.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.360]   To align it with what God's word teaches
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   and what God's word says.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.840]   This past weekend I was with my brother
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.800]   who has this golden retriever named Riley.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.240]   Riley, he got like six years ago,
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.480]   and I remember when he got Riley,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.620]   and I was like, dude, this dog is,
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.000]   there's something wrong with this dog.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   He is not the sharpest tool in the shed,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.520]   the brightest crown in the crown box.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.120]   There is something off on this dog.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.440]   Like he would sleep in a crate
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.880]   without bedding or without a towel
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.080]   because he would like chew them up and eat them.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.360]   He would eat the towel.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.480]   They'd leave him in the backyard, he ate a hose.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.960]   Like how do you eat a hose?
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.600]   Like there was something off with his dog
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.560]   where he would just like freak out about different stuff,
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.860]   terrified of stairs.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.280]   When storms would come,
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.840]   they'd have to put booties on his feet
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.360]   because he would just run around in circles
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.400]   inside of the room.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   (laughing)
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.160]   And it would scratch up the floors.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.560]   And so anyway, so all this like crate man,
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.600]   there's something off with this dog.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.040]   And I remember talking to him a few years ago,
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.160]   and I was like, hey, what do you think is wrong?
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.240]   He was like, oh, he was abused.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.120]   He was like, he had an abusive owner before.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.840]   Like we rescued him from an abusive previous environment.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.280]   And so it's not, there was nothing mentally off.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.120]   He had just been abused, and that had impacted his thinking.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.640]   He would eat things that you shouldn't eat
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.520]   'cause he was like, am I gonna get fed?
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.480]   And over this weekend, I was with him again,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.800]   and I was like, man, this dog is normal.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.880]   I remember acting like,
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.760]   is this the same dog that you've had?
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.080]   Like he was totally normal.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.440]   He'd begun to adapt that he wasn't eating his bedding anymore
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.000]   that he wasn't terrified of like lights
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.840]   and things like that.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   Like all of a sudden his thinking had begun to change.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.360]   Because even though he had at one point early on
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.040]   been taken out of the abusive situation,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.800]   the abuse had not been fully taken out of him.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.080]   And so he had all these bad habits
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.680]   and it took time and relearning.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.400]   And all of a sudden on that journey
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.320]   where he began to realize,
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.840]   hey, if my master is my new master now,
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.040]   I don't have to eat the towel
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.920]   because he's going to feed me every day.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.800]   And his thinking began to change
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.520]   and his behavior began to change.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   And he became like totally different dog
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.320]   when I was with him this past weekend
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.800]   over the process of learning.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   And that's the journey just like
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.040]   he had been taken out of the abusive situation,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.920]   but it took time to get the abuse out of him.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.640]   In the same way, that's the Christian faith.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.960]   That's the Christian journey
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.000]   is that you've been totally taken out of sin,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.960]   not counted against you.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.800]   And now God is taking the sin out of you
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   that's inside of you and inside of me.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.240]   That's the journey of Christianity.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.840]   And the way that he takes it out
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.000]   is by changing your thinking,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.020]   changing my thinking.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.440]   Paul says this in Romans chapter 12, verse two,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.280]   where he says,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.800]   "Don't be conformed to the pattern of this world.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.240]   "Don't be like everybody else in the world.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.460]   "Hey, stop being pushed into the same corner
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.680]   "that everybody else behaves like,
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.600]   "but be transformed."
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.720]   How am I transformed, Paul?
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.800]   By the renewing of your mind.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   That it's not just try harder,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.240]   it is saturate your minds with what is true.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.360]   Begin to take off the lies that you believe
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.800]   about sexuality, about money,
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.520]   about dating relationships, about family,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.960]   about your job, about purpose,
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.640]   about anxiety, about whatever it is.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.160]   I mean, every sin struggle that's represented in the room,
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.280]   all of them are fueled by a lie.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.960]   All of them.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.140]   And the way that you combat that lie
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.980]   is not just by being like,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.120]   "Stop it, I'm not gonna do that anymore today."
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.920]   Stop being anxious, anxiety.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.760]   The Bible says, "Don't be anxious about anything."
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.080]   The way that you combat anxiety
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.020]   is not by me saying like,
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.020]   "Hey, stop it.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.920]   "Just don't worry about anything."
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.440]   That's not gonna work.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.040]   The way that you combat anxiety
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.320]   is by saturating your mind in what is true.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.560]   I'm anxious today.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.180]   God, I'm afraid that you're not good,
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.200]   you're not in control.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.680]   Everything's spinning out of control.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.840]   And I begin to embrace and start believing
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.960]   that God is good.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.880]   He loves me.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.080]   He's in control.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.480]   He knows what I'm going through.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.240]   He does not make mistakes.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.680]   I can trust him.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.700]   I do not know what tomorrow holds,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.620]   but I know that my God who loves me holds tomorrow.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.700]   The way that you combat that,
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.720]   the way that you combat pornography
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.560]   is not by just saying,
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.080]   "Hey, stop wanting to look at porn."
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.200]   But by saturating your mind in what is true,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.380]   part of which is the consequences of pornography.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.880]   If you're looking at pornography,
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.720]   it is going to cost you in your relationships
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.000]   in this season and in the future relationships
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.720]   if you continue to learn from 3D or two-dimensional images,
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.920]   "Hey, this is what a healthy sexual life
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.800]   "is gonna look like."
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.280]   There's gonna be more than one woman.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.320]   She's gonna have all kinds of augmentation,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.880]   or there's gonna be more than one guy,
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.520]   or he's gonna look in a certain way
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.000]   that you're feeding yourself something
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.920]   that is going to destroy you now and your future marriage,
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.180]   or it's going to hurt you in those future relationships.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.840]   You saturate your mind in what is true.
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.040]   Same thing with sexuality.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.240]   The way that you, "Hey, I'm gonna stop wanting to have sex,"
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.840]   is not by saying, "Hey, stop it,"
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.320]   but by reminding yourself or getting familiar
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.280]   with God's design, what is sex for?
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.000]   It was created for the context of marriage,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.220]   this incredible gift that God has given
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.380]   for man and woman to be united together,
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.980]   this powerful thing that he's given
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.820]   that can be powerful and powerfully destructive
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.420]   outside of the context it was created for.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.980]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.100]   But it can be this incredibly uniting gift inside of it.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.300]   The way that you deal with anger
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.820]   is not by just saying, "Hey, stop being angry,"
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.940]   or whatever the sense of selfishness.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.420]   It's not by just being like, "No, hey, stop being selfish."
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.980]   It's by learning to understand the world's not about you.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.380]   It never has been and never will be,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.740]   and you can either keep fighting
[00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.620]   for your little cameo in this world,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.900]   or you can experience your purpose,
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.780]   which comes from living for God,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.620]   who all of life is ultimately about.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.140]   The way that you and I experience new living
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.820]   is by new thinking.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.100]   The way that you change is by changing the way
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.060]   that you think.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.260]   And Paul lays out, I mean, honestly,
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.940]   Jesus said this, when Jesus spoke,
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.980]   and you've probably heard this before,
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.260]   'cause politicians have quoted where he said,
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.740]   "Hey, look, if you want to be set free,
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.700]   "it won't come by trying harder,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.660]   "getting into some club, being a part of a group,
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.180]   "just buckling up and really giving it your all.
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.660]   "It'll come by you knowing the truth,
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.380]   "and the truth will set you free."
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.740]   That if you wanna step up to the line of freedom
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.340]   and cross over it, it comes by embracing,
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.700]   by replacing the lies that you believe
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.080]   with the truth found in God's Word.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.060]   That's how Christians change.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.060]   That's how you will change, if you ever change.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.980]   And I love where Paul goes next,
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.260]   because if you're like me, and you're going,
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.380]   "Look, that's great, okay, so the way that I change,
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.240]   "I have a relationship with God, okay, check.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.540]   "I have a relationship with God."
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.780]   And then I begin to renew my mind,
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.300]   I begin to take off the old, the lies that I believe,
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.860]   and I begin to put on the new.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.180]   So the way that I combat lust, anxiety, anger,
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.020]   all those things, is I replace the lies
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.940]   that I'm tempted to believe with God's Word.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.940]   Okay, great, what do I do when I know
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.580]   all the Bible verses about lust,
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.700]   but, or I know many of them, and I'm still tempted to lust,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.860]   I still want to lust, I still lust.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.260]   What do I do then, Paul?
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.340]   And I love where he goes next,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.240]   because that's exactly where he goes.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.040]   He says this in verse 25.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.400]   "Therefore, having put away falsehood, or the lies,
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.380]   "let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor."
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.580]   Be honest with his neighbor,
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.200]   or his brother you may have there.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.700]   "For we are members of one another,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.600]   "that in this new life, to experience the new change,
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.860]   "we do it together, that we speak the truth
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.900]   "openly and honestly with one another."
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.700]   We live in authentic relationships,
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.100]   because we're members of one another.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.460]   In other words, I can be honest about where I'm falling,
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.580]   where my struggles are, who I am,
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.740]   because I know that in the security of Christ,
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.700]   as Christian brothers and sisters,
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.580]   inside of community, or just as Christians together,
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.380]   that my struggles are not gonna send people away from me,
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.300]   that I can be honest.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.940]   The third idea that he goes to is,
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.100]   hey, you not only renew your mind,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.520]   but you do all of this within the context of community.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.680]   The third idea, if you wanna experience change,
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.000]   is that you do so within the context of community.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.880]   Change requires community.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.040]   You require other people.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.480]   You will not change on your own.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.200]   I will not change on my own.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.920]   And Paul says, hey, it requires, this is a one another.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.120]   Christianity is a team sport.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.820]   Always has been, always will be.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.260]   This ain't golf, this is basketball.
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.440]   You play it together.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.960]   And then he goes into, really, what that looks like,
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.800]   in verse 26, where he goes into,
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.100]   hey, if you're angry, deal with the conflict.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.980]   Don't steal, but provide for people.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:56.980]   Give to other people.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.080]   Don't use your mouth to tear people down.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.900]   Use your mouth to build your brothers and sisters up.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.820]   Don't be bitter.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.460]   Deal with bitterness in your heart.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.660]   Forgive one another as Christ.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.980]   Be kind to one another, one another, one another,
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.320]   that Paul says, hey, you do this, the new life.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.620]   You will not experience change alone.
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:17.780]   The way that people and Christians experience change
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.260]   is together, because there's moments,
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.460]   like in your life and in my life,
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.840]   where, hey, I know the truth.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.220]   This happened a couple weeks ago.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.740]   After I taught a message at the porch,
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.440]   I go home, get on social media,
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.980]   just checking out how things had gone.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.040]   I got finished preaching that night.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.420]   Get on social media, all of a sudden,
[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.980]   I see someone who had recently posted,
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.020]   looked like a girl who I was not familiar with
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.400]   that was either some sort of dancer or cheerleader.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.120]   All I saw was cleavage and shiny.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.180]   And I'm like, huh, I wonder if I know this person.
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.920]   Click on it, click on an image,
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.580]   and hopes underneath the veil of,
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.880]   man, I'm just curious what this could be,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.120]   knowing that really I was going,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.320]   man, I think I just wanna see some cleavage.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:03.280]   And I know all the verses about sexual immorality.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.840]   Like I know 1 Corinthians 6, it says,
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.920]   flee sexual immorality, sexual immorality.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.320]   Every other sin that a person commits outside of the body,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.080]   he commits against himself when he commits sexual immorality.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.080]   You were bought with a price.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.480]   Therefore, glorify God with your body.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.560]   1 Thessalonians 4, 3 and 4,
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.160]   that this is the will of God, your sanctification,
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.600]   that you not engage in sexual immorality
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.440]   as the pagans who do not know God,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   but you control your body
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.200]   and have overflowed the relationship you have with him.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.960]   Psalm 119, verse nine,
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.400]   that this is how can a young man keep his way pure
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.120]   by living according to, like I know all those things.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.520]   But still, there's something inside of me
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.700]   that I'm still broken.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.600]   There's a sinful nature.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.280]   There's an old life present
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.400]   that despite knowing that,
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.840]   despite trying to renew my mind,
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.880]   there's times where I'm going, look,
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.440]   God, I need others around me.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.320]   Immediately what I did after I clicked on that,
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.120]   I shut it down, I emailed my guys,
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   I emailed JP, I said, hey, this is what happened.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.160]   This is what I saw.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.680]   These are the two pictures that I saw.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.640]   I want you to know, I want you to pray for me,
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.120]   and I wanna drag that into the light
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.340]   because I need you to know
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.080]   that I am capable of continuing to run down that trail.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.380]   And so I need you to lock arms and hold onto me,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.800]   just like God designed all of us to exist in relationship,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.600]   because I want to continue to change.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.440]   And the way that I change
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.720]   is by living in authentic community.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.740]   Will you help me?
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.200]   (congregation applauding)
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.600]   And yeah, you can clap.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.960]   I don't know where you are in that spectrum.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.600]   If you have community, that's the way that we change.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.680]   And it is through allowing others in our life
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.160]   to speak into our life that we begin to change.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.720]   Like, I mean, how crazy.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.200]   And this is the deceptiveness of sin, at least in my life.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.040]   You may not be like this.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.760]   You may be like, no, dude, I don't struggle like that.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.880]   I can get done preaching a sermon
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.160]   and all about, hey, living Christian life,
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.000]   this is how you're gonna live it,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.440]   and then I can go home and despite knowing the truth,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.400]   I'm still appealed to by my sinful nature.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.640]   I still wanna go after unless,
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.320]   I still wanna go, look, I can still leave a sermon
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.360]   that I'm done teaching and still go be short with my wife.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.840]   And this is where Paul says, look, hey,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.160]   there's a part of it where it's renewing your mind.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.280]   And then there's times where even though I know the truth,
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.440]   I'm still tempted, I'm still alert by what is dead
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.840]   and dying and is a part of my past.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.960]   And Paul says in those moments,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.640]   that's why community is so important.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:08.480]   You have other people that lock arms with you and say,
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.000]   look, we're gonna go two steps forward.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.160]   You take one step back, I'm not letting you keep going.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.520]   We're gonna continue to move forward in this.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.040]   We're locking arms together is how Christianity is lived out.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.200]   If you're gonna experience change,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.960]   it's gonna happen in that context.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.560]   If you are not plugged into a church,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.760]   you will not experience change in 2016 or 2017.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.680]   If you're not in deep, authentic, real relationships
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.040]   with other believers, you can just pretty much go,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.840]   hey, you know what, I'm gonna check my 20s.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.040]   Nothing's gonna change.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.440]   I'll probably actually go backwards in my faith.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.960]   This is the way that God changes people.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.320]   That you have a relationship with him.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.840]   He begins to renew your mind.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:48.400]   And through real relationships,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.120]   he begins to change you and change me,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.680]   especially in those sins where, man, I know it,
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.800]   but I'm still tempted despite knowing the truth
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.160]   to run after and I need your help.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.080]   And there's nothing different.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.400]   I mean, there's no secret sauce of anyone on this stage.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.520]   You think that we're not broken, messed up people
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.320]   who need other believers in our life
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.800]   who are going, hey, I'm gonna help you here
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.960]   because you're not thinking right
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.480]   and you're wanting to run after that.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.320]   That all of us are in desperate need of one another.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.640]   Paul says you were designed to live that way.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.960]   Live truthfully, hold one another accountable, be honest,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.800]   live openly in relationship with other Christians.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.840]   This is how it's always been done.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.040]   Andy can come up and I'm gonna lay on the plane
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.160]   and close here.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.720]   One, I'm gonna tell you about one of the earliest
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.200]   incidences we have recorded of just a guy who says
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.280]   this about Christians.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.840]   In other words, back in the first century,
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.960]   one of the earliest writings that we have about Christians,
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.300]   it says just exactly what we're talking about tonight.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.520]   It points to the idea that, man, this is how Christians
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.760]   have always done it, even in 111 AD.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.920]   This guy named Pliny the Younger,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.600]   which is like an amazing rapper name,
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.320]   Pliny the Younger writes to the emperor,
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.440]   he's the governor of this entire area where Ephesus is.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.640]   Ephesus was like a state, so it'd be like Texas
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.720]   and he's writing a letter to the emperor,
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.200]   which is like the president of Rome.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.480]   So it'd be like Greg Abbott writing Obama,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.080]   being like, hey, let me tell you about Watermark,
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.440]   here's what I found out about these people.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.880]   And he writes this letter and he writes and describes,
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   hey, Christians are kind of new on the scene,
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.460]   I've done some investigative work,
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.320]   not exactly sure what I think about these people,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.760]   but here's what I found out they do.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.960]   Here's what they gather in this little top secret meeting
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.680]   and what they do and he lays this out.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   Here's what he says.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.240]   The sum and substance of their fault or their error
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.480]   had been that they were accustomed,
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.860]   so Pliny's going, I'm not a Christian,
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.640]   but here's what I've, he even tortured people and said,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.400]   I wanna know exactly what you're doing in there.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.560]   Is that they come together on a fixed day before dawn.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.360]   So they get together, it's still dark outside.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.400]   They sing a hymn to Christ as God.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.480]   I mean, if you're a Christian,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.440]   these are your brothers and sisters from the first century.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.940]   And then they bind themselves to an oath.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.780]   So they get down, they sing a song,
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.740]   they sing to Jesus or Christ as though he's a God.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.300]   And then they take this pledge together.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.060]   They say, I'm in again, I'm in for today.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.020]   Are you in for today?
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.360]   And they take this pledge together,
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.780]   but it's not some pledge to commit a crime, he says,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.340]   but it's a pledge to not commit fraud,
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.660]   to not commit theft, to not steal today.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:27.620]   I'm not gonna steal today.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:28.580]   I need you to hold me accountable,
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:29.580]   I'm holding you accountable.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:34.580]   To not commit adultery or to falsify their trust or to lie.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.140]   Or to refuse to return a trust when called upon so to do so.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.500]   Hey, I'm gonna pay my debts.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.980]   And when this was over, they went about it,
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.180]   it was their custom to depart
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.160]   and assemble again to partake of food.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.060]   They would go, they'd go work their jobs in the day,
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.260]   and then they'd come back together,
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.020]   say, hey, how'd you do today?
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.220]   Hey, how'd you do today?
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.580]   And then they'd gather again on another morning before dawn,
[00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.460]   and they'd say, I need you to not let me go.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.100]   I don't wanna commit adultery today.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:02.940]   I don't wanna lie today.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.780]   I don't wanna steal today.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:04.620]   Will you help me?
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:05.440]   I'm gonna help you.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   It's always been done like this.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.500]   This is how the church changed the world.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.360]   This is how the Ephesian church changed the world.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.180]   This is how Christianity's experienced change
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.380]   in their world.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:20.380]   And if you are a Christian, this is how you will change.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.600]   This is how you will experience change.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.260]   And it's always been this way from the very beginning.
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.980]   For whatever reason that ministered me so much,
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.460]   so man, man, it's, when I look back
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.180]   in the explosive growth of the first century,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.340]   I'm like, I guess God was just really behind them there.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:37.100]   They were doing the exact same thing
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.140]   that we're talking about here,
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.460]   where you gather together, say, I'm not letting you go.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:46.700]   And day after day, we're gonna walk through life together
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.100]   and help one another live the new life.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.280]   And that's how people change.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.140]   My car, when I got back to Dallas,
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.640]   my wife's car got turned in and all that,
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.180]   but my car, you know, it wouldn't start.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.240]   So it called AAA.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.820]   We have AAA, it's awesome.
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.660]   Just a side note.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.660]   And so they came out and they were gonna replace the battery
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:11.260]   and I was talking with the guy who was putting in the battery
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.100]   and I just said, hey, do you have a faith?
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.740]   And we began talking about kind of faith
[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.940]   and where he was from and how he'd grown up.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.980]   And he said, you know, I was raised Christian,
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.940]   or yeah, a Christian, but you know,
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.420]   I've not been in church in a while
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.580]   and I really haven't focused on my relationship with God,
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.860]   but I feel like God is really trying to speak to me
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.680]   and he's saying something.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.980]   I feel like he keeps sending me signs and messages.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.100]   We talked through a little bit of like,
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.660]   hey, what does he mean to be a Christian?
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.100]   What is a Christian?
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.700]   And then he said, and I came back to,
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.660]   hey, what are the signs?
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.300]   What does that mean?
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.620]   He said, well, this conversation for one, you know,
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.300]   and talking about faith.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.020]   And then he said, and then I had this friend that,
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.620]   man, her life has like been totally changed.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.300]   Like she like is in church like three times a week.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.300]   Everything has changed.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.260]   We used to smoke weed all the time together.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.300]   And then this tornado hit the apartment complex
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.460]   that she lived in and we lived there too.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.700]   And her life like totally changed.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.100]   And she's now all about church.
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.060]   She keeps inviting me to come to church with her
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.440]   and it's this place and she goes,
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.460]   he goes, it's this place called Waterview or,
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.700]   I said, Watermark?
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.860]   And he said, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Watermark, Watermark.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.700]   She's always telling me to come
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.180]   to this Tuesday night Bible study.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.220]   And I was like, man, that's where I go.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.500]   I go to Watermark and I go to that Tuesday night
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.660]   Bible study.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.740]   And as I thought about that, man,
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.700]   he reflected on, man, her life has been totally changed.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.240]   How did it get changed?
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.060]   Well, she had a relationship with God.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.300]   She began walking in that relationship with God
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.300]   and changing her mind by changing her playmates
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.140]   in her playground.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:53.860]   She's in church like three days a week.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.780]   She's always there.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.740]   It's at the center of her life
[00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.180]   and her life has been changed.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.200]   Your life, if it is going to be changed,
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.620]   this will be how.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.860]   A relationship, maybe you can go,
[00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.500]   hey, check the box, I'm there.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.100]   Then beginning to renew your mind
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.500]   with the truth of God's word
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.900]   and then with the real relationships of other believers
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:21.980]   where you're open and honest,
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.060]   they can speak into it and they can help you grow
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.460]   and you help them grow.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.620]   This is how Christians change.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:31.260]   And when they do, they change the world.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.900]   Let me pray.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.260]   Father, thank you just for the example
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.660]   of our brothers and sisters
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:43.500]   who before there was even a United States,
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.660]   before there were any of the things
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.860]   that like our common modern world experiences,
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.540]   they were gathering together saying,
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.580]   I'm gonna hold you accountable.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.420]   I need you to help me.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.060]   I need to help you.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.460]   Let's go one more day together.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.300]   They were coming together,
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.820]   they're worshiping Jesus as Christ.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.640]   He was at the center of their life.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:10.900]   Thank you for examples of just lives that have been changed.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.220]   Thank you for changing my life
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.140]   and continuing to change my life,
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.180]   for continuing to provide just the protection of community
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.220]   that allows me to be open and honest and say,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.760]   hey, I don't wanna look at this.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.760]   I don't want to be angry like this.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.100]   I don't want to be this man.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.040]   Will you help me?
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.640]   Thank you that you love us, God.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.700]   You've already declared us righteous
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.340]   if we have put our trust in Jesus.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.220]   And now you are not letting us go
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.860]   until we are totally conformed to that righteousness
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.900]   that is perfectly ours and will be perfectly ours
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.660]   for all of eternity.
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.340]   Father, we worship you now.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.980]   And we come to the altar of the God
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.820]   whose arms are open wide, who loves us and died for us.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.660]   Amen.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.480]   Amen.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.640]   I think the biggest burden that I feel in this message
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.960]   is that some of you would walk out of here
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.840]   thinking that you should bear a cross and wait for a crown
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.240]   and there's no crown coming
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.100]   because you don't have a relationship with God.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.160]   You've never accepted what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.560]   His payment for your sin, you may believe it.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.020]   You may be raised Christian.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.020]   You were culturally a Christian.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.420]   You've never actually put your faith and trust.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.880]   You never accepted that free gift.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.220]   You don't have confidence that if you died tonight,
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.260]   you'd go spend eternity with God forever.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.320]   Or you have a false confidence
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.660]   because you think you're a good person.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.620]   And if you think you're a good person,
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.620]   you're not a Christian.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.180]   A Christian is someone who says,
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.300]   "I am an inherently broken person."
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.860]   But just like there's an insurance company
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.380]   that's gonna come and stick with it
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.600]   and come and heal and replace and restore,
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.520]   that's what Jesus has done.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.040]   And he offers that new life,
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.080]   both forever with God, if you will, in a moment, accept it,
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.300]   and to be with you on the journey forever,
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.360]   if you accept it, in this life,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.920]   to come and restore and heal.
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.460]   And you've never done that.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.260]   And you went to church.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.220]   You may have even said some prayer.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.900]   But I don't want you to leave here tonight.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.420]   I don't, God doesn't want you to leave here tonight.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.020]   There was a guy in our staff prayer this morning
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.100]   who just said, "Man, one of the guys that I grew up with,
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.060]   "he died of liver failure yesterday.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.080]   "And I was at the funeral and I thought,
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.500]   "Man, who have I not shared the hope of Christ with?
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.860]   "Man, I wish I would have done more to initiate,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.700]   "more to step out.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:44.960]   "And is there anyone else in my life
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.620]   "who I need to make sure I clarify?"
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.020]   But you know that the God who's there
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.900]   is not demanding something from you.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.220]   He's done something for you, right?
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.060]   You know that.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.420]   Have you accepted that?
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:02.620]   And so for many of you in the room, that's your first step.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.020]   Regardless of what change comes after that,
[00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.980]   that is the single thing that will determine,
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.380]   and that will, the biggest decision that you will make
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   for all of eternity, for thousands and thousands of years,
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.620]   begin then.
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.020]   And if you have never had that moment,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.100]   if you're unsure, if you've placed your trust
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.500]   in what even that means, we'd love to talk to you.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.820]   We'll have an entire team that every week
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.500]   gathers down here to speak, to wrestle with,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.220]   to talk through, pray with, answer questions,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.820]   be a shoulder to cry on, or just to laugh with,
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.900]   or talk with, or anything we can do to serve.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.180]   That's the entire reason they gather down here.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.540]   And we will stay, meet with, talk with you.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.380]   As long as you want, or until 10 o'clock.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:50.740]   We also have something called Port's Late Night,
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.020]   which is once a month, we just basically throw a party
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.820]   on the lobby, and a chance to connect,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.340]   and provide kind of alternatives
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.460]   to facilitate relationships platonically
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.860]   with people, to just get to connect,
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.180]   and provide alternatives to the bar scene,
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.940]   and the club scene, and just the Dallas life.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.180]   And so hang around with us, we'll be out there hanging out,
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.100]   and open community group.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.380]   If you're a guy and a girl, man, this,
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:18.540]   oh gosh, I want this so bad for so many of you.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.500]   If you're a guy and you do not have community,
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.500]   man, I am begging you, tonight is your night.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.380]   If you'll go right down this hall, there are normal guys.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.540]   They look just like you, they're wearing jeans,
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.380]   maybe they're wearing khakis, maybe they're tucking it in.
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.580]   They're just like you.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.780]   And they want to grow in their faith.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.180]   They're not gonna make you tell your SAT score,
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.220]   they're not gonna ask you to handle a snake,
[00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.480]   they're not gonna do anything weird,
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.180]   they're just gonna say, man, hey, this is my name,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.260]   this is what I'm walking through, what's your name?
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.740]   And they're gonna gather around.
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.220]   We do something called open community
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.500]   to give you an immediate step
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.100]   to where you don't have to go through life alone.
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.740]   If you're a girl, you can do the exact same thing
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.820]   right down this hallway, where leaders in our ministry
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.900]   will gather with you, sit with you, talk with you,
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.260]   very normal girls just like you.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.300]   They like baking occasionally in the Bachelorette
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.700]   probably more than they should,
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.340]   and they just want to walk through life
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.840]   and get to know Jesus better and help one another.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.300]   And so if you go right down this hallway,
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.500]   we don't have a college gathering tonight,
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.260]   we love you guys so stinking much.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.500]   Next week is our last course of the year,
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.760]   you don't want to miss it.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.180]   We are gonna have a fun and special night,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.020]   you don't want to miss it.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.420]   So we will be here next week
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.380]   and then the concert after that.
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:23.620]   We love you guys, go in and peace,
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.420]   the love and serve the Lord this week.
