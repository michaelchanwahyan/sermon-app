1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,300
 - All right, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,140
 we are back here live, the Porch Live Experience.

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,140
 So wherever you are tuning in from all over the world,

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,600
 literally, thank you for joining us.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,760
 We just wanna say that we're so glad you're here.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,440
 If we have not met, my name is JD Rogers,

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
 and this is honestly a first for me.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,360
 I am sitting here under extreme measures,

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,600
 social distancing, trying to keep away from everyone,

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,680
 and everyone here just trying to be really cautious.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,800
 And I want you guys to know that I've even asked

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,400
 a few friends to come up here and join me

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,360
 and just sit out here because I miss you guys.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,920
 Like, honestly, it is hard to be in this room right now

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,000
 and not look out and just be with my homies, my Porchies.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
 And so just know that you guys are so missed,

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,560
 but I'm so excited that the Lord has blessed Watermark

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 with this kind of technology where you and I

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
 get to still just learn more about Him

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,960
 and open up the Word together.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,960
 And so we're not starting a new series tonight.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,400
 We are just talking about something

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
 that really has been hitting home for me

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
 in the midst of corona.

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,400
 And before I tell you what it is,

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,280
 corona, I just, I want to be honest, I hate it.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,400
 I am tired of corona.

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,600
 I am ready to go back to reality.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,760
 One reason why is because I just miss getting a haircut.

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,240
 I miss having my haircut, the fresh fade.

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,440
 I just don't feel like myself.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,480
 I don't feel as confident walking around.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,100
 And just right now I'm looking, I'm kind of insecure,

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,940
 not going to lie.

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,080
 But there's so many things.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,520
 I miss going out to eat with my friends.

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,880
 I miss working in a public place

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,400
 where you can look at people and make eye contact

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,920
 and not feel like you have leprosy.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,440
 I'm walking around right now and anytime I see a human,

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,800
 I'm like, hi, am I, sorry.

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,600
 I'm acting so weird.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,760
 And if I'm being honest,

45
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,760
 I'm trying to get out of this season of corona.

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
 And as I'm thinking about that,

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
 it's really relatable to what we're talking about tonight.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,760
 Tonight, we're talking about our season of singleness.

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,720
 Singleness.

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,680
 And of course they have the single guy up here,

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
 shots fired to come up here and talk about this,

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,120
 but we are talking about singleness tonight

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
 in the midst of the season of corona.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,200
 And here's what I was thinking about.

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
 Here's the reality right now.

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,920
 The season of corona plus the season of singleness

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,200
 equals super single, but not able to mingle.

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,120
 Super single, but not able to mingle

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,720
 is the definition of my life right now.

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
 Normally in life, it's like, yeah, I'm single,

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 but what's up?

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 Going out with the homies, going to meet the people,

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,240
 going out in the town.

64
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,640
 And right now we have nothing to do,

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,080
 but sit at home and recognize how lonely we are.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
 And to make it worse, as this singleness

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,600
 when life was normal, wasn't already bad enough.

68
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,480
 Now we're forced to sit at home, scroll on Instagram

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,520
 and see all of the married couples doing couple things.

70
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,720
 And like with my boo in bed all day, movie marathon,

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,360
 or making TikToks.

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,040
 I mean, I see like 40 year olds on TikTok.

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,960
 I'm like, what are you?

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,640
 And it's just, I'm mad at everyone.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,800
 I'm looking out my window, eating Doritos

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,680
 and my PJs at 5 p.m. watching couples go on walks,

77
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,360
 but going by, and I'm just like, all right, it's just me.

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,760
 You're like, hey, how's it going?

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,120
 Just like, they're looking at me.

80
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,280
 And it's just, it's so real right now.

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
 Like it is the weirdest time being single

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,240
 in the midst of the season of Corona.

83
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,200
 And like I said, they kind of weirdly go hand in hand.

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,080
 Like just as I'm ready for Corona to be over,

85
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,000
 I'm honestly fed up with my season of singleness.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,640
 Like I am ready for singleness at times to be over.

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,120
 And I think it's because I view singleness like I do Corona.

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,600
 Like I see singleness low key as a virus,

89
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,960
 a virus that I want nothing to do with.

90
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,840
 I will look away.

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,800
 I will do everything in my power to not have to face it.

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
 And it's so funny because just like I approached Corona,

93
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
 I kind of approached singleness.

94
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,000
 Like the beginning of Corona,

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
 it was kind of like the millennial dream.

96
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,080
 It's like, we get to all stay home

97
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,880
 and like all of us are being creative on Instagram

98
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,680
 and like all these hilarious memes and this is fun.

99
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,400
 Ha ha ha, a new thing.

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
 Like, here we go.

101
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,400
 In the same way, like, you know,

102
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
 let's say you're in a long relationship

103
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,280
 and you know, like after you break up,

104
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,600
 you get with your bros or your girls and you're like,

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,040
 yeah, who needs relationships?

106
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
 It's time to be single.

107
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,640
 And we're all like, let's go out, let's have fun.

108
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,080
 And then over time, actually not very long,

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,520
 you're like, all right, I'm done with this.

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,960
 I am done with this.

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,880
 And that's what I feel like a lot of us are right now.

112
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
 Not only are we done with Corona,

113
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,920
 but a lot of us sit in the tension

114
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,640
 of being done with singleness.

115
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,320
 The difference between the Corona and singleness

116
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,120
 is where Corona does have a lot of negative effects

117
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,600
 and it is literally a virus

118
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,880
 that has caused a lot of pain and hurt.

119
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,280
 That is in no way the case for singleness.

120
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,720
 And if I'm being real with myself,

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,720
 I have to know and trust that the Bible says

122
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,920
 that singleness is actually a gift.

123
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,040
 And my first instinct, if I'm being honest,

124
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,280
 is not to believe that.

125
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,920
 I think a lot of us really would address

126
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,000
 and admit that we struggle with viewing singleness

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,200
 as a gift.

128
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,680
 And it can be really confusing when it's like,

129
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
 but I thought marriage was a good thing.

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,240
 Proverbs says, he who finds a wife

131
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,360
 finds favor with the Lord.

132
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,200
 I want some favor.

133
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,080
 And like, God saw that it wasn't good for man to be alone.

134
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,000
 So he gave him a helper

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,160
 and there's all these different questions of like,

136
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
 but I don't wanna be lonely.

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,400
 Is it wrong for me to wanna be married?

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,320
 And I just wanna stop right here,

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
 actually to address something.

140
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,440
 If you are not single, and when I say single,

141
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,880
 I mean someone who is not in marriage,

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
 like you're not married.

143
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,160
 So even if you're dating, I still am,

144
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,680
 I'm classifying you as single.

145
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,920
 And if you're with your significant other,

146
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,520
 you better be six feet apart right now.

147
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,520
 But no matter if you're single, dating, engaged, married,

148
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,080
 I think there are truths that we're gonna learn tonight

149
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 from God's word about how a single person should live

150
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,200
 that applies to everyone.

151
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,680
 I think we all have things to learn

152
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,360
 from what God intends for singles.

153
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,520
 Because no matter what, every single one of us

154
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,840
 know that we have an independent walk with the Lord.

155
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,120
 Like our walk with God is not a we thing,

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,000
 it's a me and God thing.

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,960
 It's independent.

158
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,880
 And there are things that if we will learn them,

159
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,000
 especially singles, if we would learn these truths

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,920
 we're gonna talk about tonight,

161
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,880
 we're gonna find so much more joy in the next thing.

162
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,440
 I don't know if your future is singleness,

163
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
 I don't know if it's in a relationship,

164
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 but whatever it is, if you, every single person

165
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,680
 are walking in these things we're learning tonight,

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,120
 you're gonna experience so much more joy

167
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,440
 and happiness and peace and rest.

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
 And so I just wanna jump in, I wanna get started.

169
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,920
 And tonight we're gonna talk about succeeding

170
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,000
 in this season of singleness.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,520
 Succeeding in this season of singleness.

172
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,840
 What do I mean by that?

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,040
 Right now, we are not only in the season of singleness,

174
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,400
 but like I said, we're also in this very unique season

175
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,240
 of all that COVID-19 brings into our life.

176
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,640
 A lot of people have reached out to the porch,

177
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,640
 letting us know, hey, I am more lonely than ever before.

178
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,000
 SOS, help, that's me.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,920
 I am like, at this point, I'm like Taylor Swift,

180
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
 like putting notes to the window

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,280
 to the people across the apartment,

182
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,840
 like anything to get some love.

183
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
 And I know right now, if you're a physical touch person,

184
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,320
 you're absolutely dying.

185
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,560
 You can't, you're like shaking to get out of the house

186
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,320
 and just be able to touch people again.

187
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,000
 Some of you, you might be introverts and you're like,

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,400
 dude, this is a dream.

189
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,120
 I don't know what you're talking about.

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,560
 But I think all of us will come to a place eventually

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,040
 where we just wanna get back to normalcy.

192
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,680
 This is such a unique time.

193
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,080
 But my fear is, is that we're gonna get out of this season

194
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,000
 and miss what God was trying to teach us.

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,040
 'Cause I do believe that God is trying to use,

196
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,480
 even though COVID has brought so much stress and pain.

197
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,160
 I know that people are losing jobs left and right.

198
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
 I know that people are getting sick.

199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
 Some of you might have family members and friends

200
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
 who are actually, that actually have corona

201
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
 and you're having to move back in with your family

202
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
 and, or all these different things.

203
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,480
 And you're going, what do I do with this?

204
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,800
 Like, I'm not diminishing that this season

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,400
 has brought a lot of stress and hurt.

206
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,520
 But I do believe that as we read the scriptures,

207
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,880
 we see that God is always clearly moving.

208
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,120
 He's always working.

209
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,960
 He's always trying to teach us something.

210
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,920
 He's always trying to bring us closer to his heart

211
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,000
 and what he wants for us.

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,520
 And I think he wants something for your singleness

213
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,760
 in this unique season of corona.

214
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,760
 So tonight, two ways to succeed in this season of singleness.

215
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,720
 Two ways to succeed in this season of singleness.

216
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,400
 The first way.

217
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,400
 The first way to succeed is to secure the right relationship.

218
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,680
 Secure the right relationship.

219
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,520
 Here's what I mean by that.

220
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
 A lot of us think, I mean, it's just,

221
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,960
 it's almost human nature to believe

222
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,040
 that relationships with people, a relationship,

223
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,520
 a spouse is gonna bring us fulfillment.

224
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,000
 It's gonna bring us satisfaction.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
 It's gonna bring us joy.

226
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
 And so we spend our entire life unsettled and uneasy

227
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,560
 and clawing to get out of singleness

228
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,480
 because we're trying to secure

229
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
 what we think is the right relationship.

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,760
 But reality is, is you're trying to put all your security

231
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
 and all your significance in the wrong relationship.

232
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,160
 And so what does it look like to secure ourselves

233
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,200
 in the right relationship?

234
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,160
 With the relationship with Jesus Christ.

235
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
 If you have your Bibles, which I hope you do,

236
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,520
 open up with me to 1 Corinthians 7.

237
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,840
 1 Corinthians 7.

238
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,960
 As you turn there, just a little bit of what's going on here.

239
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,920
 Paul is the author, the apostle Paul

240
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,600
 is the author of 1 Corinthians.

241
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,840
 And a lot of people are new to the faith.

242
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,320
 A lot of people are learning what it means

243
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
 to be a Christ follower.

244
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,840
 And Paul spends this letter to the church of Corinth

245
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,000
 telling them, hey, here is what it looks like

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,480
 to follow Jesus.

247
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,800
 'Cause they're going, what about this?

248
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,640
 What about this?

249
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,520
 Hey, so now that I'm a Christian, what about this?

250
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,360
 And what about this?

251
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,920
 And Paul's just addressing, hey, here's what this means.

252
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,000
 Here's God's design for your season of life.

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,960
 And so this is the part of 1 Corinthians 7

254
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,680
 where Paul just tells us,

255
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,520
 hey, here's God's design in singleness.

256
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
 Here's what it is, verse 32.

257
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,240
 "But I want you to be free from concern.

258
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
 One who is unmarried is concerned

259
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 about the things of the Lord,

260
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,040
 how he may please the Lord.

261
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,440
 But one who is married is concerned

262
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,720
 about the things of the world,

263
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
 how he may please his wife,

264
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,480
 and his interests are divided.

265
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,520
 The woman who is unmarried and the virgin

266
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,000
 is concerned about the things of the Lord,

267
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 that she may be holy both in body and spirit.

268
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,960
 But one who is married is concerned

269
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,040
 about the things of the world,

270
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,960
 how she may please her husband."

271
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
 And this is it.

272
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,600
 This is the thesis of your singleness.

273
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,240
 "This I say for your own benefit,

274
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,440
 not to put a restraint upon you,

275
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,360
 but to promote what is appropriate

276
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,000
 and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord."

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,400
 Paul is saying as a single person,

278
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
 he says in that chapter as well,

279
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,400
 hey, I wish that some of you were single like I am single.

280
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
 Paul was single and he's saying,

281
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,760
 because the reason, the benefits of singleness

282
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,720
 is it's a time in your life

283
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,880
 where you get to have undistracted, unbothered,

284
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,840
 complete, secure devotion in the Lord

285
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,520
 and nothing else is there to demand your attention.

286
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,320
 It's just you and God and what he wants for you.

287
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,360
 Paul's basically saying, hey,

288
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
 if I right now had to pick an army to go change the world,

289
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,000
 I would pick an army of young adult single people.

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 That's who I'm picking.

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,520
 That's my team.

292
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,640
 His A team are single people, you and I.

293
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,560
 Why?

294
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,560
 Because he understood that there was so much worth

295
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,960
 and there was so much to learn

296
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,200
 from our season of singleness.

297
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,680
 But you're never gonna see that.

298
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,440
 You're never gonna really understand that

299
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 if you're not secure in the whole object of this principle.

300
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,880
 Like, so what I mean by that is

301
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,000
 when I say secure the right relationship,

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
 I am saying you have to learn in this season.

303
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,720
 Like Paul is saying, he's saying,

304
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,960
 you need to be able to secure

305
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,040
 undistracted devotion to the Lord.

306
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,800
 Girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives, kids,

307
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,040
 great things, gifts from the Lord.

308
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,720
 But it just comes with it.

309
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,440
 Every one of my friends who are married tells me,

310
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,560
 hey, bro, don't wish it away.

311
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,680
 It is such a unique time where you get to grow

312
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,320
 and establish such security

313
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,520
 in the right relationship with Jesus.

314
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,000
 And it's so interesting as I'm thinking about,

315
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,320
 okay, well, how do I find security in my singleness?

316
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,920
 How do I find security in just me and God?

317
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,480
 Like, what does that look like?

318
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,680
 I was reminded of this story

319
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,240
 of a time where I felt very insecure in college.

320
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,480
 I was home with all my closest friends

321
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,200
 back before social distancing,

322
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880
 and we had a scary movie night

323
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,040
 and we were all piled up in the living room,

324
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,160
 all on a pallet and on the couches.

325
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,520
 And we watched the movie "Strangers,"

326
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,400
 which spoiler alert, if you've never seen it,

327
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,240
 I would advise you not to.

328
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,640
 It is the most terrifying movie

329
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
 I've ever seen in my entire life.

330
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,520
 The reason why is because there is no premise really

331
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,560
 as to why they're killing this couple.

332
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,240
 There's this couple, newlyweds,

333
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,760
 they are in this house in the middle of the woods,

334
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,320
 which was the first mistake.

335
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
 But these people come with these scary masks

336
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,240
 and they just torture them the entire movie.

337
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,440
 And at the end, she's like dragging her knife

338
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,800
 and the girl's like crawling away.

339
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,240
 And she's like, her last words are like,

340
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,720
 "Why are you doing this?"

341
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,880
 And the girl's like, "Because you were home."

342
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,040
 And then just stabs her.

343
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,360
 And you're like, "Oh my, what the?"

344
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,160
 And I was just so bothered

345
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,960
 that it kind of carried over to the next morning.

346
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,440
 So everyone's gone, my roommates were gone,

347
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
 I'm asleep on the couch.

348
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,480
 And all of a sudden I woke up to this unsettling feeling

349
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
 that I wasn't alone.

350
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,560
 And so I raised up me and my boxers only,

351
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,920
 sorry, bad image there.

352
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,680
 And I look through the blinds of the window

353
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,240
 and I see this man and he's like probably mid forties,

354
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,040
 too old to be in my backyard, that's the point.

355
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,000
 A picketed fence, no one should be in

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,680
 unless you are welcomed in, but he's in.

357
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,160
 And he's looking around and I'm like,

358
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,560
 "Oh my gosh, there's a thief in my backyard."

359
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,600
 And he starts walking towards the back door.

360
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,040
 And I'm like, "So what do I do?"

361
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
 I grab a bat and I start,

362
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,200
 no, I ran to the closet, I ran down the hall

363
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,880
 and I hid in the farthest room in the furthest closet.

364
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,680
 And I tucked myself behind the clothes in my underwear,

365
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,120
 crouched down like, "Oh my gosh, okay, what's happening?

366
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,280
 What's happening?"

367
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,240
 All of a sudden the door opens, "Anyone home?"

368
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,840
 And I'm like, "Nope, you know why I'm not home?

369
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,400
 Because in strangers last night, the person was home

370
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,720
 and that was enough reason for them to get killed.

371
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,680
 And I'm not trying to get killed, so I'm not home."

372
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
 He's gonna have to figure this out on his own.

373
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,400
 If he's trying to steal, he's stealing by himself today.

374
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,000
 And so I stay in the closet and all of a sudden

375
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
 I start hearing footsteps coming down the hall,

376
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,960
 right towards my direction.

377
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,320
 And I am tripping, I am breathing, my head is down,

378
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,680
 I am sweating.

379
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,840
 And all of a sudden out of all the rooms

380
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,080
 in the back of the hall, the room I'm in, I hear,

381
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,840
 (imitates door creaking)

382
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,520
 And I'm like, "Get some WD-40 on this stuff, please."

383
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,560
 And the door opens and he walks in

384
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,440
 and I'm like, "Why is this man in this room?"

385
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
 And then the doors are kind of partially,

386
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
 it's like those trifold doors.

387
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,800
 He opens them and I'm like, (imitates door creaking)

388
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,760
 And I put my head down in between my knees,

389
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,800
 like looking like Smeagol, you could kind of see.

390
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,680
 And he takes, I see him and I flinch

391
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,840
 and put my head back down

392
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,400
 and he brings the clothes towards me.

393
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
 And I'm like, "Oh my gosh."

394
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,840
 And then he grabs the other, he looks and I'm like,

395
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,680
 "What's going on?"

396
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,040
 And then he grabs, I look and I look up

397
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,320
 and I see his fingers and I'm like, "This is it."

398
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,720
 And I put my head down, if I can't see him,

399
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,640
 he can't see me.

400
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,160
 And he moves the clothes and I hear, "Oh my Jesus."

401
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
 And I was just, I didn't look at him.

402
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,200
 It was the most awkward,

403
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,040
 like you could cut the tension literally with a knife.

404
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,080
 And he's like, you could hear my breathing,

405
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,520
 I'm not looking, I'm not addressing it.

406
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,800
 Like this man never has seen my face.

407
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 And he's like, "Oh."

408
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,160
 And I just hear like some noises and then he leaves.

409
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,200
 This hurries out, the door closes.

410
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,840
 I fall out and I'm like, "Oh my gosh, like what just happened?

411
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,000
 Why, why, what's going on?"

412
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,160
 And I look up and I see that I hid in the one closet

413
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,680
 that had the electrical breakers in them.

414
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,440
 And this man was the renter's electrician

415
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,040
 trying to come and fix our house.

416
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,600
 And it's so funny because I think I view singleness

417
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,800
 like that man.

418
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
 It comes knocking at the door, just trying to help me.

419
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,360
 And I'm like, "Run away, run away."

420
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,480
 And like, I don't want to be sitting in like loneliness

421
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
 and in singleness and I hide in the closet.

422
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
 And a lot of you I think are hiding in the closet

423
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,320
 and it's time to come out, okay?

424
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
 I'm just gonna say it.

425
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,240
 It's time to come out and embrace and find security

426
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,760
 in this season that we're never gonna get back.

427
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,840
 We're never gonna get it back.

428
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,400
 Like God is going, this is such a gift.

429
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,520
 It's such a gift.

430
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
 And I think a lot of us are missing it

431
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,560
 because we're seeing it as something that wants to hurt us,

432
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,840
 not something that's gonna help us.

433
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
 And I think singleness is God's gift to help us.

434
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,400
 And so how do we secure that right relationship?

435
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,280
 Just like Paul says, let's reread it.

436
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,040
 To secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.

437
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,680
 So if I'm thinking,

438
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,720
 how do I secure my relationship with the Lord?

439
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,160
 Well, first off, like he says, it's just so practical.

440
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,520
 I need to be undistracted.

441
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
 Anything that's taking my attention away

442
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
 from my intimacy and my time with God,

443
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
 I need to remove or balance or change priorities.

444
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,320
 And I need to make God the number one priority in my life.

445
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,040
 So many of you have made God like a part of this agenda.

446
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,280
 You've made him like this thing.

447
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,840
 And I know for me, if I'm being real,

448
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,520
 there's so many times in my life where going to church,

449
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,360
 reading my Bible, praying,

450
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,760
 it's just this thing that I do in my schedule.

451
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,000
 It's not something that I am.

452
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,520
 It's not something I believe.

453
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,720
 It's not even something I want.

454
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,840
 I'm just like, well, let me check this off the list.

455
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,320
 And that's no way God,

456
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,480
 that's not how you establish security with someone.

457
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,360
 The more time you spend really desiring to be with someone,

458
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,440
 the more security you're gonna have in that relationship.

459
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,600
 And that's the same with God.

460
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,800
 The more time you spend with him, really spend with him.

461
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 And especially like,

462
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,720
 if you're looking for an undistracted time,

463
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,320
 I cannot think of a better one than quarantine.

464
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,040
 I cannot think of a better one than Corona

465
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,360
 and like all that it's brought.

466
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,280
 This is the most, this might be the most undistracted,

467
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,200
 nothing else is asking for your attention,

468
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,480
 time of your life.

469
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,680
 And I don't want us to waste it.

470
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
 And when I was writing this talk,

471
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,560
 I had to get real myself and go,

472
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,760
 JD, you've been wasting it.

473
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,600
 Like you have been wasting it.

474
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,360
 Those times that you watch those Netflix movies,

475
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,800
 you could have been memorizing scripture.

476
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 Those times that you sat there

477
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,600
 and just scrolled endlessly on social media,

478
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,280
 you could have been reading God's word

479
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,840
 or praying or listening to worship music.

480
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,160
 And I don't think God is sitting up there like,

481
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
 how dare you?

482
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,920
 I think God is going,

483
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,520
 I want you to want me and to be secure in me.

484
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,120
 And so I just want you guys to know that

485
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,600
 if you draw near to God,

486
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,720
 the word of God says that,

487
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,320
 draw near to God and he will draw near to you.

488
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240
 You wanna feel close to someone in this season,

489
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,080
 draw near to God, spend time with him.

490
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,280
 And here's just some practical things I wrote down.

491
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
 Watermark actually has a great resource

492
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,440
 called Join the Journey.

493
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,840
 You just type in jointhejourney.com

494
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,800
 and there is a daily Devo

495
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,600
 where you get to daily spend time with God.

496
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,760
 Memorizing scripture,

497
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,960
 writing scripture on your mirror, on your hand,

498
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
 on your, like picking up your phone,

499
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
 your screen saver on your phone,

500
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,480
 just anywhere you look

501
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,760
 and it's like a tendency for you to like,

502
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,840
 it's to distract you,

503
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,640
 like maybe putting a sticking note on your TV

504
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,480
 or on your Xbox controller or whatever it may be.

505
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,040
 Like choose before I do that,

506
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,120
 I'm gonna work on this, memorizing the scripture.

507
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,800
 The Bible says to hide God's word in our heart.

508
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
 Another one like prayer and worship.

509
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
 I think we don't understand the impact

510
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,680
 that prayer has on our life.

511
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,800
 Matthew talks about, I believe in Matthew 6,

512
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,120
 it talks about how God's design for prayer

513
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
 is that we would go away in our room,

514
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,480
 we would get away from everything,

515
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,720
 undistracted and we would pray to God.

516
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
 And it says, the God who sees you in secret

517
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,240
 will reward you in secret.

518
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,560
 He has reward, he has gifts,

519
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,560
 he has abundance of peace and joy and satisfaction

520
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,480
 when you come to him.

521
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,520
 And when you spend time with him,

522
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,840
 he's ready to give it to you,

523
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,600
 but you've got to want it.

524
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,080
 Another one I wrote down is journaling,

525
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
 just journaling your thoughts,

526
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,480
 journaling your prayer so you can go back and reflect

527
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,760
 and read what God's doing in this time.

528
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,560
 A tall task, maybe for some of you,

529
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,840
 it's like, I've never read the whole Bible.

530
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,560
 Like I claim to state my life on this thing

531
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
 and believe this book,

532
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,800
 but I've never even read the whole book.

533
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,840
 Just try, say, hey,

534
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,160
 I don't know how long this thing's gonna go,

535
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,880
 so I'm just gonna try to read it cover to cover.

536
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
 And there's so much resources online

537
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,880
 that you can go with parts that you don't understand,

538
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,840
 maybe investing in a study Bible

539
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,320
 so it can help you understand scripture

540
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,160
 that is harder to understand for you.

541
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,400
 And some of you, like,

542
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
 I know what I like to start with

543
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,240
 with people who are new to this

544
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,920
 and like trying to get really devoted

545
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,240
 and spending time with God is,

546
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,880
 I always say, hey, let's just start with the book of John.

547
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,840
 Let's just open up the book of John together

548
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,240
 and let's just read it one chapter a day.

549
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,600
 Let's just go through it and let's just see,

550
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,320
 let's just learn the story of the life of Jesus on earth.

551
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,560
 Read it like a movie,

552
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,000
 like read it like you're reading a screenplay

553
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,040
 and watch the life of Jesus unfold

554
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,560
 in this story in the book of John.

555
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,320
 Like some of you just need to take the next few days

556
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,960
 just studying the book of John.

557
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
 I don't know what it looks like for you.

558
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,520
 I think you can get real with yourself and go,

559
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,640
 what's the best way that I connect with God?

560
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,040
 Like, what are the things that I enjoy?

561
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,120
 And set aside undistracted time with Him.

562
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,720
 And the next thing it says is secure undistracted devotion.

563
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,400
 What does it look like to be devoted?

564
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,640
 We tend to be people that are scared of commitment,

565
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
 of being devoted to something,

566
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,320
 of putting our word and staking our commitment to something,

567
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
 but being devoted daily to Christ,

568
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
 saying I'm gonna wake up every day

569
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,680
 and spend time with God, I'm devoted to Him,

570
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
 will go so far.

571
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,520
 I'm reminded of in Luke chapter 10,

572
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,920
 there's a story of,

573
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
 I think that just perfectly illustrates this.

574
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,560
 It says, Luke 10, 38 through 42,

575
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,680
 the story of Mary and Martha.

576
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,040
 "As Jesus and His disciples were on their way,

577
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,120
 He came to a village where a woman named Martha

578
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,680
 opened her home to Him.

579
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,600
 She had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lord's feet,

580
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,240
 listening to what He said.

581
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,920
 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations

582
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,160
 that had to be made.

583
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,680
 She came to Him and asked, 'Lord,

584
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,480
 don't you care that my sister has left me

585
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
 to do all the work by myself?

586
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,760
 Tell her to help me.'"

587
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,720
 And Jesus, I love this.

588
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,040
 He says, "Martha, Martha,"

589
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,360
 and for me, it's JD, JD, "Shh,

590
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,640
 you are worried and upset about so many things,

591
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,280
 but few things are needed, or indeed only one.

592
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
 Mary has chosen what is better

593
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,760
 and it will not be taken away from her."

594
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,640
 I read that and I'm like,

595
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,680
 I wanna be, I'm often the Martha.

596
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,240
 I think that the things that I do for God

597
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,840
 are gonna make me better with God.

598
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,480
 Like, okay, if I read my Bible, if I do these things

599
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,920
 and I establish this like do relationship,

600
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,640
 like do, do, do.

601
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,840
 And now that all my work and my friends

602
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,600
 and the things that I used to fill my time with

603
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,720
 are taken away because of this season of quarantine,

604
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,240
 there's not really much that I can do.

605
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,720
 And so all that I'm left is to be like Mary

606
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,120
 and to sit at the feet of Jesus.

607
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,720
 And what I mean by that is like I talked about

608
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
 is being devoted and spending time with Him

609
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,080
 and trusting that that is what He wants

610
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,960
 and that that's what is gonna bring me actual peace

611
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,840
 and joy and fulfillment and satisfaction.

612
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,360
 And that's how you secure a right relationship

613
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,200
 with the Lord.

614
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,640
 There are so many things that we search

615
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,200
 to find security in, like I said,

616
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,800
 but if you would just trust,

617
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,440
 trust what Jesus says here, Martha,

618
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,760
 you're so concerned about so many things,

619
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,400
 but Mary, she's concerned about one thing.

620
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,280
 She's got it figured out.

621
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,160
 It's coming and just being with me,

622
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,000
 not doing and being a busy body.

623
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,560
 Your productivity doesn't produce more like prosperity

624
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,280
 with me or more favor with me.

625
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,200
 I just want you and I've always wanted you.

626
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,440
 And God wants you now in your singleness

627
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
 and He wants you in quarantine.

628
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,840
 And He's saying, you don't have to be lonely.

629
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,800
 You can spend time with me

630
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,920
 and I need to be reminded of that truth.

631
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,480
 So the first one, like I said,

632
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,800
 securing the right relationship,

633
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,360
 like just remember, it's not in a person,

634
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,200
 like it's not in an idea or dating or marriage.

635
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,000
 It's securing in this time,

636
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,520
 relationship with the Lord and with God.

637
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 And the second one,

638
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,360
 the second way we succeed in this season of singleness

639
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,640
 is to surrender to God's design.

640
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,480
 As I'm learning more of my Bible,

641
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,160
 I am seeing that God is a master, like designer.

642
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,800
 He is the creator of everything.

643
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,000
 He is the gift giver.

644
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,960
 He has all these things that I read

645
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,560
 and it's like, I wouldn't go,

646
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,120
 if I saw a painting, like,

647
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,640
 and I wanted to know about the idea

648
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
 and what gave the inspiration behind the painting,

649
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,800
 who am I gonna go to?

650
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,320
 I'm gonna go to the artist of that painting.

651
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,720
 And we search to find design,

652
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
 what we're looking for joy and for fulfillment.

653
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,640
 We search in all these places

654
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,560
 and God is going, hey, I'm the designer.

655
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,840
 I designed this season of singleness

656
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,760
 with so much for you that I want you to experience

657
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,360
 but you're gonna have to trust that design.

658
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,880
 And this illustrated for me,

659
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,960
 I was reminded of the first ever relationship actually

660
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,360
 in the Bible, Genesis three.

661
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,880
 You can turn me to Genesis three, one through seven.

662
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
 "Now the serpent was more crafty

663
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,560
 than any other beast of the field

664
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,880
 that the Lord God had made.

665
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
 And he said to the woman,

666
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,960
 'Did God actually say,

667
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,320
 you shall not eat of any tree in the garden?'

668
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
 And the woman said to the serpent,

669
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,320
 'We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,

670
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,400
 but God said, you should not eat of the fruit of the tree

671
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,240
 that is in the midst of the garden,

672
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,400
 neither shall you touch it lest you die.'

673
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,720
 But the serpent said to the woman,

674
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,600
 'You will not surely die for God knows

675
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,720
 that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened

676
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
 and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.'

677
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food,

678
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,480
 that it was a delight to the eyes,

679
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,

680
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,880
 she took of its fruit and ate.

681
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,480
 And she also gave some to her husband who was with her

682
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,760
 and he ate.

683
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,880
 And then the eyes of both were opened

684
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,320
 and they knew that they were naked

685
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,120
 and they sewed fig leaves together

686
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,040
 and made themselves loincloths."

687
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,240
 Here's what I want you to know.

688
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,760
 God's design for Adam and Eve looks like this.

689
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,200
 He created the world, the world was very good.

690
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,560
 And he said, "Adam, Eve, here's the garden of Eden.

691
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,720
 There is fruit for days.

692
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,680
 There is so much for you to enjoy.

693
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,120
 This is a paradise on earth.

694
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
 This is the pad.

695
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,800
 You have everything your soul needs right here.

696
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,720
 I've given you a helper and a wife.

697
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,600
 You guys get to have so much fun.

698
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,520
 Here's it all."

699
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,760
 And you would think they would be like,

700
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
 "What more do I need?"

701
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,840
 Like us, a lot of us are like,

702
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,280
 "If I just get to marriage,

703
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,720
 I'll be saying, 'What more do I need?

704
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,880
 I finally got it.

705
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
 If I just get a significant other, finally, now I'm here.

706
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,680
 Now I'm satisfied.'"

707
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,840
 And you would think that's what they would,

708
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,720
 that would happen, right?

709
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,680
 But all of a sudden,

710
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,920
 they, the enemy comes like he does to us

711
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,680
 and he starts whispering these lies in their ears.

712
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,600
 And he starts telling them, "Hey, didn't,

713
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,640
 why do you think God is keeping that one tree from you?

714
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
 Why do you think that is?"

715
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,200
 And he starts to get you to reevaluate God's goodness

716
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,560
 and God's character.

717
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,720
 And he goes, "I think God's withholding something from you.

718
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,800
 I think God's keeping you back from something."

719
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,680
 You know, he doesn't want you to like have a perfect,

720
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,400
 like good life in paradise.

721
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,680
 No, he wants you to not be like he is.

722
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,760
 That's why he's keeping it from you.

723
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,520
 And I think we, in the back of our minds,

724
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,720
 might believe God is withholding a relationship from us,

725
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,320
 like trying to teach us a lesson

726
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
 or trying to take us through some hardship.

727
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,440
 And we start to twist God's design.

728
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
 And where God's design is, is that he goes,

729
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,320
 "Hey, whether you are single,

730
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,520
 whether you're in a relationship,

731
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,360
 whether you're married,

732
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,040
 whether you're a father or a mother,

733
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,760
 I have specific designs for every single stage of life.

734
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,760
 And I ask one thing that you would trust me

735
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,120
 in every single season, no matter the cost."

736
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,880
 And we don't like that.

737
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,560
 We don't like to necessarily, I know for me,

738
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,520
 like I'm scared to put my trust in things

739
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,840
 that I can't see the end result.

740
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,960
 It's scary to be like,

741
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,920
 "God, what if you want me to be single forever?

742
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,880
 What if?"

743
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,840
 And I have to wrestle with these things.

744
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,600
 And so when I start to see the design

745
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,040
 that God intended for singleness,

746
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,880
 it starts to open up my perspective

747
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,360
 on what God is trying to do in my life in this season.

748
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,560
 And suddenly all the negative feelings,

749
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,000
 all the emotions, all the feelings of loneliness,

750
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
 they slowly start to dwindle.

751
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,520
 And what was once pain is now turning into a greater purpose.

752
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,920
 I'm recognizing, you know what?

753
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,360
 I truly believe, like Paul was saying,

754
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,960
 there will never be more of a time for me as a human

755
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,240
 to connect with God and experience fullness of joy,

756
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,800
 but also to lead people, to help change the world,

757
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,080
 like to connect other people to God,

758
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,120
 to serve my church, to serve people.

759
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,960
 I'm so available in this season.

760
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,520
 And when was that ever a bad thing?

761
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,960
 To be available, to open up my hands to God and say,

762
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,760
 "God, like whatever you is, like whatever you want,

763
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,280
 like I don't really, I want a relationship

764
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,400
 and I don't really know where you're going,

765
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,240
 but like I'm yours."

766
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,960
 And my perspective starts to change.

767
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,560
 And I don't think that the tree,

768
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,400
 like a lot of people ask,

769
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,120
 "Well, then why did God put the tree in the garden?

770
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,640
 Like if he wanted everything to be perfect and very good,

771
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,160
 why did he put that tree there to begin with?

772
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,560
 Why did he put an opportunity for something bad to happen?"

773
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,880
 And I would say what God was doing there,

774
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,000
 it wasn't that, like the tree does not prove

775
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,560
 or disprove God's goodness.

776
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,760
 Like what that tree does is it shows man's lack of trust

777
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
 in God's goodness.

778
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,600
 Like that tree was an opportunity for God to give to man,

779
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,560
 for man to respond to God and say,

780
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,800
 "I'm gonna trust you.

781
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,560
 Even though I'm hearing from the enemy

782
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,520
 that that's gonna offer me more,

783
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,240
 that that tree has fruit for me to bite into

784
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,200
 and it's gonna make me wise and it's desirable.

785
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,440
 Even though I look at relationships on Instagram

786
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,600
 and I see them, it looks like they're thriving,

787
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,480
 which by the way, highlight reel,

788
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
 I won't get off on that tangent.

789
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,920
 When I look at all these different things,

790
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,080
 I think when I get my marriage,

791
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,440
 I'm at Culver Sack with going to church

792
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,680
 and becoming, having my golden doodle and successful job,

793
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,080
 like all of these things,

794
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,760
 when the enemy says,

795
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,240
 "That's the only time you're gonna ever be satisfied,

796
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,600
 I'm gonna trust you, God.

797
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,800
 I'm gonna trust that you say that this is a time."

798
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
 Paul, why would Paul say that?

799
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,880
 "I wish some of you were single like I am single."

800
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,320
 It's because he understood God's design for singleness.

801
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,280
 He understood it.

802
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,240
 When you understand God's design for your singleness,

803
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
 it doesn't mean that God is suddenly like,

804
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
 "Okay, now that you understand, here's a marriage."

805
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
 It's not like that.

806
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,320
 But you will start to experience his promises.

807
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,240
 You'll start to experience peace and comfort

808
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,040
 and confidence and purpose.

809
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
 We're gonna start to experience what it looks like

810
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,520
 to stop striving and trying and to start trusting

811
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,120
 and resting and reading and learning and changing and doing.

812
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,560
 And we start to be more available.

813
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,960
 And oh my gosh, now I can go do this.

814
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
 I can travel.

815
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
 I can tell more people about Jesus.

816
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,120
 I can read more of the Bible.

817
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,160
 I can pray more.

818
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,240
 I can do more.

819
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,600
 And when you start to see it like this,

820
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,040
 suddenly singleness does not look so bad

821
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,240
 because it's like the time is now.

822
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,640
 We just studied the whole story of Esther

823
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,480
 where he looks at her and he's like,

824
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,680
 "Hey, maybe for such a time as this."

825
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,080
 And I'm looking at you and I'm saying,

826
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,120
 "Maybe for such a time as this,

827
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,920
 God has you single in this season,

828
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,040
 in the unique season of Corona."

829
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,120
 Because he's going, "I want you to be so secure,

830
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,600
 so undistracted and devoted to me that when Corona ends,

831
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,280
 you are literally gonna go and change your world.

832
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,440
 You're gonna go and through this security

833
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,960
 and through what you're learning in this season,

834
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,600
 you're gonna go and it's gonna impact people

835
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,960
 when we get back to normal life.

836
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,520
 Just you wait, just you trust."

837
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,280
 And I know that when I start to think about these things

838
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,920
 and I start to read about these things,

839
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,960
 a couple of verses, like when it's really hard for me,

840
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,680
 I'm like, "Oh my God, I just saw another,

841
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,320
 a couple posts and all this stuff."

842
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,640
 They're starting to do a couple of challenges,

843
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,160
 they're getting bored.

844
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,720
 I go to some of these scriptures, Romans 8, 28, it says,

845
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,360
 "And we know that for those who love God,

846
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 all things work together for good,

847
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,960
 for those who are called according to his purpose."

848
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,440
 First Peter 5, 7 says,

849
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,800
 "Cast all your anxieties on him because he cares for you."

850
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,520
 Ecclesiastes 3, go read it.

851
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,800
 It just talks about how God has designed

852
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,280
 a time for everything.

853
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,360
 There is so much truth found in God's word

854
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,000
 to combat the lies of the enemy,

855
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,040
 that there's something better in the next season of life.

856
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,360
 And I'm telling you, the time is now.

857
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,600
 God wants to, he wants you to be secure in him

858
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,720
 and he wants you to understand and trust his design.

859
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,640
 And when you do that,

860
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,040
 your singleness is gonna do nothing but thrive and succeed.

861
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,000
 And so I'll wrap up with this.

862
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,600
 I know for me, I can hear these things

863
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,520
 and I can write this talk and I can get all fired up

864
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,960
 and I can be like, "Oh my gosh, I'm gonna go."

865
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,960
 And like, "Let's change the world, like singles unite."

866
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,480
 And, but the moment this live stream is over,

867
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
 I drive home and I'm left with nothing but my thoughts.

868
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,280
 And I'm evaluating myself and I'm wondering,

869
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,440
 did that land, was that part confusing?

870
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,160
 And I'm thinking about all these things

871
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,400
 and I have no one to go home.

872
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,360
 Like I don't have a spouse to go home and process to.

873
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,920
 Like tonight I'm gonna lay in my bed

874
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,960
 and think about all these things.

875
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
 And it's gonna just be me and the Lord giving it to him.

876
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,760
 But man, would it be nice to look over and be like,

877
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,080
 "What'd you think, sweetie?"

878
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,560
 Like that would be nice.

879
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,400
 And so I'm telling you like, wherever you are right now,

880
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,960
 I know the live stream is gonna end

881
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,760
 and you're gonna be left back into silence

882
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,560
 with nothing but your thoughts of potential depression,

883
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,280
 anxiety, addiction, loneliness.

884
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
 Like a lot of guys right now,

885
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,360
 you're gonna be left with nothing but the fight of like,

886
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,920
 "Dude, these passions are raging.

887
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,840
 "I just, ah, I know.

888
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,640
 "Like I know all of that is still waiting for you

889
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,680
 "at the other end of this live stream."

890
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
 And so I just wanna tell you, I get it.

891
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,000
 And just really quick, last summer,

892
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,280
 I took the plunge, I moved to Dallas,

893
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,920
 but I did not know that that would result

894
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
 in me losing my two-year relationship.

895
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,160
 And me and my girlfriend, we broke up.

896
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,440
 I'm like, "Okay, God, I'm gonna trust you.

897
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,280
 "I'm gonna trust you.

898
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,360
 "I'm gonna move to Dallas still."

899
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,720
 I moved to Dallas.

900
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,480
 I'm starting the Watermark Institute.

901
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,000
 It's the Bible program here for 10 months.

902
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,360
 And then God's like, "Hey, JD,

903
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,280
 "I want you to give undistracted, devoted attention to me

904
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,120
 "in these 10 months.

905
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,920
 "Can you commit to being single for 10 months?"

906
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,480
 And I'm like, "Okay."

907
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,400
 But even though I'm in Dallas with a lot of new people

908
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,360
 and the Metroplex like, "Okay, God,

909
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,720
 "I'm yours for 10 months."

910
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,880
 And now I'm nearing the end of the 10 months

911
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,400
 and May is coming.

912
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,320
 And I think at first along the way, it's like,

913
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,560
 we're at April and I'm at this crossroad

914
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,280
 where I'm like wanting to like speed up the process

915
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,840
 and get out of the singleness.

916
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,560
 And I think a lot of it is 'cause I could not

917
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,480
 have expected quarantine and coronavirus

918
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,800
 and all of this to happen.

919
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,120
 And I am like, "Get me out.

920
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,200
 "I am so tired of being alone.

921
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,960
 "Whatever it takes, get me out."

922
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,320
 Because here's what I'm left with in these lonely moments.

923
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,320
 I have to wake up and ask myself, "I am super alone."

924
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,280
 All my best friends from college have a group text

925
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,760
 I'm in every day where they're all married

926
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,320
 and they're all in their first round of children.

927
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,040
 And I'm thinking these thoughts like I'm behind,

928
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,760
 like all their kids are gonna grow up

929
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,280
 and I don't even have a girlfriend.

930
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,600
 I'm so far behind, like vacations, all of that.

931
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,920
 I'm gonna be that weird single guy playing with the kids.

932
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
 And they're like, "That's your uncle, JD."

933
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,360
 And it's like, I'm not really their uncle.

934
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,240
 And my little brother, like he's in a marriage

935
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,200
 for a couple of years now.

936
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,960
 My older sister's married with kids.

937
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,800
 My mom is about to get married again.

938
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,560
 Everyone is married.

939
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,040
 And I sit at home and I'm like, you know what that means?

940
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,720
 That means that they're all committed to someone

941
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,080
 and that person is their top priority.

942
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,320
 And I sit there and I'm like, "But whose priority am I?"

943
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,960
 Like, I feel so alone at times.

944
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,400
 And I'm like, "I am no one's priority until I am married.

945
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,840
 I will have no one who is so about me, so for me,

946
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,280
 just wants me all the time."

947
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,160
 And I believe deep down that when I find that person,

948
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,280
 I'm finally gonna be satisfied and not feel so lonely.

949
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,120
 But I'm missing the point because in this time,

950
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,520
 God has been so kind to me to be like,

951
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,200
 "Hey, you're not alone."

952
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,080
 And as cliche as it sounds, I've actually recognized

953
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,400
 I'm in a very committed relationship

954
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,840
 with the God of the universe, the creator,

955
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,480
 the maker of my days,

956
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,880
 the person who calls me my friend and my father.

957
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,400
 And he says, "I am committed to you.

958
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,960
 I want all this devoted time with you.

959
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
 I'm crazy obsessed about you.

960
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,640
 You're a top priority in my life.

961
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
 JD, you're such a priority that I'm willing to send

962
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,320
 my one and only son, Jesus, to come down to where you are

963
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,600
 and to pay the penalty of your sin and death

964
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,520
 and die on a cross.

965
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,680
 And why did I send him to do that, JD?

966
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,200
 So that you and I would never have to be separated.

967
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,720
 So that we could be in a relationship

968
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,200
 that brings you fullness of joy and peace

969
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,520
 and purpose and satisfaction.

970
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,320
 We can be in that forever.

971
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,760
 You're in a relationship with the person

972
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,120
 who fully knows you and fully loves you.

973
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,960
 Why?

974
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,320
 Because I sent my son to make it so

975
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,280
 through his death, burial, and resurrection.

976
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,560
 And when Jesus Christ died for me,

977
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,200
 when he rose from the grave and conquered sin's penalty

978
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,960
 and loneliness and depression and anxiety,

979
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,360
 when he conquered all of that,

980
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,640
 it meant that I now get to wake up every day

981
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,720
 and find security in the right relationship with Jesus.

982
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,720
 I get to have undistracted, devoted time with him

983
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,520
 because my security's in him.

984
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,920
 And then I get to trust in the design

985
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,480
 that God has a purpose and a plan for this season

986
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,040
 of my life, just like he had a plan

987
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,840
 to send his son to die for me.

988
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,720
 And I wake up every day and I remind myself,

989
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,880
 hey, no matter how lonely you feel,

990
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,560
 God loves you and God is with you, JD.

991
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,400
 He's with you.

992
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,240
 And to my friends listening right now,

993
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,560
 I know you're lonely.

994
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,440
 And I know that it just seems like

995
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,400
 if I can just get out of this,

996
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,840
 all of this will go away.

997
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,480
 But I'm here to tell you that's just not true.

998
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,880
 And God has this season.

999
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,280
 I specifically think God wants this season of Corona

1000
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,200
 for us to open up the word,

1001
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,000
 spend time with him and recognize and believe and trust

1002
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,920
 that, hey, everything you're searching for is with me.

1003
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,280
 Nothing else, nothing else.

1004
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,440
 You can come and just be with me

1005
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,600
 and I will satisfy the deepest longings of your soul.

1006
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 God, I am so thankful that although I am so prone to doubt,

1007
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,720
 so prone to fear and reject this season,

1008
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,560
 that I am so quick to not believe

1009
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,920
 that you're trying to work out something for my good.

1010
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,920
 I'm so quick to doubt that you designed singleness,

1011
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,600
 that you designed this season of my life,

1012
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
 just like you designed every other season of life.

1013
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,880
 And you want amazing things for me.

1014
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,960
 You want me to be devoted to you.

1015
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,600
 I'm so sorry for when I'm so prone to doubt that

1016
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,680
 and run from that.

1017
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,680
 And for my friends that are battling loneliness,

1018
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,560
 are battling trying to rush out of this season

1019
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,400
 because they don't believe like I, that you're enough.

1020
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,320
 I pray that tonight,

1021
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,720
 that this season would change our lives.

1022
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,360
 That when life goes back to normal,

1023
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,240
 when we are back to whatever the new normal is,

1024
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,720
 when we are back to whatever the new normal

1025
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,640
 is gonna look like, that we go sprinting in,

1026
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,560
 not trying to sprint out of our singleness,

1027
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,920
 but trying to sprint into your design,

1028
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,320
 into your purpose, into your plan,

1029
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,480
 trusting I don't know when the season is gonna end,

1030
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,280
 but I trust that it's gonna be good

1031
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,320
 because my creator, my father said so.

1032
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,640
 And it's him that I wanna be with

1033
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,520
 more than anyone else or anything else.

1034
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,960
 So that is why we come in this moment.

1035
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,960
 We open up our hands and surrender our life to your design,

1036
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,280
 our father and our friend.

1037
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,800
 In the name that I pray, amen.

1038
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,040
 Let's respond in worship.
