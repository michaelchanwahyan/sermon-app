[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:31.480]   All right.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.620]   All right.
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.660]   Welcome to the porch.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.540]   Hey, help me welcome my friends all across the nation.
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.220]   We got the Porch Live, Austin, Texas, Midland, Texas,
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.220]   Indianapolis, Indiana, Greater Lafayette, Indiana, Boise,
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.180]   and Scottsdale.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.540]   And there's a whole host of more.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.660]   Help me welcome my friends all across the nation.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.180]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.700]   And of course, my friends right here in Dallas.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.140]   Anybody watch the Super Bowl?
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.780]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.280]   Chiefs!
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.160]   [CHEERING]
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.320]   Hey, hey.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.480]   I'm not a bandwagon.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.360]   I lived in Kansas City almost eight years,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.160]   moved to Dallas 3 and 1/2 years ago,
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.360]   but grew up in the motherland right here in Texas.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.560]   Let's make that clear.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.080]   No, I love the Super Bowl.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.160]   Like, I love it.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.920]   Like, I love a lot about the Super Bowl.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.840]   I love the fact that there's two teams, the best
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.240]   two teams of the year.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.120]   They're facing off, and you hope to be this epic showdown,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.080]   right?
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.360]   Like, I love the food.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.800]   Anybody, like, just a foodie?
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.600]   Like, I'm a foodie.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.360]   Got to watch what I eat, because, you know,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.200]   I'll just go to town.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.760]   Like, there's all kinds of food at Super Bowl parties.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.840]   And, you know, I love the commercials.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.000]   You know, you never know what's coming, right?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.640]   Better guard your eyes, man.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.360]   But I love the creativity of commercials.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.240]   I love the halftime.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.680]   Some of you, you thought the main show was Rihanna.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.720]   You still don't know the score of the game.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.960]   Oh, somebody, somebody excited about Rihanna.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.840]   The halftime show.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440]   But here's what I like the most.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.400]   I love the fact that the Super Bowl brings people together.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.080]   Like, your friends, like, maybe coworkers, neighbors,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.760]   you know, just people, you know, in church.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   Like, it just brings people together.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.720]   And, you know, let me just show you a pic of my people.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.600]   That's my people.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.360]   So this is who I watch the Super Bowl with, right?
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.440]   This is my crew, my people.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.760]   I got my kids.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   I got the best man of my wedding, my boy JD, his wife,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.520]   and, you know, best man of my wedding's wife.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.760]   Like, we just had a blast together.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.000]   And, you know, what I know about that picture
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.720]   is that picture, the people in that picture,
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720]   they're way more important than the game itself
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.880]   and everything that surrounds the Super Bowl
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.560]   because they're a part of my community.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.960]   And when I think about this word community,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.080]   there's these two root words that come to mind,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.360]   commune and then unity.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.760]   And so community is this idea that you commune,
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.440]   you gather with people around something
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.600]   that you're unified on.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.960]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.520]   Like an event or a place.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.760]   So say it'd be the Super Bowl, a birthday,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.600]   maybe it's the gym, you know, happy hour,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.840]   your coffee shop, like that coffee shop,
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.680]   maybe it's Merritt, I don't know what your coffee shop is
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.960]   in Indianapolis, but it's your coffee shop.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.240]   And then you gather with your people,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.320]   like it might be a coworker, a friend, a neighbor,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.720]   it might be a date.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.160]   And then it's, you know, you're doing some type of activity,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.280]   you're grabbing a meal together, you're eating,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.080]   you're grabbing some drinks together,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.520]   you're working out, you're going on that first day.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.640]   Like some of you came in this place,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.960]   you're like, man, I hope I get that first date tonight.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.480]   You know, and I would just say, you men,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.040]   hey, shoot your shot, bro, if you're in it, you know,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.800]   if you're in the game and the game is Christianity,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.560]   like you're following Jesus, you're healthy, go for it, man.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.200]   Some of y'all need to step up anyways.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.360]   So that's your encouragement.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.600]   But no, this is what I mean.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.320]   Here's why I say that.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.480]   Because if we had to be honest tonight,
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.640]   like our community is comparable
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.600]   to what we had on Sunday night.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.320]   It starts and ends with just that.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.000]   Like the things that maybe you do,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.400]   if you had to be honest tonight,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.800]   it just starts and it ends with only that.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   That thing you do with the people that you gather with,
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.360]   the people that you're unified with.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.160]   We were created for so much more.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.360]   Although this type of community isn't bad in and of itself,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.080]   it's not the only thing we were created to do.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.720]   Like we were created for deep, intimate relationships.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.160]   And like, you know this to be true,
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.080]   like don't you like,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.000]   how come the moment you leave that social event,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.320]   you're hit with a wave of loneliness?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.920]   You have this social anxiety,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.400]   maybe sometimes when you're in the crowd.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.720]   Or you are filled with anxiety,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.840]   like you have a lot of acquaintances,
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.040]   but you go home and you're just plagued with this anxiety
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.720]   that so much so you have to take sleeping pills
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.760]   just to go to sleep.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.480]   Or when you're around those so-called friends,
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.600]   like something about that group
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.960]   doesn't really sit well with you
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.920]   because they don't know the true you.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.600]   Like they still don't know you.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.960]   No one really knows you.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.880]   Could it be that the way that we're doing community
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.680]   is not at all how God intended for us?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.120]   In the quietness of your own heart,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.000]   I just want you to ask yourself these questions, okay?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.960]   Just do an evaluation of where you are right now
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.920]   with your people.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   Who in this world really knows you?
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.360]   With whom in this world are you fully known,
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.800]   but also fully loved?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.080]   Who in this world knows your positive qualities,
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.160]   yet they get to see behind the curtain of your life,
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.120]   and they see your insecurities?
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.160]   They see your hangups,
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.200]   your unhealthy tendencies, your weaknesses.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.040]   With whom in the world are you fully known and fully loved?
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.920]   See, God has wired us with deep-meaning relationships
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.760]   with each other.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.480]   Unfortunately, many of us, we just go through life,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.040]   and we never really experience this.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.240]   So maybe we even settle for isolation.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.640]   Like some of you, man,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.240]   you just wanted to be at a Super Bowl party,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.480]   but the Super Bowl just reminded you that you're alone.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.360]   Or you come into a place like this,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.440]   and there's just a big place,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.680]   and there's a lot of young adults,
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.560]   and yeah, you got some acquaintances,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.760]   but you don't really have your people.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.920]   And listen, we can escape these feelings of being alone
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.840]   because today we come into this place,
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.000]   and it just happens to be Valentine's Day
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.840]   on a Tuesday night.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.120]   Gosh, the last thing I needed to be reminded of
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.840]   was maybe I'm alone.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.280]   And so tonight, I wanna talk to you
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.600]   not about dating.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.680]   Many of you probably come into this place thinking,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.920]   not about your singleness.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.680]   Maybe you thought we were going singleness route.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.240]   Not about sex, not about that relationship
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.600]   that you're thinking about, that dating relationship.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.440]   No, I wanna talk to you
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.040]   about the most important relationship
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.760]   outside of your relationship with Christ,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.280]   and that's the relationship that you have with,
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   if you're a guy, man,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.040]   those are the closest men in your life.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.840]   If you're a woman, those are the closest ladies
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.480]   that you're rolling up your sleeves with,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.240]   that you're really doing life with,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.160]   that you're spending time with.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.280]   I'm talking about your gathering.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.720]   I'm talking about this sense of community
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.880]   that you don't just gather around a place
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.540]   and the people and the activity.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.200]   I'm talking about you gathering
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.960]   around authentic relationships
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.560]   that actually lead to spiritual transformation.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.700]   Do you have that in your life tonight?
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.200]   We're gonna be in the book of Genesis,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.620]   the very first book of the Bible.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.460]   So if you have your Bible,
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.420]   feel free to open it to the book of Genesis.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.260]   If you don't, that's cool.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.140]   We want that to be our gift to you.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.820]   You can head out to the town center after the service
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.660]   and just go to the welcome desk
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.980]   and just say, "Hey, I would love to have
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.820]   "a copy of God's word.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.940]   "I would love a physical copy of that."
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.420]   And so tonight we're gonna be in the book of Genesis,
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.700]   the very first book of the Bible,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.100]   and then we're gonna be in chapter two,
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.820]   starting in verse 18.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.100]   Y'all remember what God said to Adam
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.780]   before he made Eve?
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.980]   This is what he says in verse 18.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.420]   The Lord God said, "It is not good for man to be,"
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.260]   come on, come on.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.940]   - Alone. - Alone.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.140]   Alone, someone's fired up down here, thank you.
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.300]   Yeah, he said, "It's not good for man to be alone."
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.460]   Like the first point of tonight's message is,
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.880]   you're called to community, called to community.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.220]   God calls us to community.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.420]   He said it, "It's not good for man to be alone."
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.860]   And I think the most natural way to apply this statement
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.020]   is to marriage, but I don't think it's just true
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.460]   about marriage, I think it's just true
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.660]   about life in general.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.260]   It's not good for you and I to be alone,
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:27.100]   right now, in this moment, whether you're married or not.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.100]   And you see this rhythm, like in Genesis one,
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.820]   one chapter before where God's creating
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.620]   and he says it's good, and he creates
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.620]   and he says it's good, and he does this six times
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.020]   over the course of six days,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.180]   and on the seventh day, he rests.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.500]   And so there's this incredible place of perfection,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.780]   there's this paradise, and God just finished
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.300]   creating everything, and he created Adam,
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.180]   and sin hadn't come into existence yet,
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.340]   and Adam is ruling over everything that God created
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.900]   in this one-on-one harmonious relationship
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.740]   which is Adam and God.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.740]   And it feels like there should be this amazing connection,
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.020]   but then something interrupts the creation story
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.660]   and God says what?
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.140]   He says it's not good for man to be alone.
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.140]   Like what could be wrong with perfection
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.100]   after God created?
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.340]   Being alone was the very first thing in all creation.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.460]   I know I'm drilling down on this point,
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.660]   but we have to start here.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.580]   This is the foundation in which we're building
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.300]   the entire message around tonight.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.220]   I find this to be fascinating 'cause nothing is fallen yet.
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.260]   Everything is perfect, and you know,
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.340]   I talk to men every single week and they're just like,
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.220]   I'm good, man, just Jesus and I.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.580]   Like I'm straight, like it's good,
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.340]   like him and I, I don't really need his people,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.380]   I don't really need the church,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.220]   and although that might sound good in theory,
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.760]   the Bible would just say that that's not true.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.100]   It's not true.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.140]   Psalm 92, 13 says those who are planted
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.580]   in the house of the Lord shall what?
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.820]   What's the promise there?
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.180]   It's not rhetorical.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.740]   Shall what?
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.140]   Shall flourish.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.960]   Do we have that up there?
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.020]   Yeah, shall flourish.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.220]   And so the way that you and I flourish in this life
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.140]   is to be planted in the house of God,
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.860]   doing life, connected, embracing people
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.180]   that maybe don't look like you or dress like you,
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.700]   or have the same hobbies as you,
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.140]   but you know what they have?
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:32.580]   Point North is focused straight on Christ.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.060]   It's this idea of solitary confinement.
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.900]   Like people in prison, man,
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.580]   they dread the punishment of solitary confinement.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.000]   Like it's one of the worst things that you can do
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.140]   for a person in prison.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.100]   Like one person said, being locked up in a place
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.200]   where you have zero human interaction with others
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.880]   literally psychologically destroys them.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.340]   It cuts them off from the rest of the world.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.260]   Another person said keeping prisoners totally isolated
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.540]   from the living world comes dangerously close
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.100]   to the penal tomb.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.740]   In other words, it's a slow death.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.580]   And listen, you know, you're not in a prison
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.320]   of solitary confinement tonight,
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.460]   but you might be in a prison of loneliness.
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.740]   You might be in a prison of anxiety, depression,
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.980]   pornography, alcohol, a prison of lying or cheating,
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.900]   or, you know, a prison of just gossiping.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.740]   Like you just gossip because you just want
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.340]   to be elevated in this life.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.020]   And when you do that, it just makes you look better
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.120]   than the other person.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:42.100]   And I would just say,
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.660]   if we stay in those prisons
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.980]   and we never connect with God's people,
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.060]   then it's gonna be hard to get out.
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.860]   Here's the other truth in this room.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.620]   Like some of us, we're just comfortable in that prison.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.880]   Like we kind of like it.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.400]   Like we've just grown numb to it.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.960]   And it's just like what we do.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.200]   And God said, it's not good.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.640]   There's Proverbs 14, 12 says,
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.040]   "There's a way that seems right to man,
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.320]   "but that way ends in death."
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.680]   And some of you tonight, you don't even know it,
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.780]   but you're slowly dying.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:21.560]   And God has you on this day, Valentine's 2023,
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.680]   to hear a message that hopefully might change
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.880]   the trajectory of your life for all of eternity.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.600]   And not just all of eternity, but for now.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.760]   Some of you are like, "Josiah, I got relationships.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.880]   "I got the people in my life."
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.760]   But let me ask you something.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.640]   Are they the right people?
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.800]   Are they the people that you can lock arms with
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.000]   that are gonna sharpen you and encourage you
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.600]   and challenge you in your faith?
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.260]   Bible says it like this in 2 Corinthians 6, 14,
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.020]   "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.160]   "For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common?
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.280]   "Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?"
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:04.040]   So when the Bible says not to be yoked with unbelievers,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.000]   it doesn't mean you quit spending time with unbelievers.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.860]   Like that would be insanity.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.880]   Like that would be impossible for you to, you know,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.540]   share the gospel with them, point them to Christ,
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.480]   and just encourage and influence them.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.960]   That's not what it's talking about, but it's saying,
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.420]   hey, where do you spend your closest time?
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.580]   And who do you spend your closest time with?
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.760]   Where are those places?
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.600]   Where are those people?
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.660]   And what kind of activities are you doing?
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.440]   Are they stirring your affection for Christ?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.240]   Or are they drowning that out to a point where you just
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.880]   kind of said, hey, man, it is what it is.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.080]   This is just life.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:50.040]   And you're just kind of on the treadmill of stupidity.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.360]   Like a dog returns to his vomit, the scripture says,
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.720]   a fool returns to his folly,
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.900]   and you have no one there to pick you up when you fall.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.180]   You have no one there to be a truth teller.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.580]   They just tell you what you want to hear.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.080]   They don't tell you what you need to hear.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.280]   22 years of my life, that's how I spent it.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:13.720]   Here's what I know, man.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.440]   The more we spend time with the wrong community,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.680]   you catch the symptoms of those you run with.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.600]   You tracking?
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   Like you wonder why you can't defeat the sin in your life.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.000]   It's because the people you hang out with entertain that.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.320]   You wonder why you listen to what you listen to,
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.880]   you go where you go, you do what you do,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.560]   you drink that, you smoke that,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.880]   you hook up with that person,
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.680]   because that's just what you do.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.700]   That's just your people.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.160]   That's just who you guys hang out.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.240]   That's what y'all, that's what you spend your time doing.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.600]   And God's saying, "Hey, you keep doing what you're doing.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.460]   "You're not gonna change.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.500]   "But if you keep doing what you're doing,
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.200]   "you're not gonna like it at the end of the day.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.840]   "It's gonna lead to bondage.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.260]   "It's going to lead to death."
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.660]   Like I feel for some of you,
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.580]   because there's actually people trying to pursue
[00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.680]   the right kind of community,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.780]   but part of the reason why your community
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.660]   might not be hitting right,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.000]   because in 2023, it's harder and harder to know
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440]   who's actually following Jesus.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.000]   Like I like the Superbowl, man, it just makes it easy.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.180]   Who's cheering for the Chiefs,
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.700]   who's cheering for the Eagles,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.980]   or really any sport events, right?
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.680]   Because you got the jersey.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.360]   I mean, I was repping that Patrick Mahomes,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.840]   number 15 jersey, like let's go, right?
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.140]   And so that's just, man, I was repping that.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.580]   Like people knew who I was cheering for, right?
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.740]   You know, people, like there's just so many distinctions.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.400]   You got your chants, right?
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.800]   The city that you're from, or you know,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.340]   whatever that thing is, there's just so many distinctions
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.340]   that separate people on who they're cheering for.
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.320]   But when it comes to the things of Christ,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.040]   like it's just so blurry in 2023.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.460]   You got the cultural Christianity,
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.680]   you got the soft preaching,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.660]   you got people who won't share the hard truths of Scripture.
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.620]   And so people just think that they can continue
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:13.640]   to do what they're doing,
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.560]   and there's no ramifications for their sin.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.020]   It's a mess.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.860]   And God's saying, hey, there's hope.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.280]   When you look at this book, it's your compass,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.360]   it's your guide.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.420]   Like you know what I'm talking about, man.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.620]   You dated someone who said they're a Christian,
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.580]   and they were taking you out,
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.380]   but then they began to, you know,
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.340]   mismanage information about you,
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.180]   and they began to manipulate you,
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.220]   and they weren't the godly example
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.460]   that you thought they were, Bio's lie, right?
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.500]   Like you listen to what they said with their lips,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.300]   but you didn't watch how they lived their life.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:56.660]   And you're holding that against God.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.540]   And God's like, man, you,
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:05.500]   greatest test of time is you just observing their life.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.140]   Like that's the greatest test,
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.440]   is you watching their life over a period of time.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.540]   You know that person that was lukewarm,
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.060]   and maybe he invited you to church,
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.180]   and you came to church, right?
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.140]   And you were kind of cold,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.160]   like just kind of dead to the things of God,
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.340]   but then you started getting on fire for the things of God,
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.620]   and then you started calling out that person
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.860]   that was lukewarm, and they didn't like it, right?
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.020]   And you're like, man, why are you getting mad at me, bro?
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.980]   I'm just pointing you to the truth,
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.860]   the place that you brought me to.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:40.220]   Or maybe you grew up in a family
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.020]   that sat in the pew Sunday after Sunday,
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.880]   but then when you jumped in the car,
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.660]   it was like all hell broke loose.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:51.180]   Like, did you even hear what they were saying?
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.880]   And bro, it just sends you spiraling.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.920]   2023, man, is a mess.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.980]   It's hard to figure out who's in and who's not.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.580]   It's getting harder and harder to know
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.260]   who's worth locking arms with, and I get that.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.060]   So in 2023, here at The Porch, man,
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.340]   we've made a commitment to make a big place
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.380]   feel really, really small.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.060]   Like, we wanna help filter the people
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.480]   that wanna go all in and still create a space
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.860]   for people to come examine the evidence of Christ
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.660]   and love the people that aren't fully bought in
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.260]   and wanna commit their life to Jesus.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.620]   Like, that will always be what marks The Porch,
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.040]   but we also wanna create a place
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.140]   for people who wants to go all in,
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.060]   and so what we do is we stand up here every week,
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.000]   and we just said, hey, there's gonna be a team of people
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.220]   down here up front in the front of the stage
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.140]   that would love to talk to you,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.300]   whether you're a skeptic
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.200]   or whether you're a seasoned believer.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.660]   We've created another environment up in the loft.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.140]   You just go up the town center,
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.660]   go up the stairs in the loft, and it's called Next Steps,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.380]   and that's just a place to help you discover
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.100]   what is your next step, community, serving, membership,
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.020]   and then there's a process where you can go
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.480]   and you can meet other men or other women
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.820]   that are pursuing the same thing you're pursuing
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.500]   and want to gather with other women
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.380]   in a smaller group or other men in a smaller group
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.180]   and wanna start doing life together.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.700]   That's community, and then it's like,
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.260]   do we have a really easy win every week
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.680]   is up in the chapel, where it's like,
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.560]   you go up these stairs, go out those doors,
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.220]   and there's the chapel, and it's just a place
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.620]   for you to process what you just heard and pray,
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.620]   and so there's a lot of different connecting points
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.140]   no matter where you find yourself.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.400]   Once a month, we got great questions
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.940]   where you can go and ask anything.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.020]   Nothing's off limits, and we'll do our best to answer that,
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.900]   and so this is our heart here at the porch
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.260]   that we wanna help get you connected.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.500]   God is calling you to community, and tonight is the night.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.020]   I believe some of you will step into that
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.180]   and experience life and life abundantly.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.660]   Point number two, if you're taking notes,
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.020]   call to confess.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.020]   You're called to confess.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.960]   Like, this is what marks people that are in community,
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.480]   so if you're like, man, I'm in community,
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.420]   and as I'm going throughout this message,
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.540]   you don't hear these things actually playing out
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.860]   in your life, let's talk after the service.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.140]   I'll be down here as long as it takes.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.380]   First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins,
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.820]   "he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.620]   "and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.100]   I love that.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.860]   Like, nobody can out-sin the grace of God.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.540]   It doesn't matter where you've been, what you've done.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.780]   Oh, you don't know my story, just saying,
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.140]   oh, you don't know my story.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.780]   No, if you confess your sin, he's faithful and just
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.400]   to forgive you of all your sin
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.740]   and cleanse you of all unrighteousness.
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.060]   That's your vertical relationship with Jesus.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.740]   I love Psalm 32, three through five.
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.580]   It just says, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.660]   "through my groaning all day long."
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.540]   It's like, hey, man, when you keep silent
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.360]   and you suppress your sin and you don't confess it,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.700]   like, your body gets sick.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.980]   I mean, that's just, I'm just reading the text.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:01.900]   That sounds right.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.620]   I mean, I think that's what it says.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.780]   Verse four, "For day and night, your hand," whose hand?
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.580]   "God's hand was heavy upon me.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.860]   "My strength was dried up as by the heat of the summer."
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.400]   But then it says in verse five, look at their term.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.780]   "I acknowledged my sin to you."
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:19.980]   I didn't cover my iniquity, my sin.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.940]   I said, "I will confess my transgression to the Lord
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.100]   "and you forgave the iniquity of my sin."
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.220]   You know, let me ask, like, have you prayed
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.980]   and asked God to forgive you of your sin?
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.020]   Like, have you recognized,
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.140]   if there have been a time in your life
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.340]   where you recognize, hey, that you are a sinner
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.540]   separated from a holy, perfect God,
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.680]   there's no one righteous, not one.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.820]   The only thing you need to come to God is need.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.280]   Like, so often, we don't even realize we have a need.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.940]   If you're like me, man, I just compared my life
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.340]   to other people, even people in the church,
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.020]   and when I did that, I could always find someone worse
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.380]   than me, which gave me security in the fact that I was,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.740]   gave me security in the fact that I wasn't that bad.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.220]   And so I just kind of did whatever I wanted.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.260]   I can always find someone worse than you.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.100]   You know, that's the mentality
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.960]   that some of us have in this place.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.460]   And God's saying, "Hey, man, there's no one righteous,
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.120]   "no, not one, but my grace is sufficient.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.720]   "My grace can cover that."
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.540]   Like, some of us, man, we've confessed our sin to God,
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.580]   but we're still not experiencing the healing,
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.580]   the victory that comes with that.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.980]   Like, we've done the vertical relationship with God,
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.420]   but outside of that, man,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.040]   we have not confessed that to anyone else.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.960]   Like, we haven't experienced the true healing.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.320]   Like, we've experienced forgiveness,
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.980]   but I always say forgiveness and healing
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.820]   are two different things.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.660]   Like, forgiveness is what you get in 1 John 1:9 in Psalm 32,
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.700]   but healing, look what it says in James 5:16.
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.220]   Therefore, confess your sins one to another.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.300]   That's vertical, or excuse me, that's horizontal.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.660]   That's not vertical, it's horizontal relationships,
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.020]   and pray for one another that you may be what?
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.620]   Come on, what's the promise?
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.200]   Healed.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.040]   Healed.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.140]   The prayer of a righteous person has great power
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.140]   as it is working.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.100]   See, the best version of you and I exists
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.540]   on the other side of community, the most healed,
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.940]   the most whole version of you and I exists
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.720]   on the other side of community.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.320]   It's where you share and confess those dark areas
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.220]   of your heart.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.700]   So many Christians are forgiven of their sin
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.740]   because they pray and ask Jesus to forgive them
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.660]   of their sin, but they're not walking in full heal,
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.140]   healness, they're not walking in complete victory
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.420]   because they've suppressed their sin
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.200]   instead of addressing it, instead of sharing that
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   with people that are either men of integrity
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.420]   or women of integrity, either men that can be trusted
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.580]   or women that can be trusted.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.080]   Do you have that in your life?
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.460]   There's some of us that we know this to be true.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.460]   Like we have made a declaration to ourself
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.820]   that there's things in our life that were taken
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.620]   to the grave and I'm not going to let anyone
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.220]   know about that thing.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.220]   And God's saying, okay, well then it's going to be
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.900]   really hard for you to experience complete healing.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.140]   There's things that you said, I'm just going to go
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.380]   to the grave and I'm not going to let anyone know about it.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.460]   And I would just say, hey, the power of sin
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.140]   is always in secrecy.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:30.100]   If you want sin's power to weaken,
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.980]   then you'll begin to confess it.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.800]   That's what he's called us to do tonight
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.080]   is to confess that sin one to another.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.820]   The power of sin grows strength when it's suppressed,
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.740]   when it's in darkness.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.620]   But if you want that sin to be weakened,
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.660]   then you'll confess it.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.180]   Several months ago, my wife, Kathy and I,
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.820]   when you saw in the picture, we got in a pretty big
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.580]   argument, like we just, you know, we weren't seeing eye
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.820]   to eye with some things and, you know,
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.260]   we weren't necessarily angry at one another.
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.620]   And the Bible says, do not let the sun go down
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.060]   in your anger, but it doesn't say, hey,
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.380]   you can't let the sun go down on your conflict, right?
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.500]   So I was like, all right, man, we just need to go to bed.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.340]   Right?
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.160]   So we're just going to go to bed.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.700]   We'll put this on the shelf and we'll come back
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.120]   and address this tomorrow morning.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.820]   So she goes to bed and I kind of, you know,
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.700]   stewing a little bit.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.000]   I'm not angry, I'm just frustrated that we,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.220]   that we're just in this conflict.
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.380]   We can't, we can't seem to get eye to eye.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.620]   We can't seem to talk and to work through it
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.680]   and to be like-minded in this issue.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.780]   And so in that moment, I just felt tempted
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.620]   to look at pornography.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.340]   Like the temptation became so strong in that moment.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.700]   And I had a choice.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.780]   I could pick up my phone and I could text out the men
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.580]   that I've been talking about tonight that,
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.020]   that, hey, I gather with and I can say,
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.380]   hey, hey fellas, listen, listen, listen.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.060]   There's this temptation that's come over me.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.500]   I know what I need to do.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.360]   I need to flee it, but, but it's,
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.580]   but I'm fighting it right now.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.260]   And I, and I, and I want to click on that.
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.380]   I want to go to that website.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.760]   I want to go to this social media handle.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.700]   So I'm sure you're already sleeping, but when you see this,
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.020]   well, you asked me when you wake up,
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.860]   if I won the battle tomorrow morning,
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:21.140]   and I reconciled with my wife and by God's grace,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.340]   I won the battle over lust, porn.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.840]   And by God's grace, we reconciled with my wife.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.200]   You know what it did in that moment with my wife?
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.220]   You know what it did in that moment?
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.260]   It, sin's power began to weaken.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:40.260]   But the moment that you decide, hey,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.140]   I'm just going to kind of fight this on my own.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.580]   And I got this.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.020]   You're done, man.
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.860]   You're toast.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.440]   Like some of us, like we just wait to confess things
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.660]   on an action level when God's saying, no, no, no.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.860]   It starts with your mind.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.140]   Sow a thought, reap an action.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.340]   Sow an action, reap a habit.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.660]   Sow a habit, reap character.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.700]   Sow character, reap an entire destiny.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.100]   The battle is always in the mind.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.300]   So what would it look like if thousands of young adults
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   all over the nation that are listening to this tonight
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.340]   decided, hey, I'm not just going to confess
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.180]   on the action level.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.500]   I'm going to start confessing on a thought level
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.220]   when the temptation hits me.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.740]   Do you have men like that?
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.700]   Do you have women like that?
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.980]   And some of you are like, man, I ain't doing that.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.380]   Like, you don't know, bro.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.680]   Like people are going to mismanage that information about me.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.260]   And I'm just like, well, hey, let them.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.360]   Because you're not defined by people.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.900]   You're defined by the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.140]   And my Bible says that there is therefore now
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.580]   no condemnation for those that are in Christ Jesus.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:43.940]   And so I can confess it.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.080]   Even in this moment, I'm like, man,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.160]   what are they going to think about me?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.260]   The pastor boy, he's got temptations
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.340]   to look at things, I don't really care.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.580]   Because the power is always weakened
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.200]   when you address the sin.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.140]   And so you have a chance tonight
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.680]   to have sin's power weakened.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.260]   Galatians 1.10 says, am I trying to win the approval of men
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.100]   or of God?
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.940]   If I was trying to win the approval of men,
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.140]   I'd never be a servant of Christ.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.660]   I'm not trying to win your approval.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.640]   I'm not trying to win other people's approval,
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   even my community group's approval.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.820]   But by faith, I step out, I send the text.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.540]   Even if I would have gone and fell into that sin,
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.700]   I know how they're going to respond.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.340]   They're going to extend grace and say,
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:32.140]   all right, Josiah, let's talk.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.060]   Let me remind you of Romans 8.1.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.620]   You don't have to live with condemnation.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.220]   You don't have to live with shame and guilt
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.740]   because Christ defeated that when he died on the cross
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.700]   and rose again on the third day.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.700]   That's the power that is available to you and me.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.540]   Do you have that power?
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.180]   Do you have those men?
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.940]   Do you have those women in your life?
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.000]   Tonight's the night where you remove the mask
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.980]   and you show your true self.
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.280]   Like, listen, we come into this place
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.880]   and we're wearing masks.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.220]   Like they're invisible, of course,
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.300]   but they're a mask nonetheless.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.580]   The mask represents hiding.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.620]   It represents shame.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.740]   It represents, I don't want people to see
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.780]   that area of my life.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.420]   And I'm just saying, hey, if you don't remove that tonight,
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.820]   it's going to be hard for you to walk in victory.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.980]   It's going to be hard for you to experience freedom
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.440]   that Christ is offering.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.660]   The mask that I'm not wearing is the four other men
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.540]   in my life that I pursue and they pursue me
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.740]   every single week.
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.300]   These are men that I've grown to love because they know me
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.100]   and they still love the real me.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.680]   No matter where I've been in thought, word and action,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.380]   they open up this book and they say,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.140]   hey, lust, I got a verse for that.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.420]   I got a battle plan for that.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.540]   Anxiety, I got a battle plan for that.
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.280]   Oh, you got a big decision that you need to make?
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.980]   I got a verse for that.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.220]   I got a game plan for that.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.820]   Oh, you're struggling with anger.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.100]   Oh, your tone at home,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.100]   that your posture towards your wife and your kids.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.420]   Hey, I got some verses for that.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.140]   And the more and more they just remind me of God's word
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.420]   and it gets in my mind and it gets in my heart
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.000]   and then it just begins to ooze out of you.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.060]   But some of us tonight, man,
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.360]   we're not hiding the word of God in our heart.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.280]   We're saying I'm too busy.
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:37.300]   But look at the time you spend on your phone.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.140]   You know, those smartphones can track it now.
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.420]   And I'm not here to shame you, man.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.740]   I had to do the same thing 'cause I was making excuses
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.440]   for not spending time with the Lord, for not praying.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:53.140]   If you're too busy to be a Christian, man, you're too busy.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.660]   God's calling some of you to step up,
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.420]   to draw a line in the sand, nail stake in the ground.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.940]   Tonight's the night you find community.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.500]   Tonight's the night you become fully known.
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.900]   I like what Tim Keller says.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.140]   He says, "To be loved but not known
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.820]   is comforting but superficial."
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:21.820]   To be known and not loved is our greatest fear.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.700]   But to be fully loved, excuse me,
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.600]   but to be fully known and truly loved,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.240]   well, it's a lot like being loved by God.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.360]   The men in my life are some of the greatest expressions
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.680]   of God's love for me in a real tangible way.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.360]   Those four men that I meet with, I see Christ in them.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.440]   It's like, "Where's Christ, man?
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   Why can't I see God?"
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   You got community?
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.540]   You got people in your life that are in the trenches
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.400]   with you, that are responding to you
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.160]   in a way that's gonna point you to Christ
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.480]   and not make excuses for your sin,
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.320]   but they tell you the hard things.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.220]   And they say, "Come on, let's go.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.120]   I got you."
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.960]   (smacks lips)
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.400]   Proverbs 28, 13 says,
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.280]   "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.700]   but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:24.020]   You know, the secret to life
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.480]   is to live a life without secrets.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.540]   Why?
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.840]   Because it brings healing and mercy.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.300]   Do you want healing tonight?
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.600]   Do you want mercy tonight?
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.880]   You might be asking, "Joseph, how does this look like?"
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.200]   Well, I tried to share with you.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.160]   Let me just kind of go one step deeper.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.000]   I'm not saying you gotta go before 10 people
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.880]   and confess your sin.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.560]   I'm like, "Hey, do you know someone
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.400]   who's a, if you're a lady in the room,
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   she's a strong woman of God,
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.080]   that you can pick up the phone and you can call.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.960]   If you're a guy, you know a strong man of God,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.520]   just one person that you can just begin to walk this out
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.500]   and flesh this out.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.320]   And you might not be able to give all the details.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.640]   Like you gotta start somewhere, right?
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.600]   You gotta build trust somewhere,
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   but you gotta go first in this.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.360]   If you're waiting for community to find you,
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.840]   it's not gonna find you, you gotta find it.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.080]   You gotta pursue it.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.940]   And you just pick up the phone and you just say,
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.640]   "Hey, I've been looking at that two-dimensional image.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.200]   I can't give you all the details, but there I said it.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.760]   Hey, listen, I've been overeating and under eating
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.080]   because life, my life just feels out of control.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.720]   It's the one thing I can control.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.240]   Hey, I've been managing information.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.440]   Haven't been being honest with you.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   I've lied to your face plenty of times there I said it.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.840]   Hey, I was literally heading to the strip club tonight."
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.660]   I mean, maybe this is one of your stories.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.440]   Maybe you go there weekly
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.820]   because your greatest desire is to be wanted.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.140]   Your greatest desire is to be pursued,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.280]   but you took that detour and you came to the porch tonight.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.780]   You just need to confess that.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.920]   I don't know what your thing is,
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.200]   but you just need to go first and you need to say,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.880]   "Hey, I need help.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.520]   I need to get this off my chest.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.960]   I need to start doing life with people
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.200]   that are gonna love me for who I am,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.240]   but are gonna love me enough
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.760]   to not allow me to stay in that thing."
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:23.740]   God calls us to confess our sin,
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.080]   to carry each other's burdens, to pray for each other.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.320]   We have trusted friends that come alongside of you
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.120]   and help you fight against your sin.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.920]   Proverbs 18, one says,
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.600]   "Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire."
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.280]   In other words, it's the opposite
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.120]   of what we're talking about.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.520]   You just kind of do your own thing, you go your own way.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.520]   And it's like, you just want your desires.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.780]   Okay, you just told us you just want your desires.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.120]   But then look at the next part.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.280]   He breaks out against all sound judgment.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.760]   You don't even have wisdom now.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.880]   I can't tell you how many times I've showed up
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.880]   on a Friday morning at 6 a.m.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:36:00.360]   And I've just said, "Hey, I don't know what to do with X."
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.080]   Whether it's a sin struggle or a big decision
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.320]   or financial insecurities.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.440]   And I just said, "Guys, I need help."
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.920]   And they begin to walk with me
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.420]   and point me to the truth of God's word.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.580]   Like some of you tonight, man,
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.200]   God is also saying like,
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.520]   "Hey, it's not good to be alone in the crowd."
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.360]   Like you might think, "I'm not alone,"
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.080]   because you have something to belong to.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.200]   But belonging has to do with becoming fully known.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.680]   Like you might think, "Hey, you're belonging
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.140]   because you do that CrossFit thing
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.600]   or SoulCycle or barre classes."
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.120]   Like my wife, man, she loves that barre stuff.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.560]   I don't even get it, man.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.280]   It's like a whole nother world.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.400]   I'm like, "Body weight?
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.440]   Nah, I'm out."
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.000]   You know, and then she shows me some exercise
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.560]   and your boy can't even do them, right?
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.620]   But that's neither here nor there.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.720]   But people just think they're belonging to something
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.360]   because they're a part of just that activity
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.800]   or it's the happy hour thing.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.560]   But people don't know the real you.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.920]   And here's why it's not good.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.600]   Because you and I will never be fully loved
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.160]   until we're fully known.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.760]   It's what Tim Kelly was saying.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:19.740]   And it's liberating, man, to be fully known,
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.720]   but then also to be fully loved.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.200]   Some of us, man, we've gotten so comfortable
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.480]   in just showing this false view of ourself.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.600]   Like we just, we're hanging out with these people
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.580]   and they don't know you.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.000]   And so it's just the false version of you.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.880]   And it's not good.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.400]   It's not how you were created.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.700]   It's not how, it's not what you were made for.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.480]   And I'm just thinking like,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:52.440]   what would it look like tonight if we took this serious?
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.120]   What would it look like in 2023 if we took this serious?
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.840]   Like if we created a place where we could truly
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.000]   be fully loved as we were being fully known
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.300]   no matter where we'd been.
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.880]   I don't get scared, man.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.560]   The world doesn't operate like this.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.400]   The world has performance-based acceptance.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.520]   You do this and then I'll accept you.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.480]   And the gospel is the way different.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.400]   It's acceptance-based performance.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.440]   God's accepted you right where you are.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.900]   We've accepted you right where you are.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.040]   Not so that you go perform,
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.200]   but so that you would experience the love
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.240]   and the intimacy of Christ and his church and his people.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.600]   I want that for you tonight.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.160]   God wants that for you tonight.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.400]   This is my story, man.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.260]   Jesus got ahold of me as I was wrapping up college
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.180]   and my life came to a screeching halt, man.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.200]   Everything I'd worked so hard for was falling,
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.540]   you know, starting to fall into place.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:52.840]   I was playing college baseball
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.040]   and, you know, just thinking I had life by the coattails.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.960]   And I remember finishing up a game
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.160]   and going back to my apartment that night
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.020]   and I just asked the question, is that it?
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.240]   'Cause if these things aren't gonna do it anymore,
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.080]   what's gonna do it?
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.580]   And sin was just ruling my life.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.600]   And I finally saw my sin for what it was
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.620]   in light of a holy God.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.180]   I always say, hey, you'll never appreciate
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.600]   the cross of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.000]   You'll never sing loud.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.160]   You'll never get on mission.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.560]   You'll never open up this Bible
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.920]   if you don't really see your need
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.120]   for what he's done for you.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:24.340]   And I finally had lived enough life
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.500]   to know that life is broken apart from him.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:32.240]   And the God of the Bible stepped out of heaven
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.900]   and said, I'm gonna stoop down and become a servant.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.320]   You tell me another religion out there that does that.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.360]   There isn't one, man.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.560]   That's what separates Christianity from all other religions.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.060]   And so God met me all in my mess,
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.920]   a 10-year battle of porn,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.360]   taking advantage of one woman after another
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.520]   and the life of the party and alcohol and drugs
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.800]   and you name it.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.760]   And he just said, Josiah, I want you.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.200]   I want you to experience life, man.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.680]   These manic highs and these manic lows that you have,
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.080]   man, none of that anymore.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   I got you, man.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.680]   I've given you a roadmap.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.940]   Follow me, trust me.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.300]   It's not gonna be easy, but I got you, man.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:20.320]   You can be forgiven, set free, healed, and walk
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.160]   in all that you were made to walk in.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.920]   And you'll be purposed.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.120]   You'll have purpose.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.920]   Purpose will mark your life.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.080]   Not just this silly game that's gonna end someday.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.460]   Not just making a million dollars by the time you're 30.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:36.880]   I didn't do that, by the way.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.000]   But you know what I'm saying?
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.600]   I went into ministry, help me.
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.820]   But God has given me this purpose, man,
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.260]   that is way bigger,
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.840]   that's gonna outlast anything in this world.
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.320]   And I love my people that are in the business world,
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.280]   and you're hustling, that's awesome, man, do it.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.340]   But for whose glory?
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.180]   For your own?
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.600]   Man, that's a dead-end road, bro.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.240]   It ain't gonna last.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   And so God began to show me that He was calling me
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.900]   from that life, He was calling me to Himself,
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:09.960]   and I began to learn that, hey,
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.320]   God never calls you from something
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.480]   without calling you to something.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.400]   And what He called me to
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.680]   was to change my playground and my playmates.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.040]   He called me out of those playgrounds
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.720]   and those playmates, and not just to ostracize them.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.920]   A lot of them were my closest boys, man, I love them.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.760]   But I just said, hey, guys,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.600]   I can't just be going back to those old stopping grounds,
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.400]   man, we can still hang,
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.480]   but I'm gonna be telling you about Jesus,
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.600]   you can tell me about what you do,
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.000]   but I'm gonna be telling you about Jesus,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.360]   so if you can accept me for who I am, let's go.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.160]   And God just began to change my life,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.800]   and the people that I spent my quality time with,
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.060]   the majority of my time with were like-minded people.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.320]   Do you have that tonight?
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.860]   Last and final truth,
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:56.200]   God's calling you to commit, called to commit.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.440]   Tonight's the night.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.200]   People come up to me all the time and say,
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   man, I feel like your story is my story.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.600]   What'd you do?
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.520]   I said, apart from the grace of God,
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:16.040]   I went all in with men that said they wanted to be about it.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.520]   I'm not talking about people
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.280]   that just wanna check the Tuesday night box,
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.920]   or the Sunday morning box.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.380]   I'm talking about people that were real.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.480]   They struggled with sin, but they struggled well.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.400]   They didn't just sit back and make life about them,
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.120]   they served.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.800]   I was 31 when I got married.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.520]   Do you think I forgot what it's like to be single?
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.640]   Year after year, eight Valentine's days passed by,
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.040]   and your boy was single.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.800]   Tears and laying in bed at night,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.440]   thinking God, what, is this is how it's gonna be?
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.000]   I can go get a woman.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.680]   He's like, that's not the kind of women you want, Josiah.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.160]   Okay, okay, all right.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.360]   Center me, center me.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.660]   Bring me back to reality.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.520]   And God just started showing me, man,
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.180]   that this is where life is found.
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:19.180]   That following Him is adventurous, man.
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:23.540]   If you got some crazy idea
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.860]   of what it looks like to follow Christ,
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.140]   and you just sing songs and listen to messages,
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.220]   and you never do anything with it, man, you're crazy, man.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.540]   Just go back to the Porch Podcast archive
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.220]   and listen to the messages.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:39.220]   This life is way different than my BC days before Christ.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.860]   More joy.
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.140]   So I locked it in with men that wanted to go all in,
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.860]   and they walked with me through the highest of highs,
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.420]   the lowest of lows.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.980]   The destructive divorce that plagued me
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.400]   and had anger and bitterness in my heart for years,
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.600]   they began to unpack that layer by layer by layer.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.900]   The stage four cancer that my sister-in-law went through,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.220]   they began to walk with me through that.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.860]   Like, what is the world's solution to those problems,
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.700]   to those pains?
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:17.860]   Ah, let's go get a six pack or a 12, let's go to the bar,
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:19.620]   let's go numb ourself, come on.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.120]   You know there ain't no life there,
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.140]   and you keep lying to yourself week in and week out.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:33.660]   And they began to give me real solutions
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.540]   for real problems that I was going through.
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.980]   When I lost one of my best friends
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.340]   in a tragic plane accident,
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.940]   they showed up.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.380]   When I finally got married, come on somebody,
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.300]   they celebrated me.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.540]   When I had my first child, they were there.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.660]   They showed up for me, man, in the highest of highs
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.040]   and the lowest of lows.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.460]   Call to commit.
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.060]   Tonight's the night that many of you,
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   you pass from this world of superficial,
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:15.180]   lacking depth of relationship,
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:20.740]   to truly going all in, not just with Christ,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.800]   but with his people.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.180]   And I always wonder, man, what my life would look like
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.140]   if I never went all in with his people.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:33.980]   I always wonder, I'm like, man, what would my life look like?
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.640]   Like, would I still be living in my parents' house,
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.440]   playing video games at an unhealthy level?
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.260]   Like just maybe at a tailgate,
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.820]   Dallas Cowboys in the parking lot,
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.020]   talking about how I never made it drunk.
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:54.040]   Just addicted to pornography,
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.940]   addicted to myself, just a poser,
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:03.500]   like just telling people one thing and doing another.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.600]   I always wonder, what would your life look like?
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.040]   What would your life look like if you never stepped out
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.760]   in what we talked about tonight?
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.560]   Like there's a countdown right here.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:23.440]   That's a long time, it feels like, but that's just a year.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:29.720]   Like if Jesus showed up a year from tonight
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.320]   or three weeks ago, four weeks ago,
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.760]   when we launched the porch, is he gonna be cool
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.260]   with just like, oh, just me and Jesus, just me and you?
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.860]   Or is he gonna be like, man, what?
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.360]   I've given you a church, man, I've given you people.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:46.540]   What are you gonna do with it?
[00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.700]   You're gonna go all in?
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:53.560]   A call to community, a call to be fully known.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:47:00.400]   And lastly, a call to commit.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.680]   Let me pray that you would tonight.
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:08.380]   God in heaven, go before my friends.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.900]   There's nothing I say or said
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.420]   that can change the trajectory of their heart
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   and the trajectory of their life.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:23.940]   Would you help the unbelief that plagues this room?
[00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.780]   And would you turn that into belief?
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:33.180]   Would you help the fears and the insecurities
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.660]   that we have to step into a community
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.120]   that we talked about tonight?
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.260]   And would they just go all in?
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:47.740]   And would they experience the richness of your blessings
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.460]   through the tangible expressions of grace and mercy
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:56.100]   and peace and love and wisdom and discernment
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.720]   that your people are marked by?
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.580]   And no matter what kind of experience they've had
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.980]   growing up in the church
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.140]   or even in their young adult years, God,
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.220]   would they continue to pursue it?
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.140]   And would they continue to pursue you?
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:18.300]   And God, would you meet them where they are
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.580]   for your glory, our joy, and the world's good.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.380]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
