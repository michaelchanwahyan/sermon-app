[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   1, 2, 3, 4.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:28.040]   Forge, what's up?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.320]   How we doing?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.240]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.120]   Man, so good to see you.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.960]   How are you tonight?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.460]   Good?
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280]   Doing OK?
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.200]   Hey, special shout out to some of our friends
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.280]   tuning in from across the nation.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   Porch Live Midland.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.640]   Yeah, Porch Live Dayton and Porch Live Des Moines.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.140]   Really glad you guys are joining us.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.760]   Thanks so much for tuning in and being
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.100]   a part of what God is doing, not only here in our city,
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.280]   but in your city too.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.000]   God can genuinely meet with anyone, anywhere,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.160]   and at any time.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.860]   And so we're really glad that you would
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.800]   trust us with your Tuesday.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.440]   Well, just a few years ago, Brooke and I
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.120]   were traveling to Colorado for a wedding in a remote city
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.720]   called Lake City.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.360]   We'd never been there before, but we
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.000]   knew by the time we landed in Denver,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.680]   it was approximately a four-hour drive from the airport
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.760]   to the destination.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.640]   And so we land in Denver.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.520]   We make our way over to the rental car agency.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.320]   We get into our rental car.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.160]   And right as I'm pulling out of the parking lot,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.560]   I stop the car, and I look over to my wife,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.640]   and I say, hey, we should just pray.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   You know, we got four hours in the car together.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.360]   We should pray that over the course of the next four hours,
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.280]   God would meet with us.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.560]   And so I prayed this specifically.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.160]   I said, God, as we drive today, would you make yourself
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.440]   known to us along the way?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.920]   And then I proceeded to hit the gas,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.960]   pull out of the parking lot, and we
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.560]   traversed our way to our destination in Lake City.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.240]   One hour passed by.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.760]   Two hours passed by.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.320]   Three hours passed by.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.280]   And then four hours passed by.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.160]   And as I looked around, I could tell, man,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.320]   it doesn't really feel like we're
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.240]   getting close to Lake City.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.000]   I've never been there before.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.360]   I don't know what it looks like.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600]   But it doesn't seem like we're actually
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.000]   getting as close as we should be by this point.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.480]   Brooke, where are we at right now?
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.400]   And she proceeds to look at the GPS,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.880]   and she realizes that we are up.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.280]   We're still three hours away from our destination, which
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.880]   was horrifying to learn in the moment,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.560]   because by the time we had learned this news,
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.760]   we could have already been there.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.720]   We could have already shown up and said hello
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.800]   to the bridal party and gotten into our room
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   and checked in nice and cozy.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   But instead, we still had three hours in the car.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.080]   I love my wife.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.740]   But that's seven hours of total driving,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.160]   and that's a long time behind the wheel.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.200]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.440]   So we look around, and I'm traumatized by the fact
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.360]   that we still have this long to go.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.440]   And so I start to wonder to myself, what happened?
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   And then I realize it was Apple Maps.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.200]   It led us astray.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.840]   It took us down the longest foreseeable route possible
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.480]   from Denver to our destination.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.600]   We had made a grievous mistake.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.160]   We did not choose the quickest route.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.320]   Instead, we chose a long route unbeknownst to us.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.880]   And so in this moment, I'm frustrated,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.280]   frustrated with the situation, frustrated with my wife.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.960]   I'm frustrated with the fact that Colorado
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.040]   even has a route that's this long to get to this city
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.480]   when it's not necessary.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.440]   I am so frustrated that our GPS has taken us down a road,
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.340]   the likes of which we never had to go.
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.040]   And yet, it was a road the likes of which God
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   very clearly wanted us to drive down.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   Because as we made our way to Lake City,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.640]   down the scenic route, what we found is
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   we were trapped in a field of wildflowers in bloom,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:02.520]   crystal lakes cascading through thousands of acres
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.320]   all at sunset.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.800]   Because this route that we did not choose for ourself,
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.320]   but God chose for us, actually took us
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.920]   into the Rio Grande National Forest.
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.460]   And it was there that God decided to answer my prayer.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.220]   He was making himself known to us along the way.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.800]   Now, why do I tell you that?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.000]   Because over the course of the last several weeks,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.480]   we here at The Porch have been working through a series
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.760]   called Essential that has felt a lot like this journey
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.200]   of mine in Colorado.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.220]   We've been talking about the one thing
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.040]   that brings everything into focus.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.960]   That's been our destination to talk about the one thing.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.760]   And yet, it has taken us now five total weeks of time
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.040]   to unpack one thing,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.400]   which feels a little bit like a bait and switch.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.320]   You're like, wait, I showed up for one thing
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.600]   and I've gotten over a month's worth of teaching.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.560]   Like, what is with this?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.200]   This shouldn't be so difficult.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.720]   Like, this is the most important thing
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.960]   and yet it's taking so long for you to explain to us.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.760]   I feel like I've shown up week after week after week
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.120]   and I feel like I'm learning the same thing
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.960]   over and over and over.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.640]   Why is it taking so long?
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.800]   And the reason is because that which is most important,
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   according to the scriptures,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.880]   the one thing that God wants you to know,
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.560]   which is that we should aspire
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.600]   to see as much of him as possible.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.520]   We don't arrive at that quickly,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.520]   but instead, that's a process that takes a long time
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.740]   and often leads us down a road much further
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.180]   than we initially intended or expected.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.640]   This is why we've been journeying through the series.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.540]   We have been looking at these one thing statements.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.280]   One thing I ask, one thing I lack, one thing I do,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.620]   one thing I need, one thing I know,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.960]   because those statements reinforce the importance
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.600]   of seeing God for who he is.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.400]   That's the most important thing in the Bible,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.440]   to get your eyes on him, to set your gaze on him,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.160]   to see him and as much of him as possible,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.080]   which takes time.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.520]   And tonight, we're arriving at the end of our destination
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.420]   because tonight we find ourselves
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.720]   on the fifth one thing statement,
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.240]   which is in John chapter nine.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.440]   So if you have a Bible, you can grab your Bible,
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.160]   you can turn with me to John chapter nine.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.600]   While you're doing that, what you need to know is this,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.120]   as we turn to this story,
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.760]   we're gonna catch up to Jesus in Jerusalem.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.520]   It's in chapter seven that he travels to Jerusalem
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.280]   for the Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.160]   What you need to know about the Feast of Tabernacles
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.800]   is it was one of three annual feasts,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.640]   the people of Jerusalem, the people of Israel,
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.200]   they would celebrate every single year
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.640]   that was a pilgrimage feast.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.900]   So that meant that they would celebrate this feast
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.680]   by way of traveling back to the holy city,
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.320]   that native Jews spread all over the globe.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.480]   They would return to Jerusalem in this moment,
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.620]   which meant that the city
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.520]   was busting at the seams of people.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.920]   Like there are thousands upon thousands
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.000]   upon thousands of people, travelers,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.800]   that are native Jews that have returned to the city
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.720]   for the Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.240]   And this feast, it's like a giant party.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.760]   Like everyone has high spirits
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   because they've shown back up to celebrate God's provision
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.880]   of the nation of Israel over the course
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.600]   of the last several centuries.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   That's what's happening in this story.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.440]   We catch up to Jesus in a moment
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.720]   where he's surrounded by thousands.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.840]   People are setting up booths,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.520]   they're in temporary shelters,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.080]   the streets are littered with folks.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.360]   And in the scene, we see in verse one,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.200]   that as he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.640]   And his disciples asked him,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.580]   "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents?"
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.320]   That he was born blind.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.640]   And Jesus answered,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.840]   "It was not that this man sinned or his parents,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.700]   but that the works of God might be displayed in him.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.440]   We must work the works of him who sent me while it's day.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.480]   Night is coming when no one can work.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.200]   As long as I'm in the world, I'm the light of the world."
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.840]   So just briefly,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.120]   we're gonna work all the way through this passage,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.160]   but I do wanna just stop here for a minute
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.800]   because we need to see what's happening.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.580]   The disciples, they see this man,
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.560]   this man born blind, sitting on the side of the road
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.340]   and they ask Jesus an odd line of questioning.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.820]   Like, "Hey, this guy is pretty messed up.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.460]   He's in a weird situation.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.440]   Whose fault is it?
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.400]   Is it his fault that he sinned against his parents
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.020]   or is it his parents' fault?"
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.380]   Which feels strange to us.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.200]   And yet, what we just need to know
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.060]   is it actually accords with Jewish tradition.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.580]   You see, according to Jewish tradition,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.940]   what we know is that at the time of conception,
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.060]   it was believed that a fetus could choose
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.620]   between two different inclinations.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.020]   One good and one evil.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.980]   If it chose an evil inclination, then it would do things.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.940]   It would kick in the womb
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.140]   and it would make the pregnancy really hard
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.260]   and there'd be lots of morning sickness.
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.460]   And the belief would be that that fetus
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.480]   has chosen an evil inclination
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.980]   and thus it stands likely to suffer some sort of defect
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.780]   as it comes into the world.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.740]   This was one belief.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.380]   The alternative is that God was revisiting
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.300]   the errors or mistakes of the parents upon that child.
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.380]   That, "Hey, you guys, y'all messed up in the past."
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.220]   And so what I'm gonna do
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.100]   is I'm gonna get my paddle flushed from the little guy.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.980]   That was kind of God's perspective
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.220]   according to Jewish tradition.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.140]   And yet, Jesus, he knows that this is what they're thinking
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.300]   and he's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.900]   That's not what happened here."
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.900]   He says, "No, it's not the man, nor is it the parents' fault.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.500]   They're not the cause of his condition.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.820]   His flaws, they don't exist to perpetuate his shame.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.200]   His flaws exist to promote God's glory."
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.340]   That's what he says.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.940]   That his pain, it's not pointless.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.180]   It's purposeful.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.620]   God wants to use him to make himself known,
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.820]   which I think is important for us to just take time
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.860]   and unpack really quickly here
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.060]   because some of you have walked in here tonight
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.380]   and you have some imperfections, some blemishes,
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.560]   some deficiencies that you think,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.060]   "Man, God, you just don't love me.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.980]   Like this has happened to me,
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.420]   I guess because of something I did in the past."
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.180]   And yet what you need to know by way of this quick text
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.740]   is that your imperfections,
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.720]   that thing which you feel is so messed up in your life,
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.820]   it's not the result of some divine displeasure
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.780]   God has with you, that that's not the case.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.020]   No, instead what this text is telling us
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.860]   is that there's no karma in the Christian life.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.300]   Like there's no, what you give is what you get.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.460]   You reap what you sow.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.460]   What goes around comes around.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.700]   Like that's not a philosophy in the Christian worldview.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.140]   No, the Christian worldview is not
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.700]   that we get what we deserve,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.860]   it's that we get what we do not deserve.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.900]   We get what Christ deserves.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.580]   What does Christ deserve?
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.020]   The love of God.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   A love that's not transactional, that's not quid pro quo.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.140]   Hey, you give me a little bit of that,
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.060]   I'll give you a little bit of this.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.940]   That's not the kind of love that God has for his people.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.540]   It's not the kind of love that he has for his son.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.980]   He has an unconditional love, which is ours in Christ.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.220]   We get grace, unmerited favor.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.820]   And Jesus is using this man's story tonight
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.420]   to help us realize that his blemishes,
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.900]   they're but a canvas upon which God is going to paint
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.460]   a beautiful portrait for us to see,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.760]   which is why he does what he does next.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.260]   Verse six, "Having said these things,
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.260]   Jesus spit on the ground and he made mud with the saliva.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.820]   Then he anointed the man's eyes with the mud
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.720]   and he said to him, 'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,'"
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.620]   which means sent.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.680]   So he went, he washed, and he came back to sin.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.980]   Now, Jesus's treatment of this man
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.460]   is very different than the disciples'
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.420]   and it's very different than anyone's treatment
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   of this man, right?
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.880]   None of us would treat this man this way
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.220]   because it's not common to just smear mud
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.100]   into people's faces.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.220]   This is something that's very unique to Jesus
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.620]   and yet it's very purposeful to Jesus.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.480]   You see, the disciples, they engage this man's condition
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.460]   as fodder for theological discussion.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.380]   Man, that guy looks like he did something wrong,
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.320]   so what do you think caused it?
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.000]   That's not what Jesus does.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.060]   He doesn't see his condition as just fodder
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.500]   or fuel for theological discussion.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.260]   He sees it as an opportunity for new revelation.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.580]   He sees it as a chance to present both to this man
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.380]   and to the rest of the crowd,
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.340]   the watching world in that moment, who God is.
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.380]   What we said at the beginning,
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.020]   the most important thing is to see
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.140]   as much of God as possible.
[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.220]   Jesus is looking at this man,
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.620]   he's saying, "This is perfect.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.220]   "I can help them see God through this guy's example."
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.020]   And so Jesus takes us to our first point.
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.740]   He proves to us through this man
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.260]   that he will meet us where we are
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.700]   so we can see him as he is.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.420]   Jesus meets us where we are so we can see him as he is.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.060]   That's why he spits on the ground,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.340]   he makes some mud, and he smears it on the guy's eyes.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.100]   Like this isn't a long lost treatment
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.540]   for blindness, this is something that Jesus
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.820]   is very uniquely and specifically doing for this guy.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.980]   There's an important detail in this story.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.900]   This man was born blind, okay?
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.340]   The author, John, really wants us to get it.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.180]   He wants us to know, "Hey, this guy was born blind."
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.100]   It says that he was blind 13 times
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.740]   over the course of this entire chapter,
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.860]   and it details that he was blind from birth
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.260]   over five times in this chapter
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.940]   because he needs us to know.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.860]   Jesus isn't just curing a very general kind of blindness,
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.740]   he's curing a very specific kind of blindness.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.060]   It was a blindness that was from birth,
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.400]   meaning that this man's issue is that he was created wrong.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.980]   Like his problem isn't that he lost vision,
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.300]   it's that he never had vision.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.140]   The issue is that he was created blind.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.760]   So catch this, what does Jesus do?
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.880]   He stoops down and he meets the man where he is.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.640]   He takes from the dust of the ground.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.760]   He forms new life upon which he smears to this man's eyes,
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.320]   and instead of just giving restoration to his sight,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.160]   he brings a recreation to his sight.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   Jesus becomes the God of creation, do you see it?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.800]   Like that's what he's doing in this moment.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.400]   And what's amazing about this is as Jesus goes along,
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.760]   he doesn't just meet this guy where he is,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.240]   he meets this guy where everyone is
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.640]   because he performs a miracle,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.960]   the likes of which would have put everybody on notice
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.880]   because he performs what we know as a messianic miracle.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.360]   The Old Testament talks about three specific miracles
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.400]   that only the Messiah would have been able to perform.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.580]   Those three miracles, number one is cleansing a leper,
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.120]   because to cleanse a leper,
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.320]   you would have made yourself unclean,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.420]   which the Messiah couldn't be.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.280]   The Messiah had to be clean.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.840]   Number two was casting out a mute demon.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.920]   You see, the proper Jewish methodology for exorcism
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.720]   required that you cast a demon out by its name.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   That's how you had authority over it.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.240]   And yet if the demon was mute, if it couldn't speak,
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.560]   then you couldn't know its name
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.240]   and you had no authority to cast it out.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.080]   Yet the Messiah would be able to do that anyways.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.760]   And then the third messianic miracle
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.080]   is that you would be able to heal a man born blind,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.920]   because this isn't just an act of restoration,
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.980]   it's an act of recreation.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.300]   It's restoring something, recreating something
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.220]   that was never there to begin with.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.860]   You see, by the time we reach this story,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.900]   and Jesus has already performed two of those miracles.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.380]   He's done the first two.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.100]   And as he comes to this moment with this man,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.160]   he performs the third, which puts everybody on red alert.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.480]   Like it freaks everybody, the ever-loving out.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.940]   They see that he doesn't just heal this blind man.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.080]   Blind people were getting healed by Pharisees, right?
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.940]   Like this was something that rabbis could do
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.660]   at some level of infrequency.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.980]   No, Jesus does something that has never been done
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.340]   in the history of humanity.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:06.020]   And in so doing, he proves I'm the Messiah.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.360]   It's kind of like the process you go
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.900]   to get verified on Instagram, right?
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.060]   That's what Jesus is doing.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.500]   He's trying to earn, not pay for,
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.540]   earn that little blue check mark.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.940]   He wants everyone to know I'm the real deal.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.660]   Like I'm the genuine article.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.620]   And so what does he do?
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.660]   He does exactly what you would do on Instagram.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.420]   Like he presents that he's authentic.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.020]   He represents, like what does it mean?
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.980]   You have to represent a real and genuine person.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.500]   Jesus is that.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.380]   Like we can historically verify the fact
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.300]   that Jesus is authentically real.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.140]   There has to be a level of uniqueness
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.720]   to the person's account.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.580]   You have to represent the unique presence of that person.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.560]   One account is allowed per person,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.060]   just meaning you've actually gotta be you.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.740]   Jesus is not trying to be anybody that he's not.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.460]   He's very content in his identity.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.860]   Very secure individual.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.500]   So he's uniquely himself and no one else.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.360]   He also, he presents a complete account.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.580]   Like he demonstrates to everyone that yes, he is public.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.420]   He does have a bio.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.860]   Hello, I'm the son of God.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.980]   He has a profile photo.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.460]   You can catch me on the Galilean seaside.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.300]   And I'm active.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.140]   I'm out here, I'm doing things.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.560]   I'm teaching, I'm performing miracles.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.980]   Jesus is very completely himself.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.080]   And then lastly, he's notable.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.620]   Like he is noteworthy.
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.420]   People want to know him.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.580]   He is a well-known figure.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.620]   He has a brand and a persona,
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.960]   the likes of which sends people flocking.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.940]   You know, like they want to get
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.260]   as close to this guy as they can.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.640]   They are fascinated by the authority with which he teaches.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.300]   Jesus is verifying for everyone,
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:39.700]   hey, I am the Messiah and to leave no room for doubt,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.020]   I'm going to perform these miracles
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.340]   so that way you know I am he and no one else is.
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.980]   Because this is a title, again, you don't buy, but you earn.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.380]   It's something that has to be proven.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.420]   And Jesus is doing that in this moment.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   He's showing that I'm the literal king.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.840]   Like I'm the anointed one.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.220]   I'm the deliverer, savior of God's chosen people, Israel.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.060]   That's who I am.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.520]   That's what he's proving to everybody
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.060]   by way of this moment.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.560]   He's the one that people have been waiting for.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.920]   That stories have been told about.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.620]   That prayers have been lifted to, that hope hinges upon.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.620]   That's who Jesus Christ is.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.860]   And in so doing this miracle,
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.620]   yes, he's meeting this man where he's at,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.740]   but he's meeting everyone where they're at too.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.060]   Catch this, this is amazing.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.020]   Jesus, he meets this blind man where he is.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.660]   What's this man need?
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.300]   He needs recreation.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.180]   He can't see.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.580]   He's never been able to see.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.280]   So what does Jesus do?
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.400]   He stoops to his level and he performs the miracle
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.260]   in a way that demonstrates he is the creator God.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.400]   What about the crowds?
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400]   What do they need?
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.480]   He meets them where they are.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.560]   He performs a miracle,
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.480]   the likes of which they all had been anticipating.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.440]   They had all been waiting for.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.480]   He performs a miracle that demonstrates
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.280]   he is not just a teacher, a prophet, a nice guy,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.600]   a moral example to follow, a revolutionary leader.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.400]   No, he is the Messiah.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.180]   And not only that, the Pharisees in the story.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.340]   What does Jesus do?
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.840]   He performs a miracle on Sabbath.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.380]   And not just any Sabbath, a high Sabbath, a festival Sabbath,
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.540]   a really important day.
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.500]   He performs it on a day that was intended for rest
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.860]   and that sends the Pharisees up in arms
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.260]   because he wants to prove to them,
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.780]   I am the Lord of the Sabbath.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.620]   Do you see it?
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   In this one moment, he meets everyone right where they are
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:53.240]   so they can see him exactly as he is,
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.960]   which is why God brought some of you here tonight.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.840]   Like you've not walked into this room
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.800]   and fooled God into seeing you
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.600]   as something other than you're not.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.360]   Like you've not come in here and cleaned yourself up enough
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.280]   that God's like, yeah, man, you're looking good.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.120]   You know, like, no, you walked in here tonight
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   and he knows you exactly as you are in your inmost self.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.260]   Not like this guy, not blind and begging,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.460]   but burdened all the same.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.240]   And what he wants to do for you
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.320]   is exactly what he does for this man.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.440]   He wants to meet you where you are
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:37.180]   that you might see him as he is.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.320]   So for some of you, he knows you are overwhelmed
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.440]   by the approval of others.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.120]   Like you just want people to like you.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:45.960]   Like you'll do anything.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.200]   I'll compromise my character.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.160]   Like what do I gotta do?
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.000]   What do I gotta sell?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.840]   Where do I gotta be?
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.660]   What do I need to say?
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.500]   You'll do anything
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.120]   'cause you just want people to approve of you.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.840]   And Jesus is like, calm down.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:00.460]   I'm a friend that's as close as a brother.
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.800]   That's what Galatians 3:29 tells us.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.780]   Some of you, you are trapped in addiction.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.220]   You are enslaved to your sin.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.820]   You have cravings, hungers, appetites, desires,
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.380]   the likes of which you have prayed would go away,
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.740]   and yet they are still there waiting for you
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.380]   early in the morning and late into the evening.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.940]   You are trapped in an addiction.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.940]   And Jesus is saying, hey, I'm a wonderful counselor.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.020]   I can help you through that.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.820]   Colossians, or Isaiah 9, 6.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.500]   Some of you, you're desperate for things to get better.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.620]   In your job, in your relationship with your family,
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.940]   amongst your parents, in your friendships, whatever it is,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.500]   you're just desperate for things to get better.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   God, it seems like nothing will ever actually improve.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.620]   And yet he's looking and he's saying,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.460]   hey, you're not hopeless.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.540]   You have me.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.700]   I'm the hope of glory, Colossians 1, 27.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.620]   Some of you, you're haunted by past mistakes.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.700]   You think back to that thing you did,
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.140]   not just yesterday, not just last week,
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.620]   not just last month, but years ago.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.260]   And you're still carrying it with you.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.780]   You're haunted by something that happened so long ago,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.900]   and yet he's looking at you and he's saying,
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.580]   no, no, no, there's no sin, which I will not forgive.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.740]   Luke 23, 24.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.660]   Some of you, you're not just thinking about the past,
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.060]   you're afraid of the future.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.300]   It freaks you out.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.860]   You don't know what's gonna happen out there.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   And so what you do is you just sit and dwell
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.020]   and worry and complain right here.
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.860]   And yet your fear of the future is something
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.500]   Jesus looks at and he says, no, no, no,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.900]   you don't need to worry about what's ahead.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.020]   I will take care of it.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.140]   I am the way.
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.140]   I am the truth.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.540]   I am the life.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.700]   John 14, 26.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.140]   Some of you, you are enslaved to secrets
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.240]   you feel you can never share.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.060]   There is some hidden sin,
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.800]   some forbidden shame,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.940]   that God, if it ever got out into the light of day,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.380]   you'd lose your job, you'd lose your relationship,
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.500]   your family would disown you,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.780]   your community would outright expose you.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.460]   You can't, you can't get it out in the open.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.060]   No one can ever know I'm going to the grave with this thing.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.100]   I'll never share this secret I have.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.620]   And yet Jesus is looking at you and he's saying, no,
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.180]   I am a savior that has come to rescue you from that.
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.380]   Luke 19, 10.
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.480]   Some of you tonight,
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.060]   you've been walking with God for a long time.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.360]   You're comfortable in spaces like this.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.820]   You know all the lyrics of the songs we sing.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.100]   You raise your hands in the right moments.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.980]   And yet you're spiritually flatlining.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.780]   And your doubtful things will ever return
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.960]   to the way they were at first.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.760]   Jesus welcomes all who are weary and heavy laden.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.660]   That's what Matthew 11 says.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.700]   And to the last of you,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   your sin's not hidden in secret.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.640]   It has been laid bare for all to see.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.160]   You walk into rooms like this
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.120]   and just by way of your presence entering the doorway,
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.280]   you feel exposed and vulnerable
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.000]   amongst a people like the porch.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.020]   Jesus looks at you and he says,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.680]   I'm a man you are.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.680]   I'm with you.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.060]   You're not alone.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.100]   You're welcome here.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:46.540]   Jesus knows your condition and he's come close anyways.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.680]   He wants to meet you where you are
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.380]   that you might see him as he is.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.620]   That's what he does for this man.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.820]   And that's what he wants to do for you.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.940]   But there's a catch.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.940]   Jesus will complicate your life to clarify your vision.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.760]   He will complicate your life to clarify your vision.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.940]   I hate to be the bearer of bad news.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.180]   Listen, that's a tough bit to sell.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.300]   I'll admit it, but it's true.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.700]   I've got to give it to you straight.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.140]   This is what we learn in this story.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.900]   Like Jesus, he not only wants you to see him,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.460]   he wants you to see him clearly,
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.300]   like he wants it to be 20/20 vision.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.180]   He wants you to get all of him and more.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.340]   He wants you to have the full array
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.300]   of who he is as a person,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.660]   which means he will complicate your life
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.020]   to clarify your vision.
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.960]   Why do parents give their children chores?
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.060]   Why do they unnecessarily complicate their lives?
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:48.340]   Because without them, they're spoiled and entitled
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.180]   and self-interested and a pain upon this world.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.380]   No, they give them chores
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.340]   because that's where they learn responsibility.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.060]   Like that's where they grow in character.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:03.340]   That's where they build some sense of maturity.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.780]   They grow in gratitude.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.260]   That's why they're given chores.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.660]   That's why my dad drug me to our family farm
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.820]   and taught me how to cut firewood as a boy.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.780]   When all of my friends on Saturday mornings
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:17.900]   were snuggled nice in their beds
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.620]   and watching Saturday morning cartoons,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.660]   I was out there in the cold of winter
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.180]   just swinging an ax, just working it, you know?
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.880]   Why did my dad do that to me?
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.820]   Because he cared about me.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.360]   He didn't want me to be like them.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.400]   He wanted me to be better.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.300]   He wanted to complicate my life to clarify my vision.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.100]   Yes, he wanted to teach me things.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.300]   He wanted to grow my character.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.800]   He wanted to like help me learn responsibility.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.600]   But it was in the complication
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.880]   that I only got a vision for those things.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.980]   I got a vision for him.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.920]   I got to learn my dad.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.400]   I got to get to know him.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.560]   I got to understand his character.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.880]   I get to learn from his example.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.920]   And in the process,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.680]   I learned what it meant to navigate the hard together.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.680]   That's what Jesus is doing with this guy.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.840]   Like he complicates his life.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.520]   Jesus tells him to go and to wash in the pool
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.480]   of Siloam, which really doesn't mean much to us.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.000]   Can we just be clear on that?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Like we probably don't have much grasp
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.800]   of ancient Jewish geography.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.040]   This just sounds like, hey, he saw him at the temple
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.880]   and he invited him.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.280]   Hey buddy, let's just, I'll take you by the hand.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.880]   Come on, you know, we'll just walk over here
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.220]   to the pool of Siloam, put some mud, wipe it off.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.060]   You're going to see, you know,
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.480]   like that's what we feel like this is.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.520]   But that is not the case.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.280]   If you go and you look at historical maps,
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:46.320]   what you realize is this is a half mile journey
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.200]   down a 400 foot decline pitch
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.900]   on one of the three busiest days in Jerusalem.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.680]   That's cruel.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.080]   That is unusual punishment.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.000]   Jesus, why would you tell a blind man to do that?
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.240]   That is hard enough for regular people.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.160]   I know folks that can't make that kind of hike today.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.560]   And yet you're asking someone who can't even see
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.000]   to traverse that sort of terrain.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.180]   That feels crazy.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.700]   And yet Jesus cares too much to not complicate his life.
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:22.160]   You see, Jesus is doing this for a very specific purpose.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.720]   Like, couldn't he just snap his fingers,
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.180]   give but a word and give him his sight back?
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.140]   Of course, I know doubt Jesus could do that.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.920]   But therein lies the significance to this story.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.360]   Jesus is less concerned with this man's physical sight.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.680]   And he is more concerned with his spiritual sight.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.640]   He is less concerned with the eyes of his head
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.160]   and more concerned with the eyes of his heart.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.920]   That's what Jesus' aim is.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.400]   And that's his aim for us too.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.480]   Second Corinthians 5, seven, for we,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.660]   those who know the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.720]   we walk by faith, not by sight.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.540]   Hebrews 11, one.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.320]   Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.700]   It's the conviction of things not seen.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.800]   John 20, 29, from Jesus himself, he says,
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:09.000]   "Have you believed because you have seen me?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.320]   Jesus could have solved this man's blindness
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.280]   in but a moment.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.760]   The blindness of his heart,
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.800]   that took a little bit more time.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.040]   I know this lesson really well.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.060]   When my wife and I, Brooke, moved to Houston,
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.200]   we went to work with young adults there.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.640]   People, the exact same stage of life as you.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.300]   As we made our way to Houston, I was pumped.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.720]   I was so excited.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.000]   Like I had been working in college ministry
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.360]   and cutting my teeth and in smaller ways,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.480]   but for the first time I was gonna get to lead and teach
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.320]   and shepherd God's people.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.280]   And I was amped.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.160]   Like I was ready to like kick butt and take names.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.520]   You know, I've walked in, I was like, here I am.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.360]   And yet I was the one whose butt got kicked.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.360]   I was the name that got taken.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.040]   You know, it was so much harder than I expected,
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.120]   especially in my first year.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.080]   And I remember at the end of year one,
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.280]   looking up to God and being like, why?
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.440]   Like, God, why would you do this to me?
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:21.120]   And it's one of the best lessons I've ever learned.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.240]   He taught me in that season,
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:29.040]   "Kylin, I will take you places you would never choose to go
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.640]   to teach you those things
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.080]   you need to know.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.200]   I will lead you into places you would never choose.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.440]   And yet it will be those places that you'll never take back."
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   You see, it was through the pain, not despite it,
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.920]   but through the pain that I learned to trust God,
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.280]   trust Him with my life, trust Him with my future,
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.560]   trust Him with my family.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.480]   In the process of doing so,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.160]   I got a clearer vision of Him.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.000]   Friends, God will complicate your life
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.920]   to clarify your vision.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.480]   He wants you to know Him so much so
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.440]   that He will inconvenience your life
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.160]   and He will disrupt your plans.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.600]   Does that mean it's easy to handle those moments
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.120]   in the future now that we know that?
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:31.240]   No, not at all.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.640]   I was just thinking about this guy's story.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.680]   This is a hard ask.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.280]   Don't you think during his journey to Siloam,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.120]   he probably thought, "Why am I even doing this?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.560]   This is so hard.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:47.920]   I can't even see."
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.760]   Jesus, you couldn't have picked a closer pool.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.600]   There are plenty in Jerusalem for you to choose.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.920]   Why would you pick Siloam?
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.400]   Why are you sending me down this path to this place?
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.760]   Why couldn't you pick something easier?
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.360]   And not only that, Jesus,
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.440]   the thing you're trying to do,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.920]   it's something that no one's ever done before.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.800]   Like, I'm gonna be the first one.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.680]   Hello, everyone.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.840]   I'm the man born blind that was healed.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.520]   History, count my name, it was me.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.480]   No, that's not gonna be the case.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.880]   This feels crazy.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.600]   Why would he do this?
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.160]   Why does this man press on?
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.320]   For this reason, I think, I think,
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.600]   he was desperate enough to keep going.
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.840]   I think he was weary of the hopelessness.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.920]   I think he was tired of his circumstance.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.840]   And he heard from one man a voice and a truth
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.360]   that sounded like the God he had heard for so long say,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.480]   "I can help you take this and go there."
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.920]   And so he did.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.400]   He got up and he moved.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.780]   You see, desperation is a great motivation.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.280]   It'll move you forward.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.000]   It'll keep you going.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.560]   Some of you tonight, like,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.320]   I think that you're in this place.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.800]   Like, amidst the heart of whatever it is you're enduring,
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.040]   the pain of whatever you're feeling,
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.800]   some of you, you are desperate enough like this man
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.540]   in this seat that you're sitting in tonight
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.020]   to humble yourself and just say,
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.320]   "Jesus, I don't know if you can fix me.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.620]   "I don't know if you can heal me.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.280]   "I don't know if you can help me.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.500]   "But God, I know I can't.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.000]   "So I might as well try."
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.180]   Where's Salome?
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.160]   What can I lose?
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.360]   Wrong question.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.720]   It's not what can you lose,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.720]   because you can't lose a thing by trusting in Jesus.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.320]   It's what can you gain, because you can gain everything.
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:48.080]   Which brings me to my third point.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.160]   One touch from God changes everything.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:56.760]   One touch from God changes absolutely everything.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.000]   That's what happens in this story for this guy.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.100]   Look at how the rest of the passage unfolds.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.520]   It starts with an interrogation by the Pharisees.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.520]   It says the Pharisees, they get wind of what happened,
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.280]   that Jesus is out here and he's performing these miracles.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.800]   And rightly so, as religious leaders,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.720]   he's performed enough of these messianic miracles
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.600]   that they should investigate.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.160]   But they don't just investigate, they interrogate this guy.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.660]   Like, there's some pride, there's some ego,
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.720]   there's some platform here
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.400]   that they're worried Jesus is encroaching on.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.840]   And so they gather this guy and they say this.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.760]   They brought to the Pharisees
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.120]   the man who had formerly been blind.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.800]   Now, it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.080]   and he opened his eyes.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.760]   So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.800]   sight and he said to them,
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.560]   he put mud on my eyes and I washed, then I see.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.020]   Some of the Pharisees said, this man is not from God,
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.560]   for he does not keep the Sabbath.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   But others said, how can a man who is a sinner
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:49.280]   do such signs?
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.120]   And there was division among them.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:53.660]   So they said again to the blind man,
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.840]   who's not so blind anymore,
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.080]   what do you say about him since he has opened your eyes?
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.520]   And he said, he's a prophet.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.300]   You see, they can't make sense of it.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.360]   They are so dissatisfied with this guy's answers
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.240]   that they go, and we won't read it for the sake of time,
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.900]   they go from interrogating him
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.480]   to interrogating his parents.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.560]   You know, if he's not gonna tell us the truth,
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.600]   bring in mom and dad, they will tell us the truth.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.640]   Is he suspect?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.600]   Should we trust him?
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.520]   Is he believable?
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.340]   No, okay.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.440]   Like, that's what they're trying to just find a way,
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.180]   a loophole, a path towards manipulating
[00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.440]   around this situation.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.500]   And yet it says there's division among them.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.560]   They cannot agree.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.080]   And so they have him come back.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.920]   And what happens is the interrogation, it escalates.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.640]   It moves from interrogation to intimidation,
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.400]   which is what we see in verse 24.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.720]   So for the second time,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.320]   they called the man who had been blind and said to him,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.720]   give glory to God, which is ironic.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.500]   We know that this man is a sinner, talking about Jesus.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.700]   He answered, whether he's a sinner, I do not know.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.320]   But one thing, there it is.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   One thing I do know, I was blind, but now I see.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:11.300]   They said to him, what did he do to you?
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.220]   How did he open your eyes?
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:15.900]   And he answered them, I have told you already,
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.820]   are you not listening?
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.940]   Why do you want to hear it again?
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.220]   Do you also want to become his disciples?
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.580]   I kind of like this guy, you know,
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.480]   throwing a little jab, a little sarcasm in the mix.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.020]   You can feel the tension in this moment rising.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.100]   Like the Pharisees, they are openly dissatisfied
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.940]   with the man's claims.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.900]   Like they're not just behind hushed doors,
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.540]   talking to each other and saying, we can't make sense of it.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.700]   They are looking at him and they're saying,
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.340]   we can't make sense of this.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.160]   This doesn't compute.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.460]   And yet what happens as he stands
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.460]   before the religious leaders,
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.340]   and they're not only interrogating him,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.020]   they are intimidating him.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.220]   He doesn't back down.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:53.380]   He does not give ground.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.340]   He doesn't bend, he doesn't bow, he doesn't break.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.060]   He stands stalwart.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.180]   Why?
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.480]   Because one touch from God changes everything.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.200]   Which raises an important question for us.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.820]   Why is this his reaction?
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.940]   He was blind.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.500]   What do you think he wanted to see?
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.900]   He got it.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.140]   Like he had already gotten the thing he wanted.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.740]   And so he's in the middle of this interrogation
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.340]   in the process of this intimidation.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.440]   And he has his sight.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.980]   In the midst of this conflict,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.460]   why doesn't he just plead the fifth?
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.020]   Throw Jesus under the bus.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.140]   Sorry, man, it's you or me.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.580]   Why does he go down with the ship
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.460]   when he could just into the trade portal,
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.940]   swap teams and leave Jesus behind and join these guys.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.100]   He has his sight.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.380]   He has what he wants.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:52.500]   Why does he stand in allegiance to Jesus?
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.740]   Because, and this is big,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.100]   and I don't need you to miss this,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.900]   one touch from Jesus,
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.360]   it didn't just change something in this guy's life.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:06.280]   It changed everything in this guy's life.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.200]   Which is a really confronting thought
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.660]   for some of us here tonight.
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.300]   Because if we can be honest with ourselves,
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.660]   some of us just want Jesus to change something.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.740]   Like, Jesus, I don't need you to change everything
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:27.060]   in my life, but I just need you to change something.
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.340]   Like my job, my paycheck, my bank account,
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.020]   my position in the office,
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.360]   maybe move me completely from this city to that city.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.180]   My relationship status would be amazing.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.300]   Can you help me change my body?
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.860]   That'd be great too.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.740]   We just wanted to change something.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.900]   And maybe it's not a tangible something.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.020]   Maybe it's an intangible something.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.700]   Maybe it's Jesus, can you help me change my desire?
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.240]   Can you help me change my dreams?
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.900]   Can you help me change my skills, my giftings, my talents?
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.700]   Can you help me change my reputation, my knowledge?
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.320]   Can you help me change that?
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.060]   Listen, these things are not inherently bad.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.020]   In fact, they're morally neutral.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:08.660]   But if Jesus Christ is not Lord over all of your life,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.620]   then he is not Lord over any part of your life.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.620]   There's one throne in your life
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.180]   and you don't get to sit on it.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:23.660]   It's his, he is king.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.140]   Paul tells us in Philippians 2, 9 through 11,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.700]   "Therefore God has highly exalted him
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.340]   and bestowed on him the name that is above every name
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.860]   so that the name of Jesus, every knee should bow."
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.540]   That's what you do to kings.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.260]   You bow before them in heaven and on earth
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.100]   and under the earth.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.180]   There is no mark of real estate anywhere
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.180]   in all of the cosmos that is excluded from this.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.100]   Everyone will bow the knee
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.100]   and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.300]   to the glory of God the Father.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.780]   If that's not enough, Paul keeps going in Colossians 1.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.500]   He says, "He," talking about Jesus,
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.360]   "is the image of the invisible God,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.820]   the firstborn of all creation.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.460]   For by him, all things were created in heaven and earth,
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.300]   visible and invisible,
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.940]   whether thrones or dominions, rulers or authorities.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:11.940]   All things, all things were created through him and for him.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:16.220]   He is before all things,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.100]   and in him, all things hold together.
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.940]   He is the head of the body, the church.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.340]   He is the beginning.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:24.420]   He is the firstborn from the dead,
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:29.420]   that in everything, in everything, he might be preeminent.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.580]   Jesus is supreme.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.780]   Jesus is king.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.180]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.220]   And he gets to sit on the throne of your life.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.860]   That's why one touch from God changes everything.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.780]   That's what the one thing this man knows.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.340]   He was blind, but now he sees.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:56.180]   And not just physically sees, he spiritually sees.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.540]   Like that's what the Greek in this moment says.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.920]   The word for sight here is blepo,
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.940]   which means that he doesn't just see what's tangible,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.660]   he sees what's true.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.100]   That's what the hand of God does in the life of a person.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.780]   That's what one touch can do for you tonight.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.940]   It can change everything.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:25.640]   It can erupt your rhythms.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.460]   It can disrupt your plans.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:35.260]   And it can lead you into deeper, fuller, more lasting life
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.460]   than you'll find anywhere else.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:41.040]   Than you yourself will ever lead yourself unto.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:46.020]   You see, Jesus Christ, he is the son of God.
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.020]   He is the hero of heaven.
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.340]   He is the light of the world.
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.460]   He is the prince of peace.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.340]   He is the Messiah, according to this text
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.580]   that was sent to save.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.480]   And for this man, and God, I pray for you,
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:04.900]   no amount of interrogation
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:09.540]   and no amount of intimidation could ever sway his allegiance
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:11.120]   from this king.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.000]   Jesus is God become man,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.180]   that man might come to God.
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.780]   And no cost incurred in this world
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:29.500]   is worth the riches of all he affords.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.940]   Even the cost of being cast out,
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:35.640]   which is where the story finishes.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.900]   Like at the very bottom paragraph of this text,
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:43.860]   it says that the Pharisees,
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.380]   they can't make sense with this guy.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.740]   And so what they do is they cast him out.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:52.500]   There's a really detailed explanation
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.420]   of what that kind of casting out means,
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.820]   what that sort of excommunication looks like,
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.860]   according to Pharisaic tradition.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.060]   But for the sake of our time,
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.140]   what you need to know is he is cast out in such a way
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:09.220]   that it's only modern day equivalent is death.
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.340]   He's removed from the synagogue.
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:13.500]   That's what verse 22 tells us.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.320]   He's removed from the Jewish community,
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.500]   that which he has wanted to be a part of.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.340]   And he at last has a chance to because he has his sight.
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.420]   He loses it.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.060]   He's removed from it.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.780]   He is ostracized from community.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.740]   He is cast out of society.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:37.500]   He is alienated and alone, left forbidden on the fringe.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:42.980]   And it's there that Jesus comes to him
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.440]   when no one else wanted him.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.240]   Jesus says, "I want you.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:57.420]   "You may be cast out, but I'm closing in."
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.500]   And as he engages this man, he looks at him.
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.000]   He says, "Hey, do you believe in the Son of Man?"
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.740]   To which this guy responds, "Who is he, sir?
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.740]   "I wanna believe in him, but who is he?"
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:17.260]   And I can just imagine Jesus
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.680]   sitting face to face with this guy,
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.980]   staring into those eyes which now can see.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.540]   (gentle music)
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.240]   He says, "You've already seen him.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:39.180]   "And it is me that is him."
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:50.780]   Friends, don't you know that Jesus Christ
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.460]   has done for him what he wishes to do for you?
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.860]   He wishes to engage you tonight
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.980]   wherever it is you are.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:06.740]   Meet you in that place that you might see him as he is,
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.080]   for that is what he has done in descending from heaven above,
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.340]   coming to earth below, meeting us here,
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:16.020]   fallen, broken, bruised, broken, and busted humanity.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:21.020]   Meeting us in our death,
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.340]   that we might see him in his life
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.140]   and receive that for ourselves too.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.780]   You see, Jesus, he wants for you
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.900]   what he wants for this man.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   He wishes you to know your life is so complicated,
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.180]   but I bore that complication upon the cross
[00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:45.620]   that it might clarify your vision of who it is I am.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.100]   And Jesus wants you to know,
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.900]   just as this man does himself,
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.300]   that one touch from God can change a person forever.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.420]   And Jesus Christ is the gracious hand of God
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.020]   extending to those who feel so far off
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.100]   and yet will be brought home
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.940]   should they place their faith in him
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.460]   and follow him heavenward.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:18.300]   Friends, don't you know,
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.740]   Jesus is the one who has come near
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.300]   to be cast out,
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:31.940]   that we who are cast out might come near.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.660]   This is the heart of our King.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.260]   This is the one thing to know.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:43.580]   If you're blind, tonight you can see.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.660]   One touch, it changes everything.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.900]   How badly do you want for that touch tonight?
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.620]   Let me pray.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:47:00.860]   Father, I just thank you.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   I thank you, God, that in moments like this,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:09.460]   you come close to meet us.
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.580]   People from all walks of life
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.220]   and assortment of backgrounds, God,
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.420]   you come close to meet us here in this moment.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.060]   And yet to teach us that same truth,
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.540]   which we all need despite our diversity,
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:30.700]   which is that one came for all,
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.620]   that all might be united as one under his name.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.100]   Father, I pray that you would move in this moment,
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.780]   that your Holy Spirit would come
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.820]   and would sweep amongst us,
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.460]   that you, God, would have your way
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.780]   amongst my friends here in these seats.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.380]   God, there are some people here tonight
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.260]   that want a fresh touch from you,
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.980]   that want a touch from heaven.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.140]   I pray, God, that you would reach down
[00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.820]   and you would meet them where they are,
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.380]   and you, God, would lift them
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:03.500]   to where you yourself sit tonight.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.940]   Others, God, they're here,
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:13.860]   and God, what they need is humbling.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.980]   I think about the Pharisees in this story,
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   and they have so much line length and page work, God.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.500]   And yet what we see from their example, God,
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.420]   is that spiritual arrogance leads to spiritual blindness.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.260]   I pray, God, that for those in the room
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.780]   that may in fact know you, they would say,
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:38.300]   "Jesus, I'm blinder than I thought.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.620]   "Would you light up my life, give me new sight,
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:43.660]   "and lead me in the way everlasting?"
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:50.060]   For others, tonight, God, is a night of salvation,
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.500]   that they might look to you and say,
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:56.460]   "Jesus Christ, be the Lord of my life.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.220]   "I've reached the end of myself.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.580]   "I am desperate enough to follow.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:03.020]   "It's not what do I have to lose,
[00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.020]   "it's what do I have to gain,
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.620]   "and it's you, my God, that I wish to gain tonight.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.100]   "Save me from my sin, forgive me of my iniquity,
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.100]   "and lead me home that I might be with you forever."
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:19.420]   This room is yours, this people, they're yours.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.820]   Would you sit on the throne of our life, God, we pray.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.100]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
