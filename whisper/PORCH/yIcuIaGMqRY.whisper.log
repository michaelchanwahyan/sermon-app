[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Welcome, Dallas.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.540]   Welcome, Fort Worth.
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.400]   Those tuning in around the country, welcome.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   Welcome, Houston.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.940]   It's great to be with you.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.380]   It's great to worship with you.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.160]   It's great to reflect on the goodness of God with you.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.440]   The last couple weeks, I started talking about
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.840]   moving into a house, and the reason I have,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.880]   this is just kind of a big event in our lives,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.920]   we're actually building a house.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.960]   And so we've never done this before.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.220]   We're new to this game, and so this happened
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.800]   because we had sold a house that we had lived in
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400]   for a little while and made a profit
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.880]   that we wanted to reinvest.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.420]   And then we have some friends, some really good friends
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.600]   who are also builders, which afforded us
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.920]   the opportunity to build a home.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.200]   And so we were excited about that.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.440]   And everybody has kind of set us up
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.960]   for how awful that can be.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.820]   And so they have just said, hey, make sure your marriage
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.660]   is in a good place.
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.000]   I'm like, serious?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400]   Make sure my, okay, it is.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.600]   And so we've kind of started going down this path,
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.440]   and it's been awesome.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.400]   Everything has gone unbelievably smooth,
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.560]   except one thing.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.240]   There's kind of been one hiccup along the way
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480]   as I reflect on this process,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.600]   and really that kind of designing process,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.800]   what's gonna go where.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.320]   And it's not, you know, listen,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200]   it's not gonna be on MTV Cribs or anything,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.360]   or like, you know, parsonage pimped out
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.200]   or anything like that.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.640]   It's just a house.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.080]   But the one thing that's kind of been the hiccup
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.400]   is the lights, where the lights go.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.220]   And here's why.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.100]   Because they're expensive, okay?
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.620]   You have to pay for both the wiring,
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.300]   so the electrical work, and then as well,
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.900]   the fixtures, the light fixtures themselves
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.680]   are very expensive.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.180]   And so here's what I'm trying to do
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.800]   is I'm trying to figure out how we go without.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.240]   I'm like one of the builders, and I'm like,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.760]   do we really need lights?
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.560]   I mean, and so everything, I'm serious,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   this is a real conversation.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.120]   We're looking, and there's like a stairwell,
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.840]   and I'm like, I think we can put one light there.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.480]   And he's like, no, you're gonna need at least three.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.520]   And I'm like, no, just put a bright one, okay?
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.520]   And he's like, bro, your kids are gonna fall down the stairs.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.880]   Like, you need a light.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.840]   And I'm like, okay, fine.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.160]   And he's like, in this bathroom,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.240]   like, we'll put a light here.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.260]   And he's like, you're gonna need two.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.620]   I'm like, listen, we can go potty in the dark, okay?
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.340]   I've done it 1,000 times.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.700]   It can be done, just put one light there.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.980]   And so we're kind of going back and forth on this.
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.060]   And so I show you just kind of the light plans.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.580]   I think we have a picture, so there it is again.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420]   And so those little circles, those are the lights,
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.700]   and then the dotted lines, this is the electrical plans.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.740]   The dotted lines are the wires and whatnot.
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.100]   And this is an intense process.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.000]   You literally sit down and choose
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.940]   where every single light's gonna go,
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.420]   and with every light, I just see dollar signs
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.100]   flying out the window.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.100]   And so we kind of do it, the lights are up,
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.600]   and I'm walking the house now, and it's painted,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.500]   and the lights are there, and I'm with the builder.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.460]   And over the island, if you will, in the kitchen,
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.780]   there's two pendant lights.
[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.060]   Those are these kind of things that hang down.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.100]   And I'm looking at it, and I'm like,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.780]   hey, you know, everything looks good.
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.580]   And the builder's just kind of like looking,
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.440]   and kind of walking around and looking.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.980]   And he's like, those are off.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.860]   And I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.740]   And he's like, well, they're four inches that way.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.820]   They need to be centered, they're four inches off.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.900]   And so everything, it's like painted, okay,
[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.500]   like the sheet rock's there.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.980]   And I'm like, oh, bro, don't worry about it.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.980]   No need to move 'em.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.580]   He's like, no, man, you gotta put 'em in the right place.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.140]   This is a masterful builder who takes pride in his work,
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.880]   and he's like, you've gotta put the light in the right place.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.700]   If you put it where it is, you're not gonna be able
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.880]   to see what you're eating.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.140]   It needs to be four inches this way.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.900]   And so they go and they rewire and tear out the sheet rock
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.860]   and move the pendants four inches toward the island,
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.500]   or at least they're going to.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.480]   Because he takes pride in his work,
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   and he's very, very intentional of where he puts lights.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.580]   God's building something.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.180]   He's building a kingdom of which Jesus is going to come back
[00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.980]   and finish the job.
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.660]   But we start the job.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.360]   As followers of Jesus Christ, if you're here,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.840]   and the Holy Spirit indwells you,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.040]   meaning influences you towards the things of God,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.280]   he's building something, and the metaphor
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.400]   that Jesus uses for you is a light.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.680]   He says, let your light shine before men
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.920]   so that they will glorify your Father in heaven.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   And God is hanging lights throughout this world.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.500]   He has his people throughout this world,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.900]   and we are reflecting the goodness of God
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.820]   and the reality of God through the sharing of the gospel
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.860]   and the building of his kingdom.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.380]   There are dead people walking around us,
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.380]   eternal beings destined for one of two destinations,
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.500]   be it hell or be it heaven.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.180]   And God uses a story, his spirit,
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.980]   breathed in through a narrative which you share,
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.320]   which might determine which is which.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.980]   This is your purpose.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.580]   This is why you have breath in your lungs.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.140]   This is why your heart beats in your chest.
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.820]   This is why the Lord left you here after he saved you,
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.100]   so that you would carry forth this life-saving,
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.200]   eternal-changing, eternity-changing narrative,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.980]   that you would share it.
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.820]   And this is your purpose, and I'm telling you,
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.420]   and I've said it before, a person who lives
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.460]   outside their purpose is a great tragedy.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.580]   It is tragic when you live outside your purpose.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.620]   In fact, you won't experience life in that realm.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.060]   You won't really understand while you're here.
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.820]   You'll look for purpose in work
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.460]   and in all of these other things, and you will miss it,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.700]   because God has given you an eternal purpose,
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.820]   a purpose that extends past your hobbies,
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.900]   extends past your likes, extends past your job
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.540]   or your occupation or your talents or your gifts,
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.700]   something much, much bigger than you.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:37.420]   I've heard it said that you are a missionary
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.660]   or a mission field.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.840]   Spurgeon said every Christian is a missionary or an imposter.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.340]   I'm telling you that you are a missionary or you need one.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.740]   The very essence of Christianity is sharing Christ
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.260]   with those who do not know him, and so tonight,
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.580]   we're talking about the reality that you are the light,
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.300]   that God left here, that you carry forth the gospel,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.060]   that you show the world the love of Jesus,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.020]   and so I'll share with you some statistics.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.420]   Lifeway Research Group did this survey in 2013,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.900]   and they said 80% of Christians
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.260]   believe they have a personal responsibility
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.340]   to share their faith.
[00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.780]   80% of Christians believe they have a personal responsibility
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.620]   to share their faith.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.400]   When I heard that statistic,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.100]   I thought 20% of Christians aren't Christians,
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.860]   'cause how can you be a Christian and not believe
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.660]   that you have a responsibility to share your faith?
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.000]   And while 80% believe that they do,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.820]   it says that only 39% of Christians
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.660]   have shared with at least one person in the past six months,
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.420]   which means to me 61% of Christians aren't being Christian.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.300]   They're not being very Christian,
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.500]   and so we're starting a new series tonight.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   This series comes from Romans 1, verse 16, unashamed,
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.360]   or we're calling it unashamed.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.640]   You're gonna hear more about the origination of this series,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.060]   where it came from, some tonight,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:14.900]   some in the weeks ahead.
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.780]   We'll be here three weeks, but it's actually based on,
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.820]   and not to be confusing, 'cause I just said Romans 1:16,
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.940]   it's actually based on Acts 1:8.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.040]   Acts 1:8 is the Great Commission in the Acts accounts, okay?
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.540]   And so as the apostles lived it,
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.580]   the Great Commission is right before Jesus goes up
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.540]   to be with God at the right hand of God in heaven,
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.420]   before he ascends, he tells his followers,
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.060]   hey, you're to go into all the earth
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.460]   and teach them the very things that I taught you,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.100]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.240]   and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.140]   If you are here and you're going to be with God
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.340]   forever in heaven, it is because of the faithful work
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.860]   of those men living out that mission,
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.580]   being unashamed of the gospel.
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.860]   Acts 1:8, now the account in Acts, reads like this.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.940]   They come to him, they say, Jesus,
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.780]   are you going to restore the kingdom?
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.340]   Right now is now the time you're going to restore the kingdom
[00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.260]   and he says, no, I'm gonna go away.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.640]   But one's going to come to you, he says this,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.900]   and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem,
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.180]   and in Judea, and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.380]   And so as we do this series, the first week,
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.780]   we're gonna talk about our Jerusalem,
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.060]   the places that we are.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.500]   This is where the apostles were, their Jerusalem.
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.020]   Judea and Samaria was the area that was entrusted to them,
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.480]   and then all the ends of the earth
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.460]   is how the Gentiles essentially heard the gospel,
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.620]   that's you and I, because they lived out this mission.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.640]   They had passed the torch to you.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.860]   They carried it with their life.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.760]   It cost them their life, by the way.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.740]   And they've carried it forward and it's now reached you.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.380]   What are you going to do with it?
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.080]   Have a big party and go home, make a million dollars,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.820]   you know, live quietly in the neighborhood.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.540]   What are you going to do with this torch
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.380]   that people have entrusted to you, cost them their lives?
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:15.620]   These were young adults, essentially nobodies,
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.780]   people, the ones that rabbis had forgotten.
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.900]   They didn't have a lot of money.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.740]   They were 20s and 30-somethings.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.200]   And when they understood who Jesus was,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.140]   they said, man, I will give my life to that.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.060]   Church isn't something that I'm just gonna go to.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.560]   Church is something I am.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.800]   Before I'm anything, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.660]   This is my prayer for us this evening.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.820]   And so in this series, we will cover your Jerusalem
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.300]   tonight, your Judea and Samaria next week,
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.980]   and then the ends of the earth.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.700]   Tonight, specifically, we're going to talk
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.140]   about your purpose, the place of which
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.500]   you will live out that purpose,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.100]   and the people and the place of which
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.780]   you will live out that purpose.
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.380]   So your purpose, your place, and your people.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.860]   I'm gonna be in Acts, I mean, sorry,
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.260]   Matthew 5, if you want to turn there.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.340]   This is the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.700]   Matthew, first book of the New Testament,
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.260]   chapter five, verse 13.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.660]   Jesus is teaching, this is a sermon.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.300]   Jesus gave this sermon, okay, the most famous sermon
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.940]   in the history of history, the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.780]   This is an excerpt from the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.300]   of which, if you were there, I don't think
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.820]   you'd go home and be like, oh my goodness,
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.420]   I just heard this amazing speaker today.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.220]   He called me salt and light, it was amazing.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.700]   No, I think you'd be like, what?
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.540]   What does that even mean?
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.100]   And so tonight, we're gonna talk about what it means.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.140]   He says, verse 13.
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.860]   You are the salt of the earth,
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.580]   but if the salt loses its saltiness,
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.500]   how can it be made salty again?
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.740]   It is no longer good for anything,
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.220]   except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.260]   There's a lot going on here.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.420]   You're like, okay, Jesus just called me
[00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.700]   that little canister by the pepper, that's weird, Jesus.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.420]   What are you saying there?
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.380]   And so salt in this community, it was very valuable.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.860]   First of all, soldiers were paid in salt.
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.100]   If you've ever heard a man's not worth his salt,
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.740]   or is he worth his salt, that comes from this reality
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.740]   that the Roman soldiers were paid in salt.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.620]   We get the word salary from the word salt.
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.540]   Okay, interesting.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.500]   And so what they would do is salt there was not mined,
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.180]   it came from the ocean.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.300]   So they would go in the ocean,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.340]   this is the area, think of the Dead Sea,
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.460]   where it's salt, very salty water.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.300]   They would go and get plants from the ocean,
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.700]   and they would rub it on their meat.
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.900]   And what it would do is it would preserve the meat.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.340]   It would keep the meat from rotting.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.580]   And then when they were done rubbing it on the meat,
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.460]   if it wasn't salty anymore,
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.140]   they would then throw it on their flat thatched roof.
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.540]   And what it would do is as people would walk
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.860]   on top of the roofs, it would trample the things
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.980]   that were salty so that it would seal their roof.
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.180]   And so this is the metaphor,
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.220]   the imagery that Jesus is giving it.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.020]   He's saying, hey, the purpose of salt
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.020]   is to preserve things from rotting.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.220]   But after you have used it, after it has served its purpose,
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.140]   it goes on its roof, on the roof, and it is purposeless.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.260]   In fact, the very word for good here
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.620]   is the same word that we see in Acts 1:8 for power.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.860]   It says, it is no longer good for anything.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.620]   And it's the same word we see in Acts 1:8
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.100]   where it says you will receive power.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.580]   You will receive purpose.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.780]   Here in Matthew 5, it is no longer purposeful for anything.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.860]   It has lost its purpose.
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.740]   So what is your purpose?
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.420]   Your purpose is to remain salty.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.660]   And what does that mean in context?
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.180]   To preserve, to preserve what?
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.020]   To preserve the reality and the things of God
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.220]   in a culture that is quickly losing them.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.220]   My first point this evening is you have a purpose.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.460]   You have a purpose.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.460]   You must understand what your purpose is.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.180]   I know you think that your purpose
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:06.020]   is to make a lot of money.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.980]   I know you think your purpose is to have a lot of friends
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.220]   or a lot of Facebook likes
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.940]   or a really good Instagram account
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.140]   or whatever you might think your purpose is,
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.460]   to have a BMW or something.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.460]   I don't know, but your purpose has been given to you
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.980]   by God for God.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.900]   You can't miss that.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.100]   God the creator gave you a purpose.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.100]   That purpose is for him.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.900]   And so there's two metaphors that Jesus uses here.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.780]   The first one is salt,
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.540]   and then the next one we'll talk about is actually light.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   And so we are preserving a culture in America.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.900]   Do you know, and I just want you to think about this.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.620]   You probably, you might even disagree right now.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.020]   Go home and think about it.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.420]   What people like about America is not America.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.860]   It's not an American culture.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.180]   It's a Christian culture.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.660]   It's a godly culture.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.140]   It's the things of God
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.020]   that have been preserved in our culture.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.980]   And you're like, well, wait a minute, hold on.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.820]   What did you say?
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.740]   There have been places
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.620]   where there has been a Christian culture.
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.100]   It has now left.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.680]   Like if you go to parts of Europe right now,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.900]   churches are like museums.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.820]   They're like ruins.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.500]   You would go there, but not to worship.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.060]   You would go there to see the architecture.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.020]   You would go there to see the statues.
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.820]   You might go there to see a painting,
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.100]   but you're not there to worship.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   In fact, no one really goes there to worship
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.160]   because it has moved on.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.220]   The spirit of God has moved on.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.060]   It's headed west.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.420]   It came here to America.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.960]   And it's probably leaving,
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.660]   unless you do something about it,
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.860]   unless you begin to preserve this culture
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.340]   that has been entrusted to us.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.260]   If you look at Amsterdam today,
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.180]   that's probably the future of America.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.260]   Things of the red light district,
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.120]   the freedom and tolerance and all of those things
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.820]   that generation Y and millennials,
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.380]   that you and your peers celebrate,
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.740]   but don't fully understand.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.300]   You look at Syria,
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.380]   where people are losing their head
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.080]   because they're a Christian.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.640]   That's the future of Amsterdam.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.020]   This is what happens when a place is Christian,
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.540]   when they understand what they believe
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.420]   and why they live,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.820]   and they're preserving that culture,
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.220]   and then it leaves and it moves on.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.520]   Darkness is left.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.060]   The world that your children will be raised in
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.260]   will be very different from the world
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.820]   that you were raised in,
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.020]   unless you get this.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.380]   As millennials, I've told you before,
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.300]   we're poised well for a great awakening,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.100]   a revival, that this country would return back to God.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:56.060]   The reality of God has been preserved here by believers.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.660]   I'm talking about in America.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:58.640]   Lots of examples of this.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.060]   In God we trust on our money,
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.040]   of one nation under God and our pledge.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.960]   Even in our language, things we say,
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.940]   like the blind leading the blind.
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.140]   This comes from the scriptures,
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:07.980]   an eye for an eye.
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.140]   This comes from Jesus.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.300]   These were things he said
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.780]   that are just kind of indwelled in our culture.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.100]   People say, I see the writing on the wall.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.620]   Okay, those sayings come from the scriptures.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.900]   The apple of my eye,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.540]   out of the mouths of babes.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.820]   There's lots of examples of these things that we say
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.360]   that actually come from the Bible
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.500]   that have been preserved in the culture that we live in.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.100]   And did you know that about every 10 years,
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.100]   someone raises their hand,
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.660]   some expert atheist, and says,
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.660]   hey, the Bible will soon be irrelevant.
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.260]   In fact, it was Voltaire in the 1700s
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.780]   who said in 10 years, no one will be buying the Bible.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.320]   No one will be reading the Bible.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.860]   It will be completely irrelevant.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.980]   This was in the 1700s.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.540]   Today, 2014, is the bestseller.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.500]   Not only the bestseller in the history of the world,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.940]   the bestseller in 2014, the most read book,
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.540]   the most downloaded book, by about a margin of a billion.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.500]   Okay, so second place isn't even really that close.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.380]   And it's not even another book that you might think.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.460]   It's not a book like the Quran.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.500]   That's not second place.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.340]   They've been wrong.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.500]   The Bible's not going anywhere.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.600]   I've read the back of the book.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.700]   I know how this thing ends.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.280]   Like Jesus comes back, white horse, you know,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.900]   sword, crazy out of his mouth, robe dripped in blood,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.900]   tattoo on his thigh, it's gonna be nuts.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.540]   (congregation laughing)
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.500]   Like we know how this ends.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.660]   And so you just get to play a part in it.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.580]   Do I play a part in creating a place
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.080]   that Jesus is gonna return to?
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.300]   Or do I play a part in losing it
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.900]   with the peace that has been entrusted to me?
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.960]   Do I preserve it?
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.780]   Or do I not?
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.940]   As a follower of Jesus Christ, it's not really an option.
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.840]   Your purpose is to preserve and share the realities of God.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.360]   And so in your purpose at work,
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.840]   wherever you went today, wherever you came here from,
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:53.680]   your purpose there,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.000]   there in the middle of it is an eternal purpose.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.400]   And the purpose of your hobbies,
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.200]   be it wakeboarding or art or whatever your hobbies are,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.400]   in the middle of that is an eternal purpose.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.100]   Something that God has entrusted to you,
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.980]   plans that he has for you that he prepared
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.940]   before the creation of the world, Ephesians 2:10,
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.880]   "For we are God's masterpiece,
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.940]   "his workmanship created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.600]   "which he has prepared in advance for us to do."
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.400]   This is your purpose,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.300]   that you would preserve the realities of him.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.420]   And this is why some people name their kids biblical names,
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.180]   preserving a culture.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.420]   There's not a lot of Judas's running around.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.920]   I don't know if you haven't noticed that.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.260]   There's not, there are a lot of Matthews,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.580]   there are a lot of Johns,
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.220]   not many Judas's.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.560]   This is why about 50 of you,
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.680]   every couple months,
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.940]   give up your weekend to go and share the gospel
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.100]   on the street in a weekend we call Unashamed Weekend.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.020]   I wanna tell you how that started.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.020]   If you haven't heard about it,
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.300]   we do this deal called Unashamed,
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.540]   and it's where we go and we live kind of in West Dallas,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.740]   and we do service projects,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.580]   and throughout the day,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.960]   we just share the gospel with people
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.580]   in the very places that you might go out in,
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.900]   like Uptown and Lower Greenville and Deep Ellum,
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.740]   and we're just like,
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.880]   "Hey, can we talk to you about Jesus?"
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.720]   Not in weird ways,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.820]   but, "Hey, what are you doing?
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.060]   "Hey, I'd like to get to know you,
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.660]   "and by the way, I know how you can live forever."
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.580]   And so, as we do that,
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.620]   I wanna tell you how that started.
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.460]   We were in Haiti, okay?
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.300]   And so there was a group of us,
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.140]   a group of porch leaders,
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.620]   we were in Haiti,
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.540]   and we were in this village,
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.460]   and there was this interpreter there named Villerson,
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.460]   and so Villerson is our guy who is our translator,
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.680]   and we're going kind of door to door in Haiti,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.480]   and it's really frustrating
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.200]   sharing the gospel through an interpreter.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.040]   I don't know if you've ever done it,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.200]   but you're like, "Hey, God loves you so much,
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.540]   "and you've been separated from him by your sin,
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.260]   "and he loves you so much,
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.720]   "he sent Jesus, where was I?
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.200]   "Jesus to die for his sin."
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.040]   It's just real frustrating.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.920]   So Villerson, who became a friend of ours,
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.720]   and was a Christian, was a Christ follower,
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.360]   he knew the gospel clearly, right?
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.580]   And so I'm like, "Dude, these are your people,
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.420]   "just tell them."
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.040]   And this particular village that we were in,
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.880]   it was his village,
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.000]   it was the village where he was from.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.480]   And so I was sitting there,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   and I'm like, "Hey, Villerson,
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.220]   "I don't wanna do the whole interpreter game,
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.980]   "just tell them the gospel.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.380]   "Just tell them what Jesus has done for them."
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.840]   And that night we were kind of debriefing
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.600]   that frustration among our team.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.520]   And several felt it,
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.560]   talking to people and not understanding the language.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.400]   And I told them, I'm like,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.880]   "Hey, I just told Villerson, man, just tell him."
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.700]   And one of the guys said,
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.980]   "Hey, you know you're asking him
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.060]   "to knock on his neighbor's door
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.600]   "and just share the gospel."
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.420]   I said, "Yeah, exactly,
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.960]   "that's exactly what I'm asking him to do."
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.480]   He goes, "But we don't do that."
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.200]   And I said, "Be quiet, young man, you will not know."
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.160]   I said, "You're exactly right, we don't do that."
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.400]   My friend Ryan Wall and Allie Wall,
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.420]   who are on our staff now,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.460]   they were there, they weren't on our staff then.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.320]   And Ryan just said, "When we get back to Dallas,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.600]   "we're going to do that."
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.000]   We're going to move throughout the streets
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.600]   of Dallas and Fort Worth,
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.040]   and we're going to declare the gospel,
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.500]   'cause I cannot ask this young man to do it,
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.360]   unless I'm willing to do that.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:11.300]   And so Unashamed Weekend was born.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.640]   Because I see the same frustrations
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.560]   every single time I return from one of these trips.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.120]   People get back on the airplane,
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.820]   and they usually had a life-changing time.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.920]   In fact, in a few weeks, I'm going to tell all of you,
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.920]   if you haven't been overseas
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.400]   for the purpose of sharing the gospel, let's go.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.300]   But they get on the plane,
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.440]   and there's a point of frustration,
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.760]   'cause they say, they wish two things.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.120]   I've heard it over and over.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.760]   I wish I understood the language.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.600]   I wish I could share with them in their own language.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.040]   And I wish I understood the culture.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.800]   And the irony.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.720]   We get on an airplane to return back to a place
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.120]   where we understand the culture,
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.440]   and we speak the language.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.240]   We're not taking the gospel to Haiti.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.560]   It's already there.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.800]   There are churches in Haiti.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.400]   We're not taking the gospel to Haiti
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.500]   any more than we are Dallas or Fort Worth.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.100]   We are preserving a culture of Christ in Haiti,
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.120]   exactly as we should in Dallas and Fort Worth.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.140]   And do you know something else
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.480]   that happens every single time?
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.920]   Every trip I've been on, the same conversation happens.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.280]   People come up to me, and they're so excited.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.120]   They say, JP, JP, bro,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.080]   I've never felt so alive.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.680]   Woke up in the morning.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.640]   God helped me share the gospel faithfully and courageously.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.800]   Go to breakfast, hey, who can I share the gospel with?
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.200]   Go to lunch, who can I share the gospel?
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.880]   Go to dinner, who can I share the gospel with?
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.640]   All in between.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.480]   Go to bed.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.080]   JP, I've never felt so alive.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.960]   I say, that's because for the first time
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.920]   you are living within your purpose.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.520]   And I want you to be abundantly clear
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.980]   as to what they're saying.
[00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.880]   Some of you, you need to take this personally.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.920]   They're saying, I've found life in a way that you haven't.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.760]   Many of you.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:04.880]   I have found life to the fullest and abundantly
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.400]   in a way that many of you haven't
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.800]   as you continue to pursue life in uptown
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.480]   and lower Greenville and Deep Ellum
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.140]   or wherever that may be, Addison.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.040]   Or in Fort Worth, Sundance Square,
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.520]   or Billy Bob's or wherever in Fort Worth.
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.560]   They say, hey, I found something
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.400]   that you haven't yet found.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:30.200]   I found life in a more bigger way than you have.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.440]   And I'm just standing up here saying,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   man, I want that for you.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.560]   I want that for you every day, every week.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.160]   I've never known life like this,
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.100]   life of sharing my faith.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.960]   Your purpose is to show Christ to a world
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.840]   that desperately needs him.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.760]   Yesterday, as I was preparing for this message,
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.480]   I wanted to be in the city, so I was at Mudsmith
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.160]   down in lower Greenville and bumped into a guy
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.480]   who goes here and he just said,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.400]   hey, what is your favorite thing
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.760]   about doing ministry with young adults?
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.720]   I said, easy, bro.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.020]   Easy, man.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.820]   Watching them be repurposed.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.320]   He said, what do you mean?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.960]   I was like, watching folks who come in,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.320]   they're like the rich young ruler,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.040]   like they have all these gifts and talents
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.440]   and they're so focused on using them for them
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.640]   and they like think they're Christian,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.900]   but they've never lived Christian.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.480]   They just kind of go on to church
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.840]   every now and then, maybe every weekend.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.480]   And watching them really get it,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.220]   get lit up with the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.160]   like ready to just run through walls for the sake of Jesus
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.680]   and tell everybody, their coworker,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.720]   lose their job sharing the gospel.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.640]   Watching them find life for the first time,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.420]   find purpose for the first time.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.020]   Hands down, my favorite thing.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:44.480]   Jesus goes, verse 14.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.600]   You're the light of the world.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.960]   A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.520]   Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.160]   Instead, they put it on its stand
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.760]   and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.280]   And so Jesus is talking now
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.120]   about the specific positioning of the light.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.200]   He's saying, hey, if you're a light,
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.640]   you have to give off light.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.740]   A light that doesn't give off light is not a light.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.480]   It's a bulb, you know, it's not a light.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.120]   A light gives off light.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.460]   And so if you're a Christian, you give off light.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.240]   You are by which, the way by which people see.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.800]   You are drawing them to Christ.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:19.640]   You think about this,
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.880]   like we are people obsessed with lights, right?
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.640]   Some of you are like, I just, I got that.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.520]   Like half of you just went, huh?
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.760]   Let me explain it.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.600]   You ever heard this?
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.600]   Oh, come out here, you gotta see the stars.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.820]   Oh, hey, do you wanna go look at Christmas lights?
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.840]   Hey, guess what?
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.200]   Kaboom town, man.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.880]   Fireworks.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.980]   Lights in the sky.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.820]   Well, you get it?
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.660]   We are a people obsessed with lights.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.060]   We're like moths, man, light.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.820]   You know?
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.900]   Moth to a flame, we are.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.280]   And so if you're a light, people are drawn to you, right?
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.500]   And Jesus is just saying,
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.740]   hey, I put lights in real specific places.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.740]   So my second point is, you have a place.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.820]   You have been entrusted with a place.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.540]   In the first century, lights were very expensive.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.200]   In 2014, lights are still very expensive.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.580]   They typically had one in their house
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:24.180]   and they would put it where it really mattered.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.340]   They would never put it under something.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.500]   Jesus is saying something preposterous.
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.940]   He was like, you would never do this.
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.360]   In the same way, I put lights in very specific places.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.140]   Just like I put them in specific places in my house,
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.300]   God put them specific places in the world.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.900]   Now, I will tell you, some burn brighter than others.
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.180]   Some shine a little brighter than others.
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.380]   But for you not to share your faith
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.280]   is as crazy as installing a light under a couch
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.420]   or under a chair.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.520]   You would never do it.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.680]   So as you live out your purpose,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.940]   you live out your purpose in the place that God has put you.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.580]   Acts 17, verse 26, just to show you how profound and real
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.180]   this idea is that God has given you a place, it says this.
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.400]   From one man he made all the nations, he being God,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.620]   that they should inhabit the whole earth.
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.440]   And he marked out their appointed times in history.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.420]   That's 2014 for you and me.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.740]   And the boundaries of their lands.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:25.460]   He established when you would live and where you would live
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.580]   before the creation of the world.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.980]   God, who is sovereign and has a plan for you,
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.800]   determined when you would live,
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.620]   when you would actually exist in history
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.020]   and where you would live.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.580]   He determined your boundaries.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.620]   So what do I mean by boundaries?
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.540]   Do I just mean Dallas?
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540]   Do I just mean Fort Worth?
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.220]   No, I mean not just your neighborhood,
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.980]   not just your apartment complex, I mean your Starbucks.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.040]   I mean your Tom Thumb or Kroger, your grocery store.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.020]   Do you see that?
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.620]   I mean that your gas station, the place that you go back to,
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.500]   your anthropology or your mall
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.160]   or whatever that is for you, right?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.860]   That place that you go where they like know you,
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.700]   you walk, oh hey, what's up, Chris?
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.540]   Hey, what's up?
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.040]   That's your boundaries.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.820]   And he did it intentionally.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.460]   He put you there intentionally,
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.740]   your job where you go to every single day.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:24.980]   Is God intentionally moving through your life
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.300]   like you're a pawn on a chessboard and he's moving you?
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:31.860]   He's like do battle here, shine light here,
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.300]   shine light here.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.940]   I really hope for some of you right now
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.860]   it's like there's a light bulb going off
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.400]   and you're like oh man, I've gotta change the way I shop.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.660]   I've gotta change the way I get gas.
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.860]   I've gotta change the way I get coffee.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.580]   There's more purpose in this than I actually thought.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.940]   Lights also push back darkness.
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.500]   That's what they do where there's light,
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   darkness can't be and our country's growing dim.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.100]   It's only because people have stopped shining.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.540]   That's it.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.180]   One generation, that's what they're saying about you, man.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.660]   That's what they're saying about you and your peers.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.180]   There's a concentration of Christianity happening.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.700]   Let me explain.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.540]   All these people who went through the world
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.620]   calling themselves Christians
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.060]   are kind of realizing they're not
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.020]   and so they're saying no, I'm not anymore.
[00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.540]   And that's not altogether bad
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.140]   because some of you in your 20s and 30s,
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.780]   you're realizing you are
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.140]   and you're rejecting cultural Christianity
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.060]   and it's affecting the way you date,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.500]   the way you shop, the way you live,
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.780]   the way you share, the way you shine.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.020]   And you're saying I will give my life for this Jesus.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.300]   I will die for this Jesus.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.780]   And that is the call on your life.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.660]   Yeah, you guys can clap for that if you believe that.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.220]   (congregation applauding)
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:11.100]   Some of you are like, but JP, my work, it's so dark.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.380]   Good, God put a light there in you.
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.700]   Corporate America is the darkest mission field
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.540]   I've ever seen.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.740]   I live there, I work there.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.700]   Just to quantify that, I mean, I've been to Africa,
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.940]   I've been to the jungles of Africa, the bush of Africa.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.900]   I've been to Haiti, I've been to the Amazon jungle,
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.460]   I've been to Brazil, I've been down the Amazon for four days
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.460]   to reach a people that have never been reached.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.460]   I've been to Mexico for the purpose of sharing the gospel.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.300]   I've been to these places,
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.460]   the darkest mission field I've ever seen
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.460]   was right here in DFW.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.020]   And you know what's crazy?
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.700]   Let me tell you something that's crazy.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.460]   Today, right now, I could go to Brazil, I could go to Haiti,
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.420]   I could go to Africa, I could go to places
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.700]   where the UN would say, don't go here.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.740]   Our government would say, no, don't go to that place.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.740]   And I could go there, I mean, I could get a visa
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.260]   to Brazil today, I could go to the Congo,
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:13.420]   I mean, purchase a plane ticket, I could be there tomorrow.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.220]   That's what's crazy.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.700]   You know one place I can't be?
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:22.620]   The eighth floor of AT&T where I worked for four years,
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.060]   every day.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.900]   Because I'd have to go through security, I had this badge
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.820]   and I would swipe it and go through security
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.220]   and I was there every single day in this cube farm.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.180]   And today, I can't be there.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:38.220]   I can't, and I'm not even sure, let me strike that.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.060]   I'm certain that I wasn't as faithful
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.220]   as I should have been.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:48.540]   I'm certain that there are people who God wanted to save
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.140]   and they're not saved right now
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.420]   because I didn't faithfully share with them.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.420]   Because I pursued my comfort
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.140]   and I thought it might be awkward.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.220]   I love what David said a couple months ago,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.620]   he's like, man, I don't know,
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.340]   like it would be really difficult to explain
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.580]   to the Apostle Paul why we didn't share the gospel.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.260]   He'd be like, whoa, because they're gonna put you in prison?
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.220]   You're like, no.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.180]   Because they're gonna torture you?
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.860]   You're like, no, not really.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.660]   But why, why aren't you sharing?
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.940]   That's awkward.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.220]   You know, I'm not sure you'd understand what that means.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.340]   I'm not sure you'd get it.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.140]   And it's awkward because we haven't been loving
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.100]   in the places that have been entrusted to us.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.300]   It's not awkward when you've been like
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.380]   the hardest worker there
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.940]   and caring for your employees so well
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.140]   that they're like, man, I'll trust you
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.980]   with anything you say.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.940]   What, this dude died and came back to life?
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.900]   Okay, I'm in.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.460]   It's not awkward when we're lights
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.820]   and we're shining brightly.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.140]   It's less awkward.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.260]   So I can't go to the eighth floor of AT&T
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.020]   where I was every day, five days a week
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:02.300]   with the people there working with them every day.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.660]   I also can't go behind the counter at Starbucks
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.500]   where you might be.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.660]   I also can't go into that restaurant
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.460]   with those servers back into the kitchen.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.340]   I also can't go to that building
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:12.500]   that you've been entrusted to
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.860]   or Dallas ISD in the teacher's lounge
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.860]   or Richardson ISD or wherever it is that you work
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.700]   or you hang out with those engineers
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.580]   or those other financial advisors
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.740]   or whatever it is that you do.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.860]   I'm not there.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.420]   But God put a light there
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.220]   and he put a light there to shine.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:33.380]   That's your place.
[00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:39.020]   In the same way, verse 16,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.900]   let your light shine before others
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.820]   that they may see your good deeds
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.820]   and glorify your Father in heaven.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:50.100]   I wanna ask a question around this line.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.660]   It says, one you may have heard before.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.860]   Let your light shine before others
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.020]   that they may see your good deeds
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.500]   and glorify your Father in heaven.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:01.300]   Who are the others and who are the they?
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.620]   Let your light shine.
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.100]   Who am I supposed to let my light shine before?
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.900]   It says others and they.
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.220]   And my third point is you have people.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.940]   You have a people and a place
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.740]   that you're to live out your purpose with.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.420]   There are people in the places that you go to,
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.100]   the boundaries that have been marked out for,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.660]   where you are to live out your purpose
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.020]   of being salt and light.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.020]   You have a people.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.540]   And so who are the others and the they?
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.580]   They're your people.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.980]   And so like where is that?
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   Well, where do light shine?
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.700]   Simply put, like your headlights,
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.980]   they shine right in front of you.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.140]   Lights in a house, they shine where they're put,
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:39.460]   where they're placed.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.580]   And so wherever you are, wherever place you're in,
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:46.660]   the people around you, they are the darkness
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.140]   and you are the light.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.540]   You are the way that they are going to see the way
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.380]   to eternity.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.420]   There's not another plan.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:02.100]   Okay, I've read that if you don't share, rocks will cry out.
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.060]   But right now, rocks aren't crying out, it's just you.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.260]   You're the light there.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.860]   God said, hey, I love you and trust you so much,
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.660]   I put people around you, that you would shine a light
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.300]   into their heart so that they might see
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   how they could live with me forever.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.100]   That you would be the light that they're drawn to,
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.620]   like fireworks, like Christmas lights, like stars.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:31.140]   And Dallas, I assume Fort Worth is so dark,
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.820]   if you just shine at all, you're probably gonna stand out.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.380]   If you just shine a little bit, you're gonna stand out.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.220]   They're gonna see you, man.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.860]   There's something different about this one.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.380]   Hey man, let me ask you a question.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.780]   Why don't you go party with them?
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.500]   Don't you know we were at Happy Hour last night?
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.220]   Dude, I got wasted, it was so fun.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.780]   Man, Mary had that lampshade on her head, it was crazy.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.140]   How come you weren't there?
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.660]   Hey man, let me ask you.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.340]   I noticed that you get here early,
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.020]   and you just work harder than everyone else.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.700]   Almost like you're not working for man,
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.380]   but working for something else.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.340]   Hey man, I just noticed the way that you love,
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.660]   like you're so intentional with the dude
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.980]   who never goes to lunch, like you ask him to lunch.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.420]   It seems like you just can care,
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.740]   like you're not trying to get,
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.420]   you're not so concerned about yourself,
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.900]   you're concerned about everyone else around you.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.420]   Like why do you do that?
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.380]   Why do you shine so bright?
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:25.180]   What are you doing?
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.340]   Who do you worship?
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.380]   How can I worship him?
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.820]   Who are your people?
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.660]   Three groups, I believe.
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.500]   I'll go through this quickly.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.900]   The first one is your family.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.980]   If you trusted Christ late in your life,
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.460]   your family should see a change in you.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.420]   I will tell you, I believe family is the most difficult.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.260]   Jesus said that a prophet is not welcome in his own town,
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.860]   and referring to family,
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.060]   or those there that have rejected him,
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.300]   that know him, that knew him the closest.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.020]   But you share with love,
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.860]   you share consistently,
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.660]   and don't fall into old traps.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.500]   See, I know it's like, well, I'm the baby of the family,
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.740]   like that, I've never just really kind of grown past that.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.340]   Listen, share with love, share consistently,
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.460]   and don't fall into old traps.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.620]   What I mean by old traps is like,
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.260]   if you and your dad always get into an argument,
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.140]   like, avoid that argument, and say,
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.340]   hey, I'm sorry, will you forgive me?
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.940]   Like, growing up, I did these things, will you forgive me?
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.260]   But I found something really good
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.140]   that I want you to know about.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.660]   I want you to know there's been a change in my life
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:28.780]   I wanna share with you.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.460]   The second group is your neighbors.
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.660]   Guys, this is the layup, man.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.020]   Do you know your neighbors?
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.340]   Like, do you know the people that live
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.460]   on both sides of you, and above you, and below you?
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.300]   Do you know them?
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.860]   And I don't mean do you know their names.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.780]   I mean, do you know them?
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.940]   Do you know what they love to do?
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.580]   Do you know what religion they are?
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.580]   Oh, you're Muslim?
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.740]   Man, I'd love to hear about that.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.700]   How did you become Muslim?
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.540]   Were you raised Muslim?
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.700]   What did that look like?
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.140]   Oh, you're of the Baha'i faith?
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:54.460]   What is the Baha'i faith?
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.420]   Tell me about that.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.900]   Hey, do you wanna come over and have dinner
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.940]   with me and my roommates this weekend?
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.100]   Man, I'd love to get to know you.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.540]   God, in his sovereignty, placed me right next door to you.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.740]   And some of us are just like,
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.940]   you want me to go and share with the people
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.580]   who are always so loud?
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.740]   Yes.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.060]   Plainly put, yes.
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.500]   Yeah, the people, they constantly make all the noise
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.900]   above you.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.900]   Go love on them and tell them about Jesus,
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.100]   and maybe they'll stop making so much noise.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.620]   And share with your coworkers.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.020]   We talked a lot about this.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.100]   Third group, your coworkers, your people.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:39.380]   The people on the other side of the cube from you,
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.820]   the people on the other side of the wall from you,
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:44.060]   that other barista, that other teacher,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.180]   that other financial advisor, that other engineer,
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.020]   that other artist, that other graphic designer,
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.780]   whatever you are.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.940]   The other one, the one around you,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.620]   the one that's right there every single day,
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:39:59.660]   the one you like, the one you don't like.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.540]   Do you know them?
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.020]   Not their name, do you know their upbringing?
[00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.140]   Do you know where they're from?
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.300]   Do you know what they do?
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.580]   Do you love them?
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.980]   This is what it looks like to be salt and light.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.300]   Do you actually care where they're going to spend eternity?
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:22.700]   I heard a guy say, as an atheist,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.540]   say how much do you have to hate someone not to tell them?
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.860]   Man, you've been given grace.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.700]   Someone shared with you.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.580]   Can you imagine if they hadn't?
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:37.100]   Someone shared with you.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:43.100]   Romans one, verse 16 says this.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:45.260]   For I'm not ashamed of the gospel
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:48.340]   because it is the power of God
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.460]   that brings salvation to everyone who believes.
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:56.220]   First to the Jew and then to the Gentile.
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:01.980]   For I am not ashamed of the gospel
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.620]   because it is the power of God that brings salvation.
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.500]   Save their eternity.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.620]   They go from hell to heaven with God forever.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.900]   To everyone who believes upon this,
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.900]   first to the Jew and then to us and to your peers
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.340]   and to your family and to your neighbors.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.140]   They will be with God forever.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.260]   I just have a hunch there's going to be
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.140]   a little bit of gratitude waiting there for you.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.220]   Thank you so much for telling me
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:38.220]   that I could be with God, Jehovah, Creator,
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:42.660]   forever and ever in paradise.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.820]   That I didn't have to go there
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.380]   where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.980]   Whatever that is, it sounds awful.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.220]   I don't want to be there.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:57.220]   I heard one professor say it like this,
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.300]   that when he's sharing, he thinks of people
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.780]   like barrels of gunpowder.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.980]   Like he's lighting matches at barrels of gunpowder
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.980]   and some of the barrels are empty.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.900]   And so sometimes he lights a match and he throws it
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.900]   and nothing happens.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:16.540]   Lights a match, throws it, nothing happens.
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.620]   Sometimes he lights a match and he throws it.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.340]   (explosion)
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.820]   Salvation happens.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:26.820]   The light bulb turns on.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.020]   An eternal destiny is changed.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.100]   And he doesn't know which is which.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.380]   He doesn't know which of the barrels
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.100]   have gunpowder in them, which of them don't.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.820]   So he's just faithfully sharing the gospel.
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.780]   Because we are not in charge of the outcome.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.220]   God's in charge of the outcome.
[00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.540]   We're in charge of obedience.
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.860]   You cannot judge obedience by the outcome.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.660]   Obedience looks like sharing.
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.620]   That's the victory, that's what we celebrate.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.180]   The conversion, that's up to God.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.420]   You had nothing to do with that.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.740]   You shared faithfully.
[00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.820]   So when you share, we celebrate.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.580]   When someone is converted,
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.340]   the angels and the saints, they celebrate.
[00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.940]   You have no idea whose name is written in the book of life.
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.460]   So you share with everyone.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.380]   That makes it easy.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.220]   Who do I share with?
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.740]   Everyone.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.700]   But I'll be the weird guy.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.740]   Cool, man, you have the biggest house in heaven.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:10.580]   I don't know.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.420]   How do we share?
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.060]   Real quick, how do we share?
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.500]   I'm gonna keep it simple because sometimes
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.740]   I think the bridge illustration
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.460]   and all the illustrations just confuse things.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.300]   Three simple steps, you ready?
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.140]   Okay.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.300]   Engage.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.740]   First step, engage.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:34.060]   When you came in, you were given a top 10 list.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.860]   You write down 10 names of people you wanna engage with.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.020]   10 names that you're committed to praying for faithfully.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.900]   Put that in your Bible, hold on to it,
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.180]   look at it every day and just pray
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.980]   through those 10 names every day and watch God have fun.
[00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.260]   Watch God have fun with you.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.500]   Have fun answering your prayer.
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.100]   Pray faithfully.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.100]   Okay.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.940]   And so you engage.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.940]   What does engaging look like?
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.100]   Okay, engaging looks like not for the purpose
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.820]   of sharing the gospel, it just looks like loving people.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.100]   And I'm serious about this.
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.100]   Like if you're like in the back of your mind,
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.020]   like okay, I gotta transition this somehow.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.220]   Hey man, like what's up?
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:10.020]   Like hey, watch the Cowboys.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.380]   Man, did you know you're gonna go to hell
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:12.580]   unless you trust in Jesus?
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.100]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.100]   Don't go there, okay?
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.660]   What's up, bro?
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.460]   I was at Mudsmith yesterday, met Robert.
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.380]   What's up, Robert?
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.620]   Hey man, how long have you lived in Dallas?
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.940]   Eight years, where before Dallas?
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:31.340]   Frisco, oh that's still kinda Dallas, bro.
[00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.940]   And we're just talking now.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.780]   Where are you from?
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.620]   Oh man, I'm from Quero.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.620]   Oh yeah, of course you never heard of it.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.980]   I lived in Waco, then now Dallas.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.740]   Ah man, so how long have you worked here?
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.380]   We're just talking, man.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.460]   No big deal, just people, being people, just talking.
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.020]   Hey Robert, let me ask you a question.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.580]   You have a faith?
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.300]   I've asked that question literally hundreds of times.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.780]   I made sure that was a true statement,
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.500]   literally hundreds of times.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.900]   I've gotten the same answer every single time I've asked.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.740]   You ready?
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   Hey, do you have a faith?
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:05.780]   A what?
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.180]   Every time, no one has ever answered anything but a what?
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.780]   They're like, a face?
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.820]   Yes, I have a faith.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   No, a faith, a religion, a spirituality, a belief.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.940]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm Christian.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.540]   Yeah, no, no, I'm atheist.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.620]   No, no, man, I was raised in the church,
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:25.700]   I haven't been in a long time.
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.340]   Now we're talking about it, that transition.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.460]   How we got there.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.380]   It was easy, it wasn't hard, it wasn't difficult.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.700]   My palms aren't sweaty or anything.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.140]   Just like, hey man, I just wanna know your story.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.460]   And now I'm asking you about something
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.260]   that's important to me, do you have a faith?
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.140]   Can I tell you why I asked that and now,
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.840]   so the first step is engage, the second step is share.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.300]   Let me show you how I share.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.340]   Hey Robert, here's why I asked that, bro.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.940]   12 years ago I was in a bar,
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.300]   not far from where we're at right now,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.980]   just a block away.
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.580]   I was upstairs and someone invited me to church.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.700]   I had been to church my whole life,
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.740]   I had heard about Jesus,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:03.940]   but I went in the back of this church,
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:05.340]   I was hungover, I sat in the back row,
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.420]   I smelled like smoke from the club from the night before.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.140]   And I heard something for the first time,
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.100]   it was the reality that I didn't have to pay for my sins.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.020]   That God loved me so much that he sent his own son,
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.940]   Jesus Christ, to pay for my sins.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.040]   And we shouldn't know about Jesus, Robert.
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.060]   No one should know about Jesus,
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.860]   he was a carpenter from nowhere, Bethlehem.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.100]   You couldn't point to it on a map
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.860]   except for Jesus was from there.
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:29.820]   You ever heard of Nazareth?
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.960]   You shouldn't know where it is
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.720]   except for that's where Jesus lived.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.540]   You know when he was born?
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.740]   2014 years ago, in a day that we started counting from.
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.660]   Literally our calendar is based on his birth.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.820]   There's some significance about this guy, Jesus, Robert.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.740]   And when I realized that Jesus died for my sins
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.240]   and that God raised him from the dead,
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.960]   Robert, everything changed in my life.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.680]   I was a dude who loved to party, I loved sex,
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.200]   I loved having fun by the world's standards.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.560]   Usually resulted in a hangover of some sorts.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.840]   And God changed me, Robert.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.900]   And so now I'm just committed to sharing that story
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.400]   with anyone who will listen, and today that's you.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.940]   Share, engage, share, lastly, invite.
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:20.100]   Hey Robert, what they did up there,
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.000]   12 years ago when I was at the Beagle,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.640]   they invited me to church.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.240]   Robert, I wanna invite you to church, man.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.580]   My family would love to pick you up.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.680]   We would love for you to go with us.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.240]   In fact, tomorrow, Tuesday, seven o'clock,
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.900]   we're gonna be at this deal called The Porch.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.580]   It's the biggest party in town, Robert.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.860]   God's doing incredible work through young adults,
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.280]   20s and 30s just like you.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.160]   But I'd love for you to come.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.580]   I'd love for you to see what he's doing.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.960]   Would you come and hang out with me?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.800]   Engage, share, invite is the last one.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.920]   Invite, will you come with me?
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.340]   I'm showing you how God loves you.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.460]   I wanna take you to a group of people
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.900]   who would love to show you how God loves you.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.860]   Will you come with me?
[00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:13.000]   Be a light, engage, share, invite, it even rhymes.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.040]   And so in summary, you have a purpose to show Christ
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.940]   to a world that desperately needs him.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.900]   You have a place wherever God has put you
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.800]   and you have a people, those around you,
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.780]   your family, your neighbors, and your coworkers.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.360]   My team and I, we're waging war on your behalf
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   because I know that it's dark out there.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.100]   I will tell you, I've grown to a place
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.760]   where I enjoy sharing the gospel.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.400]   No one has ever cussed me out, no one's ever hit me.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.940]   I know our mind goes to the worst things.
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.680]   It's gonna be okay.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.360]   God loves you, he's sovereign.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.600]   You know, he's kinda asked you to do this.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.720]   But I know it's dark out there.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.360]   I know there is a lot of evil in the world.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.200]   And you are the soldiers, you are the warriors,
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.940]   you are the light that exists to push back the darkness.
[00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.460]   And so for just a second, if we can,
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.280]   please don't get up, please don't move around.
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.620]   If we just, for a second, can we just feel
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:14.920]   the weight of that darkness?
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:15.880]   I'm gonna bring down the lights.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.000]   If you would just hang tight for just a second,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.200]   it won't be long at all.
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.120]   If you're scared of the dark,
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.220]   hold someone's hand next to you.
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.740]   We're just going to bring down the lights.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.360]   And I want you to know that you're like,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.700]   JP, you don't understand my family, bro.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.640]   It's dark there.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.480]   You want me to share with my neighbors?
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.840]   Bro, I live in Deep Ellum, it's dark there.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.940]   You want me to share at work, JP?
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:46.960]   In my cube, you don't understand who I work with.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.960]   It's dark there, to which I say, God has a light.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.460]   He has put a light right where he needs it.
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:50:02.640]   And there you are, so that people can see.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.200]   And when people begin to see
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.440]   that there's something different about you,
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   the cool thing about that light is it spreads.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.320]   It spreads.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.200]   It spreads throughout Dallas.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.680]   It spreads throughout Fort Worth.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   And the culture that is the reality that God is,
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:33.360]   that God created, it is preserved.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.320]   And this is your mission, friends.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.620]   This is why you have breath in your lungs.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.800]   This is why your heart beats in your chest.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.820]   This, my friends, is your purpose.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.720]   That you would live for sharing this eternal truth,
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.480]   that others would come into the light,
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.640]   that the culture of Christianity
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.420]   and of Christ would be preserved.
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   It would not be lost in your generation, not on our time.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.560]   Can we bring the house lights back?
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.780]   (congregation applauding)
[00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.140]   Tonight, we're gonna do something fun in just a moment.
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.820]   So if you would not leave as we worship in this last song,
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.460]   I'm gonna invite the band, Robbie C,
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.580]   and his crew back up here.
[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.840]   And let me pray for us as we close out here.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.980]   But again, I'll be back in just one moment.
[00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.260]   Oh, Father, we realize that the essence
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:32.260]   of being a Christian is that we share in the same way
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.840]   that the essence of being a light is that we shine.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.180]   Oh, Father, would you help us shine?
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.220]   Father, we have received power from you,
[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:47.300]   from your Holy Spirit in us.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.500]   And so will you use that power for us?
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.580]   Would you, through us, help us press forward
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.460]   toward our purpose in the place
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.860]   that you have entrusted to us,
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.500]   with the people that you have entrusted to us?
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:08.220]   God, for your holy name, and for your fame,
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.260]   and for your honor, and for your glory, in Jesus' name.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.100]   Amen.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.260]   (silence)
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:19.420]   (silence)
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.580]   (silence)
[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:31.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
