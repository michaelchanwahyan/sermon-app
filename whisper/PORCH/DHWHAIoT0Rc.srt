 And I think he was onto something.

 Something in that song resonates with us.

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,240
 We know that to be true, but sometimes we just

84
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,600
 don't believe it, and we don't really live from that truth,

85
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,040
 live like we were dying.

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,760
 I remember not too long ago getting an unexpected phone

87
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,000
 call from a good friend of mine.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,600
 And he said that your roommate from college died.

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,560
 And I remember going to the funeral,

90
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,600
 and my teammates at the time all showed up, myself included,

91
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,720
 played college baseball.

92
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,240
 And I just remember these guys were at the funeral,

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,080
 and these guys that I'd watch over and over every weekend

94
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,440
 party, and I was part of it BC days before Christ.

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,960
 And I just remember watching just the funeral play out,

96
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,400
 and then we would get together after,

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,120
 and we were just talking about just spiritual things,

98
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
 like things that we had never talked about before.

99
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,760
 And I saw these men just contemplating life in a way

100
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,960
 that I never saw them contemplate life.

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
 And I start there tonight, because I'm not really

102
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,160
 telling you anything new.

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,560
 Like, you know that.

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,840
 But I think sometimes we just need the quick reminder of,

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,920
 hey, this life isn't all that there is.

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
 Like, we're going to die.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
 Like, 10 out of 10 people are going to die.

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
 Nobody's escaped that.

109
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,040
 And so tonight, we're pulling up on a familiar passage

110
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,320
 of scripture, if you've studied the scripture at all,

111
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,120
 which Solomon would say kind of in Ecclesiastes 7.

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,720
 He's going to say it's better to go to a funeral than a party.

113
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,600
 And so it's where we contemplate death.

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,720
 It's where we start to live with a new perspective,

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,760
 this perspective that the Bible would say is wisdom.

116
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,560
 It's where we start to think about what's

117
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,280
 really important in our lives and why we were created.

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,560
 James says it like this in James 4:14.

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,200
 He just says, "Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.

120
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,920
 What is your life?

121
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,680
 For you are a mist that appears for a little time

122
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,160
 and then vanishes."

123
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,160
 This past week, I was in the yard mowing.

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,360
 And I have a 2 and 1/2-year-old.

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,480
 And my 2 and 1/2-year-old, his name's Caleb.

126
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,000
 And we were just out.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You know, he's got the little Fisher-Price mower.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
 And he's mowing behind me.

129
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,080
 And we're just doing our thing, you know, father like son.

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,800
 And I'm doing some yard work.

131
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
 It's kind of what I do.

132
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,560
 I Sabbath with my hands because I always work with my mind.

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,600
 And so we're out there.

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,920
 And all of a sudden, out of the corner of my eye,

135
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,000
 I'm in the garage just getting something.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,520
 And he's on the edge of our driveway,

137
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,160
 practically in the street.

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,480
 And I remember seeing, as I looked--

139
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
 and I was about to call his name--

140
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 a car just came flying down the street.

141
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
 And I'm like, oh, no.

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,280
 I think my son's life has just flashed right before my eyes.

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,080
 And I know that car didn't see him because as he passes--

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,600
 he's on the edge of my driveway, practically in the street,

145
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,760
 from about-- from where I'm standing to where

146
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,960
 that screen is right there.

147
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
 It's just, you know, about 3 feet, 4 feet at the most.

148
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,520
 This car passes by.

149
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,720
 And it almost hits my son.

150
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,440
 And I share that with you tonight because in that moment,

151
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,560
 it just gave me a perspective that I didn't have.

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,080
 It allowed me to see that this life is but a vapor.

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,560
 It's here a little while, and it could be gone for my son.

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,720
 And so what do you do when you have that perspective shift?

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,960
 What do you do when wisdom begins to invade your heart?

156
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,200
 You look up the Texas Rangers schedule, and you say, hey,

157
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,280
 I'm going to take my son to a Texas Rangers game,

158
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,440
 even though he's 2 and 1/2.

159
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,560
 So we pull up Sunday afternoon.

160
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,640
 We go to Rally House.

161
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,120
 We get him a jersey.

162
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,360
 I get some, you know, Texas Rangers swag,

163
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,920
 and here we are at the game.

164
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,880
 And what is he holding in his hand?

165
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,520
 A foul ball that your boy caught.

166
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,640
 I'm like, that's crazy.

167
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,720
 Like, that's-- I'm 40 years old.

168
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,840
 And I've never caught a foul ball.

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,520
 And it's almost as if God was just saying, hey, life is short.

170
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,000
 Live it.

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,640
 And that analogy, it breaks down because it's not

172
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,920
 about Rally House and getting them the Corey Seeger jersey.

173
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,640
 What's up, Corey?

174
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,200
 Come on, baby.

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,040
 You can come to the porch any time you want.

176
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,520
 But it's not about that jersey.

177
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,280
 It's not about the game because all those things are temporal.

178
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,840
 But when Caleb almost got hit from the car, God gave me--

179
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,400
 He had me draw closer to him in my worry and my stress.

180
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,560
 And he started using that pain for his purpose,

181
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,160
 for me to draw closer to him.

182
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,400
 As I laid in bed that night just worried about my son,

183
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,480
 you know, concerned about what if he really did get hit.

184
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,600
 And God uses those moments in our life to draw us close to him.

185
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,480
 So how do you gain that kind of perspective in your life?

186
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,280
 Because let's be honest, in the room tonight,

187
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,000
 you're not going to get this-- most of us

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
 aren't going to go to the doctor and get a diagnosis

189
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,500
 that you have a few months to live

190
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,840
 or almost get hit by a car and get taken out.

191
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
 Like, that's not just-- that's not really

192
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,320
 how it works for most of-- maybe for some.

193
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,200
 But for most of us, it's subtle, right?

194
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,560
 It's things like this.

195
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,320
 For example, he seems like a good guy,

196
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,080
 seems like someone you want to take home to mama.

197
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
 But then you find out he's a creeper.

198
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
 You know what I mean?

199
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,720
 Is that nervous laughter?

200
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,240
 [LAUGHTER]

201
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,560
 It seems like the job of your dreams.

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,740
 You interviewed for it, and you got the job.

203
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,780
 And you're texting your friends, and you're like,

204
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,920
 I'm never going to have to work a day in my life.

205
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,400
 And you pull up in your power suit and your power tie,

206
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
 and you're ready to go.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,840
 Four months later, you're like, ah,

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,560
 it's not what I thought it was.

209
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,960
 I need to start looking for another job, right?

210
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,440
 It seemed like sex was a really good idea.

211
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,600
 I thought he was the one.

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,080
 I thought she was the one.

213
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,600
 And then you're left with brokenhearted perspective.

214
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,640
 And wisdom begins to invade your heart and your mind.

215
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
 And as Christians, I'll just start out here.

216
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,180
 Followers of Jesus Christ, we should be the wisest people

217
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,840
 in the room, because we have a direct line to the creator

218
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,280
 of the universe through the word of God, his Bible,

219
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,160
 that he's preserved for centuries.

220
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,960
 Like I always say, that God's word is God's voice.

221
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
 And so if you don't have a Bible tonight,

222
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,960
 let me just shameless plug, you can stop by the welcome desk

223
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,600
 on your way out.

224
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,000
 That's a free gift to you on us, because we want

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
 you to get into God's word.

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,900
 That's where we're going to be tonight.

227
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,600
 We're going to be in Ecclesiastes 7.

228
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,100
 If you have your Bibles, we're going

229
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,000
 to read from the wisest man who ever walked this earth,

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,160
 other than Jesus.

231
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,440
 Solomon has this unique encounter with God

232
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,520
 in 1 Kings 3 and 2 Chronicles 1.

233
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
 God shows up to Solomon, and he says,

234
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,440
 hey, you can have whatever you ask for.

235
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
 Can you imagine that?

236
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,480
 Can you imagine God saying, hey, you can have whatever you want.

237
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,400
 You can have that girl.

238
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,360
 You can have that job.

239
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,680
 You can have a billion dollars.

240
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
 You can have that house.

241
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
 You can have that car.

242
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,760
 Anything you want.

243
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,480
 So what does Solomon say?

244
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,600
 God, I want wisdom.

245
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
 True story.

246
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
 Historical account.

247
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,840
 And so he begins to run this experiment for his life

248
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,320
 where he gets all the wisdom.

249
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
 God just pours the wisdom out on him.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,280
 He begins to be one of the richest men ever.

251
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,160
 Look it up on Google.

252
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760
 Like $2.1 trillion was his net worth.

253
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,560
 And he begins to have these amazing parties.

254
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,080
 And he's got 1,000 wives and 300 concubines,

255
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,420
 like live-in girlfriends.

256
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,360
 The Playboy Mansion is at his house.

257
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,000
 And he runs this experiment.

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,640
 And he tries everything under the sun.

259
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,520
 We learned a few weeks ago that under the sun

260
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,760
 means apart from God.

261
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,400
 And he comes up short.

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
 And tonight, he's going to show us

263
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,560
 how to gain an eternal perspective, that we would

264
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
 loosen our grip on this life.

265
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,080
 And he would teach us that this world is not our home.

266
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,520
 Let's dive in.

267
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,800
 Ecclesiastes 7, verse 1.

268
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
 "A good name is better than precious ointment."

269
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,680
 Another translation says, "A good reputation

270
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,960
 is more valuable than costly perfume."

271
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,680
 I could literally spend the entire night

272
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,640
 talking about this one verse.

273
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,840
 Like it will preach, man.

274
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,560
 And so he's saying, hey, that your reputation is

275
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,680
 better than costly perfume.

276
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
 Perfume is something that, in that culture,

277
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,600
 that you would put on.

278
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
 It's still something that you put on, ladies, right?

279
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,520
 To make you more attractive.

280
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,120
 How?

281
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,000
 By the way you smell.

282
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,160
 And so don't miss this.

283
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,440
 You know what Solomon's saying?

284
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,240
 That something's better than your attraction.

285
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,160
 It's your character.

286
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,400
 It's your reputation.

287
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,560
 It's my first truth tonight.

288
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
 To gain an eternal perspective, we have to believe--

289
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
 you have to believe that character is better than

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,840
 charisma, if you're taking notes.

291
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,360
 Character is better than charisma.

292
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
 We have to believe this.

293
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
 If you don't leave with anything tonight,

294
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,000
 this is the one thing you should latch onto.

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,160
 That good character is better than charisma.

296
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,520
 Ladies, you would be a woman that

297
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,880
 would find a man that has really, really good character.

298
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,800
 Not just really good charisma and can woo you and tell you

299
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,440
 what you want to hear and whisper

300
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,880
 sweet nothings in your ear.

301
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,320
 Men, that you would look for a woman that

302
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,720
 has incredible character and the reputation

303
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,400
 follows her character.

304
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,440
 That when you ask the people around her who she really is,

305
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,520
 that they would tell you that she's a woman of character.

306
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,320
 There's a lot of good looking dudes out there,

307
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,600
 but they're ready to ruin your life.

308
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,240
 Some of them are right here tonight.

309
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,080
 They're in this room, and they carry Bibles.

310
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,360
 You think I'm playing?

311
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,160
 It's the phrase, they're wolves in sheep's clothing.

312
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,920
 They might even know some Bible verses.

313
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,560
 They do.

314
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
 Take it from him.

315
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,680
 They might even be in a community group,

316
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,280
 and they will wreck your life.

317
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
 They will ruin you.

318
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,080
 Same is true for women.

319
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,720
 Solomon reiterates this truth later on in this chapter

320
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,560
 in verse 26.

321
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,640
 I find more bitter than death.

322
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,920
 Solomon, what's more bitter than death, bro?

323
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,760
 The woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap,

324
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,400
 and whose hands are chains.

325
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,120
 The man who pleases God will escape her,

326
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,040
 but the sinner, she will ensnare.

327
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
 You know what he's saying there?

328
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,320
 He's describing a woman who is a snare

329
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,040
 and tries to trap guys with her body, with her smooth words,

330
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,160
 with manipulation.

331
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,720
 We talk about this a lot here, Proverbs 31, 30,

332
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,240
 and all the women roll their eyes, but it's true.

333
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
 It's not any less true.

334
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,440
 And I don't share this to shame you.

335
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,600
 I just share this as, hey, this is a great standard

336
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,640
 to run to.

337
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
 Not that you're going to be perfect,

338
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,600
 but it just says charm is deceitful and beauty is vain,

339
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,960
 but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

340
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,000
 That's what you're looking for, a woman of good character,

341
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,720
 a man who loves Jesus more than his sin, amen?

342
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,680
 And so, so many of us men,

343
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,880
 let me get off the women for a minute.

344
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,880
 We sit around and we use our thumbs to go after,

345
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,080
 you know, kingdoms that are fake and false realities

346
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,160
 and these video games, and we just sit there

347
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,120
 and act like we're accomplishing something.

348
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,600
 Nothing wrong with about video games.

349
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
 I'm not here to have a tiff with video games,

350
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,760
 but so many of us, we never engage

351
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,160
 in the real battle at hand,

352
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
 that there's heaven and hell, that there's evil and good,

353
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,680
 that there's a conquering King and Jesus

354
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,920
 who came on a rescue mission,

355
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,120
 died on the cross for your sin,

356
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,320
 rose again on the third day to defeat sin and death.

357
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,440
 And some of you spend more time investing

358
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,720
 in false realities on a video game

359
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,760
 than you do investing in that kingdom

360
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,400
 that's gonna last forever and ever and ever and ever.

361
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,900
 (congregation applauding)

362
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,840
 And so tonight, like, what are you living for?

363
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,640
 What are you after?

364
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,200
 Here's my word of caution with online dating.

365
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,400
 It's not a moral issue, it's not right or wrong,

366
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,860
 but just be careful.

367
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,840
 Never trust a profile because profiles lie.

368
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,600
 You hear that all the time up here,

369
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,560
 but we're out for your good.

370
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,220
 Trust their character, not their charisma.

371
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,000
 Don't trust their smooth words.

372
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
 Watch and observe.

373
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,080
 Dating is for observation and edification

374
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,000
 that you would observe their life over a period of time.

375
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,100
 What should you observe?

376
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,360
 Here's some things to observe.

377
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,520
 Do they keep commitments even when it hurts?

378
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,400
 Do they cut corners at work when no one's looking?

379
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,300
 Do they rationalize sin and make excuses for it?

380
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,940
 Do they spend their 20s and 30s serving others

381
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,620
 so that they can come to know Jesus?

382
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,260
 Do they use their time to know their Bible

383
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,480
 and memorize scripture?

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,260
 Is anyone investing in their life?

385
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,980
 If no one is investing in their life,

386
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,980
 if they don't have a mentor or somebody to disciple them,

387
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,220
 do not date them, point blank.

388
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,600
 That is a red flag if I've ever seen one.

389
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,540
 Like if no one is investing in their life,

390
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,260
 if they're not investing in other people's lives,

391
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
 it's a two-way street.

392
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,900
 You have someone discipling you

393
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,720
 and you pour that out to other people

394
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,620
 who need to be mentored and discipled.

395
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,220
 Are they secure with who they are in Christ?

396
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,900
 Are they constantly looking for the world to affirm them?

397
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,420
 What are their hearts feeding on?

398
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,740
 The heart wants what the heart wants.

399
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,580
 No, that's not true.

400
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,780
 The heart wants what you feed it.

401
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,940
 What are they feeding their heart?

402
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,780
 And so that is how you test, is this woman,

403
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,180
 is this man a man of character?

404
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,460
 Are they just a man of charisma?

405
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,500
 Do they have woo?

406
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,440
 But it falls short when the rubber meets the road.

407
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,540
 God says he wants us to have a good name,

408
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,340
 meaning he wants us to become more,

409
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,220
 become men and women of nobility and righteousness.

410
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,820
 He doesn't want to just bless us, he wants to change us.

411
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,380
 Like T.A. talked about last week,

412
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,340
 he wants us to grow up in Christ

413
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,520
 so that we reflect his image.

414
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,860
 We were created in his image.

415
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,820
 In the image of Christ, he created us, male and female.

416
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,340
 Reflect his image wherever you go.

417
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,580
 How does God bring about this change?

418
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,980
 How does he build character and produce a reputation

419
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,900
 worth following?

420
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,580
 Through pain and suffering.

421
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,960
 What did he just say?

422
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,580
 Through pain and suffering.

423
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,420
 Here we go.

424
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,260
 Second part of verse one, we just made it through one,

425
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,140
 not even, but we're moving.

426
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,860
 He says this, "And the day of death," what's better?

427
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,500
 "The day of death than the day of birth."

428
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,340
 What does he mean?

429
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,420
 It's like he's talking in code tonight.

430
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,340
 Like we need to take a deep dive

431
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,260
 and discover the truth of scripture.

432
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,580
 He's saying, hey, the day of birth and the following days

433
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,740
 is when you discover your character and your reputation,

434
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,620
 but the day you die is when your character

435
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,000
 and your reputation are fully revealed in totality.

436
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,820
 Like, you know what you, you know, going to a funeral

437
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,560
 and there's people that usually get up on stage, right?

438
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,700
 Or they get up in front of that funeral

439
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,180
 and they begin to say nice things.

440
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,400
 And, you know, there's people that nod

441
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,380
 when they say nice things.

442
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,540
 And then when people say nice things,

443
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,680
 there's people that know that they're lying.

444
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,140
 You've been there.

445
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,980
 I've been there at those funerals.

446
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,040
 And you're like, man, what they're portraying

447
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,620
 is not how that person really lived their life.

448
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,500
 What do you want to be tonight?

449
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,880
 What are you pursuing?

450
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,000
 He goes on and says in verse two,

451
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,280
 it is better to go to the house of mourning

452
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,520
 than to go to the house of feasting.

453
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,360
 Know what he's saying there?

454
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,880
 It's better to go to funerals than parties.

455
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,580
 For this is the end of all mankind.

456
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,120
 Everyone is going to die, he says.

457
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,160
 And the living will lay it to heart.

458
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,400
 Sorrow is better than laughter for by sadness of face,

459
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
 the heart is made glad.

460
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,840
 For sadness is pain, he's saying,

461
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,640
 has a refining influence on our life.

462
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,220
 He goes on and says the heart of the wise

463
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,800
 is in the house of mourning,

464
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,260
 but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

465
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,120
 In other words, a wise person thinks a lot about death

466
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,440
 while fools only think about having a good time.

467
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,900
 Sometimes a funeral is better than a party, he says.

468
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,740
 Why?

469
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,020
 Because pain makes you real.

470
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,940
 Pain gets your thinking straight.

471
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,940
 Pain allows you to see that you weren't made for this world.

472
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,100
 You were made for another world.

473
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,080
 Pain refines you, it shows you what's important.

474
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,400
 It's an important part of the process.

475
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,240
 Why?

476
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,640
 Because good times can fool you,

477
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,380
 which is my second spiritual truth tonight.

478
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,840
 To gain an eternal perspective,

479
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,500
 we have to believe that good times can fool you.

480
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,480
 I was talking to a friend of mine

481
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,360
 who is the chaplain for the Dallas Mavericks,

482
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,560
 and he was doing a chapel service for the Indiana Pacers.

483
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,200
 And he was just sharing about God

484
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,940
 and through the person of Jesus Christ and eternity.

485
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,800
 And someone on the Indiana Pacers just blurted out,

486
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,760
 "Bro, what does this have to do with me?"

487
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,980
 Like just point blank.

488
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,800
 And he just said, "Hey, you gotta be quick on your feet

489
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
 "'cause you never know how people

490
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,700
 "are gonna respond in that room."

491
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,940
 And he looked at me and just said,

492
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,940
 "Hey bro, you have everything the world offers.

493
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,420
 "You have fame, you have status, you have money,

494
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,760
 "you have cars, you have houses, you have women.

495
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,000
 "You have everything the world offers.

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,040
 "Everything is at your fingertips.

497
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,860
 "But there's still something.

498
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,760
 "Everybody has something.

499
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,580
 "Everyone's not perfect.

500
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,220
 "Everyone's going to die.

501
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,120
 "Everyone's gonna stand before their creator

502
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,440
 "and they're gonna have to give an account

503
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,680
 "for that thing in their life.

504
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
 "What's your thing, bro?"

505
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
 You know what he was saying?

506
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,160
 He literally was saying good times can fool you.

507
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,920
 Good times can keep you from trusting in God.

508
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,280
 Because everything is going well for you.

509
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,160
 You don't need God.

510
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,720
 You're doing pretty good on your own.

511
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,960
 Plenty of people in America face this reality

512
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,860
 that everything's good.

513
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,880
 And when it's not, they numb themself with a drink

514
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,480
 or a drug so they don't have to deal

515
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,720
 with the reality of pain.

516
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,000
 To which this Indiana pacer just said,

517
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,580
 "My thing is women.

518
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,640
 "Thank you."

519
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,760
 And they just engaged in this incredible dialogue

520
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,960
 in the middle of chapel.

521
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,120
 And it was just a beautiful moment

522
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,240
 where he's ministering to this guy

523
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,400
 that has everything at his fingertips.

524
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
 But he knows he has that thing.

525
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
 He knows that that's not right.

526
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,920
 He knows that doesn't end well for him.

527
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,000
 Proverbs 14, 12 says, "There's a way that seems right

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,520
 "to man, but that way ends in death."

529
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,840
 What's your thing tonight?

530
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,600
 That if you go throughout your life

531
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,240
 and you leave that thing unchecked,

532
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,800
 it's not gonna go well for you.

533
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,480
 See, I can go and preach at a bar,

534
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,460
 but no one's gonna listen to me

535
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,320
 because they're laughing and they're having a good time.

536
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,160
 I can go preach at a funeral and I have a captive audience.

537
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,340
 People are focused on the things of eternity.

538
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,480
 They're open to the reality of God.

539
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,440
 They're open to the reality of the gospel,

540
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,280
 the life, the death, the burial,

541
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,120
 and the resurrection of Jesus.

542
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,320
 Every funeral is a reminder that one day you're gonna die,

543
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
 that each of us have an expiration date

544
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,960
 and only God knows when that is.

545
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,860
 The wise person also recognizes the benefits of pain.

546
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,700
 It humbles you.

547
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,200
 It gives you a sobering reality about life.

548
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,920
 It says, "When a person's face is sad,

549
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,440
 "the heart may be happy."

550
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,260
 Why?

551
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:55,260
 Because that pain has taught them some things about life,

552
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,920
 that there's more that meets the eye,

553
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,240
 that pain is a reality for all of us

554
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,240
 because we live in a broken world, cursed by sin.

555
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,740
 And so all suffering is a result of the fall, sin.

556
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,960
 Pain is the best teacher we have outside of God himself.

557
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,160
 C.S. Lewis said it like this,

558
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,020
 "Pain is God's megaphone for a deaf world."

559
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,860
 Why?

560
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,200
 Because it wakes us up from our sleeping slumber.

561
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,320
 The mentality that the Christian life

562
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,160
 is all about health, wealth, and prosperity,

563
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,700
 and God's gonna bless you,

564
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,440
 and it's not wrong to pray for healing.

565
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,680
 It's not wrong to pray for blessing.

566
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,300
 It's just wrong to believe that's always God's best for you.

567
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,480
 And so tonight, where are you at?

568
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,380
 I know that there's young adults in this room

569
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,700
 and all across the rooms that are occupied

570
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,800
 through the Porch Live locations

571
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,420
 and people listening online at a later date

572
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,620
 that are dealing with some really hard things in their life,

573
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,980
 painful things.

574
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,640
 And God wants to use that to refine you,

575
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,180
 to cause you to depend on him,

576
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,980
 to strip you of the things that you think

577
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,940
 are gonna give you life

578
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,040
 and give you satisfaction and fulfillment.

579
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,460
 I was thinking earlier today

580
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,660
 just about some of the pains in my own life.

581
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,580
 The first real pain I experienced

582
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,780
 was when I found out my parents

583
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,020
 were getting a divorce at a young age.

584
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,160
 When I didn't make the basketball team in high school,

585
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,860
 white men can't jump, that's true.

586
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,100
 (congregation laughing)

587
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,460
 Well, maybe some of you can.

588
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,600
 When my high school crush broke up with me,

589
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,760
 now you can laugh, it's cool, it's beyond me.

590
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,820
 It's behind me, I should say.

591
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,500
 When I found out that my roommate from college passed away.

592
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 When I was 30 and still not married.

593
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,900
 When my sister-in-law got a life-threatening

594
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,940
 colon cancer diagnosis.

595
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,780
 When I found out that our first child

596
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,420
 might have a genetic disorder.

597
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,560
 When my son Caleb almost got hit by a car.

598
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,620
 And I get it, like we can compare lists

599
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,900
 and I don't think that's always helpful

600
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,660
 because there's some things going on in this room

601
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,100
 that like your list pales.

602
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,460
 Or my list pales in comparison to your list.

603
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,300
 And that's not the point of this.

604
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,580
 The point of this is just you saying,

605
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,940
 "Hey, there's pain.

606
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,340
 "There's pain in your life, there's pain in my life."

607
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,260
 And God wants to use that pain

608
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,220
 to cause a deeper dependency on him.

609
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,580
 Pain is God's megaphone to a deaf world.

610
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,860
 Could it be that the pain you have experienced

611
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,040
 and are experiencing is there for your good in God's glory?

612
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,540
 Last time I stood up on this stage,

613
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,060
 I quoted a verse in Romans 8, 28.

614
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,860
 It just says, "God causes all things, good or bad,

615
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,620
 "to work together for the good of those who love him

616
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,520
 "and called according to his purpose."

617
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,500
 And I believe that God is gonna cause

618
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,220
 whatever's going on in your life,

619
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,740
 whatever has happened to you,

620
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,700
 for your good and for his glory.

621
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,300
 And for people to look at your pain

622
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,060
 and watch you run to Christ,

623
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,320
 not to things of the world.

624
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,540
 And they're gonna take notice

625
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,100
 and they're gonna begin to ask questions

626
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,540
 and they're gonna begin to be curious about your God.

627
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,580
 I believe that's true for some of you in this room.

628
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,980
 I pray that's true for some of you in this room.

629
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,340
 Verse four.

630
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,540
 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning.

631
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,340
 He just keeps punching this.

632
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,140
 He keeps throwing this out

633
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,400
 as if we didn't get it the first three verses.

634
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,320
 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,

635
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,820
 but the heart of the fools is in the house of mirth.

636
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,380
 In other words, a wise person thinks a lot about death

637
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,940
 while a fool only thinks about having a good time.

638
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,920
 To gain perspective, you have to believe it's good.

639
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,580
 To gain an eternal perspective,

640
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,580
 you have to believe that God is using your good times

641
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,020
 and your bad times to refine you

642
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,320
 into the man and the woman he wants you to be.

643
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,880
 The mind of the fool is wasting their years

644
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,020
 at some bar looking for a temporary high.

645
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,360
 The mind of a fool is in the house of feasting,

646
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,180
 in the house of pleasure, the next party, the next drink,

647
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,500
 the next purchase, the next toy they're gonna buy,

648
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,140
 the next restaurant they're gonna go to,

649
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,020
 the next vacation they're gonna take,

650
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,540
 the next person they're gonna date,

651
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,580
 the next whatever it is, fill in the blank.

652
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,700
 And then your life is over and you stand before your creator

653
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,900
 who gave his life for you on the cross.

654
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,300
 Verse five, it is better for a man to hear the rebuke

655
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,600
 of the wise than to hear the song of fools.

656
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,700
 Proverbs 27, six just couples this verse really, really well.

657
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,000
 It just says this, wounds from a friend can be trusted,

658
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,780
 but an enemy multiplies kisses.

659
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,140
 To gain an eternal perspective,

660
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,500
 you have to believe point number three,

661
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,640
 wounds from a friend can be trusted.

662
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,020
 The mind of a fool only hangs out with people

663
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,060
 who will tell them what they wanna hear

664
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,580
 versus tell them what they need to hear.

665
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,220
 We talk a lot about community here at The Porch

666
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,220
 because The Porch is Watermark Community's

667
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,660
 young adult ministry.

668
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,860
 Community is in our middle name.

669
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,700
 We believe that the men and women

670
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,380
 that you hang out with is important.

671
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,560
 Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.

672
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,120
 This idea that, hey, who are your people?

673
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,560
 Who do you run to?

674
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,680
 Have you ever had someone you really respect

675
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,480
 say, hey, we need to talk.

676
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,760
 It's that, hey, we need to talk.

677
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,080
 And like on the other end, you're like,

678
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,640
 oh dear, what did I do?

679
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,880
 Like what happened?

680
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,400
 And they pull up a seat at the table

681
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,480
 and they begin to look at you

682
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,120
 kind of like those piercing eyes.

683
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
 And it's really someone you respect.

684
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,260
 Maybe 80% of the room, you probably like,

685
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,900
 yeah, I've had this happen to me

686
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,180
 and it didn't go well, bro.

687
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,780
 Okay, well, let's talk about that, we will.

688
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,220
 But for the 20% of us, right,

689
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,460
 who maybe has had that happen in a way

690
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,060
 where that person began to point some things out,

691
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,180
 we call them blind spots in our life

692
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,420
 that we can't see, but maybe they can.

693
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,740
 And they're things that are inconsistent

694
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,580
 with the character of Christ.

695
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,560
 And so they begin to share some things

696
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,000
 about our life that just aren't adding up

697
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,760
 to what we say we believe through our actions.

698
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,160
 They just don't line up.

699
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,780
 Those things aren't congruent.

700
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,980
 I've had it happen to me.

701
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,160
 Actually, I have it happen to me

702
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,360
 almost every Friday morning

703
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,520
 when I get together with my guys at 6 a.m.

704
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,840
 You know what happens sometimes in those moments?

705
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,760
 I'm like, can we just go have a drink?

706
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,560
 Can we just go have a drink,

707
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,260
 just share a beer together and not worry about this?

708
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,980
 Can we just go to North Park Mall

709
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,900
 and buy a new pair of clothes?

710
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,620
 Like, can we just plan the next vacation?

711
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,940
 Can we just go eat some good food, bro?

712
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,900
 I don't really care for you to look at my life

713
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,420
 and start pointing things out

714
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,620
 that are inconsistent to the character of Christ

715
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,560
 and how I talk to my wife at times

716
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,660
 and how I'm sharp-tongued with my kids

717
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,940
 and the lust that I have in my heart.

718
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,060
 And it doesn't feel good.

719
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,600
 And I wanna hit the easy button.

720
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,780
 I wanna hit reject.

721
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,220
 But I know that Proverbs 27, six is so true.

722
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,780
 That wounds from a friend can be trusted,

723
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,320
 but an enemy multiplies kisses.

724
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,760
 And I know that if I just go to people

725
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,080
 that just wanna suppress the areas of my life

726
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,740
 that really aren't consistent with the character of Christ,

727
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,960
 I know that I will never be God's man.

728
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,080
 And so I just ask,

729
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,600
 like, where are you today with your community?

730
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,640
 What does that look like for you?

731
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,880
 And if you don't have it,

732
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,400
 then I'm pleading with you through the text,

733
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,300
 through the word of God, that you would find that.

734
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,440
 Because sometimes instead of receiving a good rebuke,

735
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,100
 we run to the songs of fools instead.

736
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,960
 We're like, Bruno Mars, will you teach me?

737
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,880
 He's been locked out of heaven, right?

738
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,640
 Why are we gonna listen to him?

739
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,560
 We're like, what about T Swift?

740
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,800
 She's still got bad blood

741
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,440
 because band-aids don't fix bullet wounds.

742
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,740
 You know, like, what are we doing?

743
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,520
 And it's like Amy Winehouse,

744
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,380
 like she says, don't go to rehab,

745
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,560
 which is pretty sobering because she didn't go to rehab

746
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,820
 and she's not here today.

747
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:53,040
 And that's not so funny because it's true.

748
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,740
 And so we run to these,

749
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:59,360
 the song of fools it says at the end of verse five.

750
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,220
 And we wonder why our life is still on the crazy train.

751
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,940
 And we're not getting off of it.

752
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,320
 And we keep doing the same things over and over,

753
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,760
 expecting a different result.

754
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,440
 And culture would just say,

755
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,120
 that's the definition of insanity.

756
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,640
 And so tonight you have a chance.

757
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,440
 Every single week, there's a team of people down front.

758
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,260
 There's next steps in the loft

759
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,160
 that you can go and say, hey, I just,

760
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,720
 I'm tired of suppressing my sin.

761
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,200
 I'm tired of not having the right people in my life.

762
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,360
 The men that I'm running with

763
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,840
 are really not pointing me to Christ.

764
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,240
 The women, they just, you know,

765
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,120
 want to talk about things that don't really matter

766
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,000
 for all of eternity.

767
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,680
 And I know I'm not really being God's woman

768
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,480
 and God's calling me to step up.

769
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,120
 God's calling me to grow up.

770
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,920
 God's calling me to run to people who are going to wound me

771
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,960
 and be faithful in that.

772
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,260
 And listen, I know there's people in this room

773
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,180
 that have tried community.

774
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,620
 And listen, people have, you've confessed some things

775
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,580
 and they've mismanaged information about you.

776
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,940
 And I am sorry.

777
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,140
 That is not the church.

778
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,160
 That is not from God.

779
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:14,080
 Like this should be the safest place on the planet

780
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,760
 to be real and to confess sin to.

781
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,460
 Amen?

782
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,160
 If this isn't the safest place,

783
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,280
 then where are we going to go?

784
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,040
 And if that's been your experience, I'm sorry.

785
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,880
 And I want to talk to you.

786
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,680
 We want to talk to you and we want to help you find

787
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,040
 the people in your life that you can do that with.

788
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,000
 Verse six, "For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,

789
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,480
 so is the laughter of the fools.

790
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,840
 This also is vanity."

791
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,760
 This is just what he's saying.

792
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,520
 "Like thorns, they burn fast and they make a loud noise.

793
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,520
 At this time, you would cook your food under kindling

794
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,840
 and there would be thorns and they would burn fast

795
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,060
 and they would make a noise."

796
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,980
 And he's just saying, this is what fools do.

797
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,960
 They just laugh off their sin.

798
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,360
 They're just like, "Ha ha ha, you know,

799
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,660
 I don't really don't have a drinking problem.

800
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,840
 Ah, you know, listen, man, it's just a little bit of porn.

801
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,320
 It's not really going to matter."

802
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,440
 All the while, you know that that two-dimensional image

803
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,240
 that you keep running back to is only feeding variety

804
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,520
 in your life so you never love one person alone.

805
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,320
 And the repeater cheater in you is just going to come out.

806
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,120
 And listen, anytime you have a lustful desire,

807
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,320
 you're just telling the person you're dating,

808
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,480
 "Hey, I'm an adulterer.

809
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,560
 I'm just waving my hands right now."

810
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,580
 Because an adulterer is someone who does something

811
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,640
 with someone else who is not their spouse.

812
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,060
 And you're just waving your hands up in the air saying,

813
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,960
 "Hey, I'm an adulterer.

814
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,640
 I'm just letting you know right now that if we get married

815
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,200
 and I have a lustful thought, I have a lustful desire,

816
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
 I'm going to do the same thing that I trained myself to do

817
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,720
 when I was single and when I was dating you."

818
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,840
 That's what you're telling them.

819
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,860
 And you keep saying, "Hey, this is going to be the last time."

820
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,380
 And there's just broken promises after broken promise

821
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,480
 that you make to your special someone that you're dating.

822
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,320
 And you know what?

823
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,360
 You're still living in the same crap.

824
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,240
 There, I said it.

825
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,740
 (audience applauding)

826
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,660
 And listen, I'm not here to shame you.

827
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,960
 I was a porn addict for a decade of my life.

828
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,880
 But at some point you draw the line in the sand,

829
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,080
 you nail a stake in the ground,

830
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,780
 and you said enough is enough.

831
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,600
 I'm done.

832
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,520
 I'm done being that guy.

833
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,240
 I'm done being that girl.

834
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,160
 And I'm going to run to Christ and his people.

835
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,880
 And right there, I'm going to find a safe place

836
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
 to be God's man and to be God's woman.

837
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,040
 And so you don't just laugh it off.

838
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,240
 It's not just no big deal.

839
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,600
 It's not, it's going to be fine.

840
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,520
 No, it's not going to be fine.

841
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,840
 Your life is a train wreck.

842
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,040
 Get off the crazy train.

843
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,260
 Who are your friends who will faithfully wound you

844
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,720
 and say, "It's not fine.

845
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,160
 "Enough is enough."

846
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,840
 Verse seven, "Surely oppression drives the wise

847
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,440
 "into madness and a bribe corrupts the heart."

848
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,480
 It just says, "Exhorting people for power and wealth

849
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,980
 "turns wise people into fools."

850
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,560
 The mind of a fool just says, "Hey, what's in it for me?

851
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
 "It's all about what's in it for me.

852
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,000
 "It's hey, if you can do for me what I want,

853
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
 "then I'll be your friend."

854
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,200
 Where are your friends that just love you for who you are

855
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,120
 and not what you can do for them?

856
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,160
 Like they love you enough, not just to,

857
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,000
 if there's sin in your life, they're going to call it out,

858
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,780
 but they're going to say, "Hey, I'm going to walk with you

859
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,780
 "through this pain, this sin, this hardship.

860
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,160
 "And I'm not going to bail when everyone else around me

861
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,760
 "says it's okay."

862
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,440
 Just not, "I'm going to stick with you.

863
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,660
 "I'm going to walk with you.

864
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,480
 "And if you keep falling, I'm going to help,

865
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,400
 "I'm going to help pick you back up."

866
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,020
 Where are your friends?

867
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,180
 Where are those people?

868
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,420
 Verse eight, "Better is the end of a thing

869
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,820
 "than its beginning.

870
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,880
 "And the patient in spirit is better

871
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,580
 "than the proud in spirit.

872
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,360
 "Be not quick in your spirit to become angry,

873
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,820
 "for anger lodges in the heart of fools.

874
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,780
 "Say not, 'Why were the former days better than these?'

875
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,900
 "For it is not from wisdom that you ask this."

876
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,320
 It just says, this is what he's saying.

877
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,280
 Finishing is better than starting.

878
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,120
 Patience is better than pride.

879
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,840
 Controlling your temper for anger labels you a fool.

880
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,320
 It's saying in the context of maybe life

881
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,880
 not working out the way you want it,

882
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,600
 don't mock God, don't flip God off.

883
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,740
 God's doing something in the pain.

884
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,280
 Don't get angry at God, get angry at sin.

885
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,280
 Get angry that sin is the result of suffering.

886
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,600
 And the fact that every time we suffer,

887
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,080
 you can remember that this world is not our home.

888
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,900
 It's saying, "Hey, this is not wise.

889
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,700
 "God, why aren't you working in my life like you did before?

890
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,420
 "Why am I struggling financially?

891
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,460
 "What with my job?

892
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,240
 "Why did that person die?

893
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,340
 "Or why does that person have to go through cancer?

894
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,960
 "Why am I still not married?"

895
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,360
 To gain perspective, you have to live with the end in mind,

896
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,000
 which is my last spiritual truth.

897
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,420
 Live with the end in mind.

898
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,680
 I'm discipling a guy named Tanner,

899
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,680
 and I'm excited because he just got engaged.

900
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,360
 And it's been a long time coming.

901
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,160
 I've been walking with him for some time,

902
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,680
 and I'm about to do his wedding in October.

903
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,200
 And I love this brother, like he's my boy.

904
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,840
 And we get to meet every other week,

905
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,140
 and the weeks that we don't meet, we just do life together.

906
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,440
 And I texted him this,

907
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,920
 just in light of his wedding coming up.

908
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,260
 And I just said, "Hey, bro, what is louder?

909
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,100
 "The beginning of something or the end of it?

910
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,540
 "The beginning always makes more noise.

911
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,920
 "Weddings are big, loud, and fun.

912
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,960
 "I will love you faithfully until the end of your life

913
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
 "as the music is playing.

914
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,100
 "You and Lauren are gonna make a beautiful couple,

915
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,600
 "but let's check back in 30 years

916
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,960
 "after y'all have hurt each other and cried,

917
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,720
 "raised some kids, Lord willing,

918
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,920
 "and each gained about 40 pounds.

919
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,880
 "Hopefully not, right?

920
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,920
 "But life gets lifey, bro."

921
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
 Emojis.

922
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,180
 (audience laughing)

923
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,280
 I should just put the text on the screen.

924
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,720
 I went on and I just said,

925
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,540
 "Hey, I guarantee the end won't be as loud as the beginning,

926
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,700
 "but it's sure a lot more important.

927
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,260
 "The end of the matter is more important than the beginning

928
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,080
 "because the beginning is all talk.

929
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,900
 "I love weddings and I can't wait to officiate y'alls.

930
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,960
 "But what's even better is when you see an older couple

931
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,380
 "in public holding hands, sitting close,

932
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,000
 "opening the door for his bride, kissing, why?

933
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,120
 "Because they're being faithful to the end."

934
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,200
 There isn't a lot of fluff, it's just glorious.

935
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,040
 The beginning is just words.

936
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,380
 Vows are good, but they're just good intentions

937
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,860
 of what you think you will do.

938
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,040
 It's a whole lot better to actually make it to the end.

939
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
 Praying that you too will continue

940
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,400
 to fall more in love with Jesus so you make it to the end.

941
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,160
 Can't wait to celebrate y'all on your wedding,

942
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,060
 but even more so 30 years from now.

943
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,760
 Commitment.

944
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,900
 That's what he's saying here.

945
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,800
 How are you gonna be a man or woman of commitment?

946
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,060
 You live with the end in mind.

947
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,160
 How do you do that?

948
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,640
 You need to start with where you hope to end up.

949
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,640
 All commitments start with the end in mind.

950
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,120
 Know where you are and know where you wanna be

951
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,800
 and get your community together

952
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,260
 and let them help you game plan for where you wanna go.

953
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,600
 For where you wanna go.

954
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,460
 It's your path, not your promises,

955
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,260
 that take you to the place that you end up, you know that?

956
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,680
 Live with the end in mind.

957
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,840
 I'll close with this.

958
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,460
 From time to time, I like going to cemeteries.

959
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,140
 And yesterday morning, I just, I started the week off

960
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,960
 and I grabbed another guy in my discipleship group

961
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,180
 and we went out to a cemetery close to my house.

962
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,820
 I get it, it's morbid because it is, okay?

963
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,840
 But what I love about going to cemeteries

964
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,860
 is it just begins to refine your perspective.

965
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,840
 I mean, even me, I mean, I get it.

966
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,880
 I'm not, I don't want you to prop me up

967
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,740
 to an unhealthy place.

968
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,500
 Like, man, I'm fleshly, bro.

969
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,700
 Like there's things in me that, man, are just not of God.

970
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,580
 And I need God to refine those.

971
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,260
 And there's times when I just wanna live

972
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,300
 with a temporal perspective and not an eternal one.

973
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,140
 And so I get out of my car

974
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,140
 and the first grave that I walk up to had this on it.

975
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:51,420
 That's my last name, Jones.

976
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
 Go to the next pic.

977
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:00,220
 Okay, don't go to the next pic.

978
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,020
 But, oh, there it is.

979
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,700
 And there's a cross right behind it.

980
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,780
 And it was as if God was saying, "Hey, Josiah."

981
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,100
 And I get, man, I think about the brevity of life

982
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,860
 all the time, I'm a pastor.

983
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,620
 But even in that moment, I needed to be quickened

984
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,900
 to the reality that this place is not my home.

985
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,500
 And God just began to sober me up

986
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,900
 and he began to show me things in my life.

987
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,220
 You might ask, "Well, what does that mean, sober you up?"

988
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,980
 Frustration and anger when things didn't go my way

989
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,940
 last week.

990
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,020
 Quick-tempered with my wife to respond in a way

991
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,120
 that isn't helpful and isn't loving.

992
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,220
 Sharp tongue with my kids.

993
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,040
 Wishing I made more money.

994
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,260
 People would recognize me more,

995
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,820
 that I would have more fame and more status.

996
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:51,100
 And it was just sickening things that God began to reveal

997
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,340
 as I'm walking from grave site to grave site,

998
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,700
 tombstone to tombstone.

999
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,620
 And I'm looking at the dates and I'm looking at

1000
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,140
 what people say about these people's lives.

1001
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,260
 And there's people that live for a day

1002
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,660
 and live for 100 plus years.

1003
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,460
 But even in 100 plus years is a vapor.

1004
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,080
 It's here a little while and then it's gone.

1005
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,140
 And what it began to do is sober me up to the reality

1006
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,440
 that, "Man, what do I want my life to be about?"

1007
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,500
 And I began just to write things out in my notebook

1008
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,020
 and just say, "God, thank you for revealing this to me.

1009
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,920
 "I needed this.

1010
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,060
 "Shared this with my community.

1011
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,300
 "Went home and talked to my wife, Kathy, that night

1012
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,320
 "and just said, 'Hey, will you forgive me

1013
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,480
 "'for the way that I've come across this past week

1014
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,380
 "'with my anger and my words and my tone?

1015
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,420
 "'Got my kids in the living room

1016
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,120
 "'and sat 'em on the couch, my six, my four

1017
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,440
 "'and my two and a half year old.'

1018
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,280
 "And I just said, 'Hey, you've seen Daddy not at his best.

1019
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,420
 "'Will you forgive me?'"

1020
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,640
 That's what it does.

1021
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,020
 When you live with the end in mind,

1022
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,700
 when you don't just go through life

1023
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,960
 thinking that this life is all that there is.

1024
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,400
 Solomon's just saying in closing,

1025
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,260
 "Live with the end in mind.

1026
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,420
 "Embrace the pain we experience.

1027
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,700
 "It's gonna grow wisdom in us."

1028
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,940
 What if your character is shaped by,

1029
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,460
 God, every time pain enters your life,

1030
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,780
 then you're a guaranteed success

1031
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,220
 that you're gonna look more like him.

1032
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,080
 That's what God's after.

1033
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,160
 God loves you and sometimes has to use pain

1034
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,660
 in showing you that death is not far off

1035
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,140
 to get your attention,

1036
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,100
 to let you know that he's God and we're not,

1037
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,820
 to let you know that there's something outside of the sun,

1038
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,280
 S-U-N, there's the sun, S-O-N,

1039
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,040
 that came on a rescue mission for you and me

1040
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,620
 over 2,000 years ago.

1041
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,960
 He didn't see fit to leave us in our sin.

1042
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,660
 So there's no other message out there like it,

1043
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,540
 that God left the comforts of heaven

1044
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,940
 for our cross here on earth

1045
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,460
 so that we could be made right with him.

1046
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,940
 Our sin separates us from a holy God.

1047
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,900
 And when he hung on that tree,

1048
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,860
 he bridged the chasm of separation.

1049
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,340
 The Bible says for the wages of sin is death.

1050
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,380
 He died the death that you and I were supposed to die.

1051
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,660
 He lived the life that you and I could never live.

1052
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,460
 He was perfect in thought and word and in action.

1053
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,340
 No other person has claimed that,

1054
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,120
 which made him the only eligible one to die on the cross

1055
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,380
 for your sin and my sin.

1056
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,260
 And on the cross,

1057
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,660
 he soaked up every last ounce of God's judgment and wrath,

1058
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,940
 the wrath and judgment that should be poured out

1059
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,020
 on you and me.

1060
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,620
 And he got what you deserve and you get what he deserves.

1061
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,180
 It's called the great exchange.

1062
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:50,620
 And he says, now the ball is in your court and my court.

1063
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,020
 What will you do with Jesus?

1064
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,660
 How will you respond to the greatest message

1065
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,780
 in human history?

1066
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,420
 That he didn't just stay dead in the grave,

1067
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,900
 that three days later,

1068
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,300
 scripture says in history records

1069
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,440
 that he bursted forth from the grave

1070
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,740
 to defeat sin and death.

1071
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,380
 And now he gives you wisdom

1072
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,180
 to navigate through this thing called life.

1073
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,780
 In a culture that is hostile to the things of God,

1074
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,120
 you have a guide, you have wisdom,

1075
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,200
 you have life at your disposal.

1076
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,340
 How will you respond?

1077
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,140
 What will you make this life about?

1078
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,900
 Will it be about you or will it be about him?

1079
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,520
 This message never gets old

1080
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,800
 and God will stop at nothing, even pain,

1081
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,080
 to try to get your attention

1082
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,360
 so that you see and believe this message.

1083
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,680
 It's the greatest message in the world

1084
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,360
 that man can be forgiven and united with his creator.

1085
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,920
 Let me pray that you are.

1086
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,800
 Let me pray that you will tonight.

1087
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,280
 Let me pray that you will see and have a perspective

1088
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,280
 that is eternity driven.

1089
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,080
 God in heaven,

1090
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,920
 I pray that the sound of my voice,

1091
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,680
 that there wouldn't be a man or a woman in this place

1092
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,480
 that wouldn't know you,

1093
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,400
 that wouldn't see you tonight,

1094
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,920
 that would love you

1095
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,400
 and that would bend their knee if they don't.

1096
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
 And that you would meet them in their sin

1097
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,200
 and in their destruction.

1098
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,880
 And God, you would forgive them and make them whole,

1099
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,080
 not through their work,

1100
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,920
 but through your work on the cross

1101
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,880
 and through your work on the cross.

1102
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,280
 And through that God,

1103
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,640
 we would begin to walk and live and move and breathe

1104
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,960
 and make decisions from your wisdom,

1105
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,160
 from the wisdom that you gave Solomon

1106
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,680
 in the book of Ecclesiastes.

1107
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,760
 God, would you have your way in this place?

1108
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,040
 Would we be free to worship now?

1109
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,440
 Would we be free to sit and ponder?

1110
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,880
 Would we do whatever you are calling us to do?

1111
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,040
 Would we not leave this place

1112
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,120
 and just go about our life and not leave changed?

1113
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,560
 Christ, in we pray, amen.

1114
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,560
 Amen.
