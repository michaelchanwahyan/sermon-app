1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:20,900
 All right.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,520
 How you guys doing?

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,920
 Dallas, Fort Worth, you guys doing well?

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,420
 All right.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,840
 Well, it is so fun to be with you guys.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,380
 God has used the porch to change my life in so many ways.

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,140
 And so it's a joy to be up here.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,160
 It really is surreal.

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,000
 Recently, we were on a porch leadership retreat.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,280
 And so what that means is about twice a year,

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,280
 our staff team and our key volunteers,

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,520
 we'll just get out of Dallas.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,960
 And there'll be about 20 of us.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,440
 And we just spend time together, really.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,060
 We want to just kind of deepen bonds

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,360
 of those who are serving and leading here.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,600
 And the agenda is just to have as much fun as possible,

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,940
 honestly, and hopefully know and love each other more

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,160
 at the end of our time.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,760
 And we had one a couple of weeks ago.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
 And so we were kind of reminiscing,

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,240
 like, what's the greatest retreat we've ever done?

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,700
 What's the greatest memory?

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,160
 And the Dust Bowl came to mind.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,600
 And the retreats are often-- they don't really

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640
 happen like you think they would.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,480
 This particular time, we were headed out to Bonham, Texas.

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,120
 You familiar with Bonham?

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,560
 Yeah, a couple of you from there.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,800
 And so we had been given a lake house to use for the weekend.

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,480
 And so we were headed out that way.

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,600
 And I don't know about you, but whenever I kind of

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,720
 get out of Dallas, the busyness of just the fast pace,

35
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,520
 like I'm at a lake, I am just content to chill.

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,360
 You know what I mean?

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,640
 Like, I could just sip coffee, stare at the water,

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,960
 and I'm good, you know?

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,040
 We had a boat this particular weekend, a Malibu wakesetter.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,440
 There was just perfect glass out there.

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,780
 We could ski, wakeboard.

42
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,460
 I'm like, we have arrived.

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,080
 We don't need to do anything else.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,140
 We don't need to go anywhere.

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,880
 JP, on the other hand, the boss man, as you know,

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,840
 he kind of had a different plan this particular weekend.

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,000
 He's always after that unique shared experience.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,980
 Have you guys heard this term?

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,520
 Like, he's always trying to make memories on our team.

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,480
 And so he's like, he had seen a flea market

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,920
 coming into the lake house.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,080
 He's like, wake up Saturday morning.

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,480
 He's like, guys, we should check out that flea market.

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,680
 And I'm like, thinking in my mind, I'm like,

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
 flea market of everything we could do out here at the lake.

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,100
 Like, going to a flea market, not even in my top 10,000.

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,680
 I mean, it just like nowhere near there.

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,280
 But we do, we wake up, we decide to go there

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,440
 on Saturday morning.

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,720
 And we're having fun, kinda.

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,240
 But we see this guy there and he's standing by a race car.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,360
 And he's kind of promoting a race that was happening

63
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
 later on that night in town.

64
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,860
 And again, I'm thinking like small town Texas,

65
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,680
 dirt track, car races, people die there.

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,400
 Like, that doesn't sound fun.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
 That doesn't even sound safe, you know what I mean?

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,040
 I'm like, no, thank you.

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,140
 But again, JP's like, guys, we gotta make a memory.

70
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,000
 Let's go, let's go, it's gonna be awesome.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
 And so, maybe you're noticing a theme.

72
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,480
 We decide to go to the Dust Bowl that night.

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,840
 And the guy that was promoing, he's kinda like,

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,700
 it's close, you know, it's like just down the road.

75
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,580
 And so we take off, we're driving,

76
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,000
 and it's been like 35 minutes.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
 And we're like, JP, buddy, we are so lost.

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,400
 Like, this place is not here.

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,120
 I mean, we're driving through like trees

80
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
 where there's canopies over us,

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
 and we're not seeing cars for like 20 minutes.

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,160
 We're like, buddy, boss man, this is not the right place.

83
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,720
 Like, this feels more like the Blair Witch Project

84
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,560
 than anything.

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,240
 Like, this is, like, we're so lost.

86
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,920
 And, but bless him, man, he's like, no, no, no,

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,740
 this is the way.

88
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,760
 Like, I am sure it's gonna be awesome.

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,660
 Like, we have to stay the course.

90
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,320
 Keep going, it's gonna be great.

91
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,520
 We're like, okay.

92
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,680
 So, we keep driving, and sure enough, guys,

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,440
 we turn this one corner, and we look on the horizon,

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,560
 and in the middle of like nowhere,

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,800
 I don't even know where we were,

96
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,760
 it looked like Jerry World.

97
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,520
 It was like, what?

98
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,760
 Like, we did not see that coming.

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,520
 It is like this huge stadium,

100
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,040
 and you could hear kind of the buzz of the cars

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,120
 going around the track, and people are pulling in.

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,040
 And here's the deal, like, we had an amazing time

103
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
 that night.

104
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,100
 Like, the guy from the flea market,

105
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,600
 he came out and met us, and he was like,

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,080
 hey, yeah, come on, guys, come on in, park here.

107
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,800
 He kind of gave us the red carpet tour of the place,

108
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,880
 and he took us into the pit.

109
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,200
 We got to meet the drivers, take pictures,

110
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,000
 and we had an absolute blast.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,960
 Like, the greatest memory that we've probably

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
 ever had together as a leadership team

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,240
 was that night at the porch.

114
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,360
 And at the Dust Bowl, excuse me.

115
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,440
 And, nice, see what I did there?

116
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,040
 And here's why I tell you that story.

117
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
 Have you ever felt like, just in life,

118
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
 like maybe right now, like, you ever felt

119
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,440
 like you're just going the wrong direction?

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,080
 You know, like the path that you're on,

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
 you're just like, man, I'm not in the right place.

122
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,160
 Like, I'm just, I'm not going,

123
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,440
 I don't like where I'm at, you know?

124
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,800
 And specifically, like, is there a boss over you,

125
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,480
 an authority figure, and he's kind of calling the shots,

126
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,080
 he's kind of driving the car, if you will,

127
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,400
 and you're just like, man,

128
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,120
 I don't know that I trust that guy, you know?

129
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,360
 And if I'm honest, like, I'd like to drive,

130
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,960
 'cause I could drive a lot better than this guy.

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,920
 I have felt like that so much of my life,

132
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
 specifically as it relates to my job,

133
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,560
 which is what we're gonna talk about tonight.

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,440
 Like, guys, I have been a schizophrenic.

135
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,360
 Like, I have jumped around from job to job,

136
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,440
 industry to industry.

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,680
 I've worked at big companies,

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,200
 I've worked at small companies,

139
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,080
 I've worked for Christians,

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
 I've worked for non-Christians,

141
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,600
 I've worked at businesses,

142
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,640
 now I'm working at a church.

143
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,400
 I'm like, what am I doing, you know?

144
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,720
 But I have thought so much of my life.

145
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,600
 I'm like, am I going the right direction?

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,760
 Like, am I doing this deal right?

147
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,880
 And I have wrestled so much with the question,

148
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
 what is God's will for our work?

149
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
 And that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.

150
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,200
 What is God's will for our work?

151
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,280
 Specifically, we're gonna answer three questions tonight.

152
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,320
 We're gonna talk about who we are working for,

153
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,360
 number one, who we're working for,

154
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,320
 number two, what we are working for,

155
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,440
 and number three, how we are to work

156
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,920
 as followers of Jesus Christ.

157
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
 We are continuing this series.

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
 Colossians, you guys enjoying this?

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
 Good, a couple of you guys?

160
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,800
 You're like, bring back a dating series,

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
 those are more fun.

162
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,720
 No, this is awesome, man.

163
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,320
 Like, I love to learn books of the Bible together.

164
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,000
 And so we're continuing Paul's letter to the Colossians,

165
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
 and Paul is doing what he so often does

166
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,280
 in a lot of his letters.

167
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,760
 If you look at him, he will kind of start very high level

168
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,240
 kind of doctrine, theology,

169
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
 towards the beginning of the letter,

170
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,600
 and then he'll come back around and go,

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,960
 okay, this is what it looks like to apply that.

172
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,120
 Like, this is how we're gonna live that out.

173
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
 And so the text that we're gonna cover tonight

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,320
 is going to do that, Colossians 3, 17.

175
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,520
 You can turn there, and we're gonna go through,

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
 actually, the beginning of chapter four.

177
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,120
 So I invite you guys to turn there.

178
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,840
 Read with me in verse 17.

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,160
 "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed,

180
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
 "do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus,

181
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
 "giving thanks to God the Father through him.

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,640
 "Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands

183
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,600
 "as is fitting in the Lord.

184
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,920
 "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.

185
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,640
 "Children, obey your parents in everything,

186
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,600
 "for this pleases the Lord.

187
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,440
 "Fathers, do not embitter your children,

188
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,600
 "or they will become discouraged.

189
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,040
 "Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything,

190
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,400
 "and do it not only when their eye is on you

191
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,200
 "to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart

192
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
 "and reverence for the Lord."

193
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,200
 That's a rich text.

194
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
 Two observations as I kinda started to study this.

195
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,120
 One is honestly a little bit more personal,

196
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,000
 and the other one applies to the text.

197
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,400
 I see kinda the two big, dirty S words

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,520
 of the Bible in there, right?

199
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
 You see submission, women submitting to men,

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,880
 and you see the whole idea of slavery.

201
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,800
 So I'm like, okay, so JP is out of town this week.

202
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
 He's taking his family to Disney World,

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
 and he's like, "Okay, Greg,

204
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,760
 "I know you've never taught at the porch before,

205
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,960
 "but if you could just cover women submitting to men

206
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
 "and slavery, that'd be great."

207
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,640
 And he's gonna come back next week,

208
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,760
 and I think he's talking on like prayer.

209
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,880
 I'm like, all right.

210
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,200
 Well played, touche.

211
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,880
 But here's the deal, Paul is talking to the Colossians

212
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,440
 about authority, and namely the authority

213
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,760
 that has been placed by God,

214
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,280
 like that has been hard woven into the world,

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,000
 and he gives us three examples.

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,280
 He talks about it in a marriage context.

217
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,880
 My wife, Alicia, is here somewhere.

218
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,560
 I imagine we've been married for about 4 1/2 years.

219
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,440
 And really quickly, you just see

220
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,920
 that God has made us really different, right?

221
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,000
 There's not necessarily roles and ranks,

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,160
 but he has made me, he's given me the role

223
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,600
 of kinda headship and leadership of our marriage.

224
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,080
 You can just see how he makes us different in those ways.

225
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,440
 The second context he gives us is parenting.

226
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
 We have a 2 1/2-year-old daughter, a little Cora.

227
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,520
 And again, you just quickly see like the safest place

228
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,800
 for Cora to be is under our authority.

229
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
 Like it is a very, very good thing

230
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,960
 for there to be authority in Cora's life.

231
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,400
 And sometimes we just have to go,

232
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,800
 baby, you just need to trust me on this one.

233
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,120
 Like I know you don't fully understand,

234
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,720
 but you just need to do it this time because we said so.

235
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,560
 You know what I mean?

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
 Like it is a very good thing

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,960
 that there's authority in her life.

238
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,360
 And the third context, which we're gonna talk about tonight

239
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,480
 is in a slave and master context.

240
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,320
 And before we do that, we have to talk about

241
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,800
 kinda slavery in the Bible.

242
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
 Does the Bible condone slavery?

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,840
 And here's what you need to know about that

244
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
 before we move forward.

245
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,840
 The slavery in the Bible is a very different slavery

246
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,040
 than what we experience kind of in our nation's history.

247
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,560
 It's not a slavery that's based on race.

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
 Primarily, it's actually much more based

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,560
 on kind of financial or economic status.

250
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,720
 And so most of the people would actually voluntarily

251
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,800
 enter into kind of the slave master relationship.

252
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
 So it's very, very different.

253
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,320
 And if you think about it, it's very, very similar

254
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,200
 when you think slave master in the Bible

255
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,160
 to employee, employer.

256
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,520
 You know, it's very similar to the jobs that we hold today.

257
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,320
 And so that's what we're gonna spend our time

258
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
 talking about tonight is most relevant

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,480
 to kind of our life stage here at The Porch

260
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,280
 is this kind of employee, employer context.

261
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,960
 And last thing before we dive in, I just wanna say this.

262
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,840
 God is talking about doing everything for his glory,

263
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,520
 and he starts talking about authority.

264
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,680
 And it seems that one way that Paul is saying

265
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,720
 that we can glorify God is to pay very, very close attentions

266
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,640
 to the authorities that God has put over us,

267
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,000
 because he puts those over us in his sovereignty.

268
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,280
 That is key to understanding this text

269
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
 that we're gonna cover tonight, all right?

270
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,520
 So let's keep reading, verse 23.

271
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,920
 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart

272
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
 as working for the Lord, not for human masters.

273
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
 Let me say that again.

274
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,240
 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart

275
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,640
 as working for the Lord and not for human masters.

276
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,040
 My first point really question tonight,

277
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,800
 who are we working for?

278
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,160
 And I have found, you know, in my heart,

279
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,960
 like two very, very different options

280
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,200
 when it comes to who I am working for.

281
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,360
 Like I know the scripture, like I see this,

282
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,280
 work for God, I get this, like God is leading me to life.

283
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,040
 But in my flesh, like I have jumped on that roller coaster,

284
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,760
 maybe you guys have too, of working for the applause of man.

285
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,600
 You know what I mean?

286
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,120
 Just like those approvals, I see people shaking their head,

287
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
 like we call them attaboys on staff here.

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,000
 And maybe you've experienced that, guys,

289
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,960
 but that is just such a terrible way to live, is it not?

290
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,680
 And it is a roller coaster.

291
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,200
 It's up and down and it's unfulfilling

292
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
 and it's unsatisfying.

293
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,360
 And I just think that God has so much more than that.

294
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,800
 Paul, earlier in his letter to the Galatians,

295
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,160
 wrote it this way.

296
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,640
 He said, "Am I now trying to win the approval

297
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,240
 "of human beings or of God?

298
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,780
 "Or am I trying to please people?

299
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,020
 "If I was still trying to please people,

300
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,160
 "I would not be a servant of Christ."

301
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
 That's Galatians 1:10.

302
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,760
 And here's the deal, guys, like preparing for this message,

303
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
 like I've never been up here.

304
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
 I don't do this often, I'm sure you can tell.

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,960
 But I was doing pretty great, you know?

306
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,620
 I ran through it actually with JP before he left

307
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,160
 and that kind of felt like a spanking, honestly,

308
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,000
 but that's okay.

309
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,120
 But today, like I was preparing for this

310
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,960
 and I was really praying

311
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,600
 and I just started to get really anxious.

312
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,500
 Like I really wasn't feeling like that,

313
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,160
 but I just started to think, you know, about the people.

314
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,160
 You know, like I don't even know most of you guys,

315
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,440
 but I'm like, I hope you like me, you know?

316
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,600
 I hope it's good.

317
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
 And I'm like, you know, Todd and the elders,

318
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
 like they're texting me, like,

319
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,440
 I hope you do great, we're gonna listen in.

320
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
 I'm like, what do you mean you're gonna listen in?

321
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,840
 Like, what does that mean?

322
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,160
 And you know, I've got friends here and family here tonight

323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
 and there's just, there is a huge part of me

324
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,520
 that longs for your approval, you know?

325
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,440
 And that, again, that's just a rollercoaster

326
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
 that God invites us off of, you know?

327
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,160
 And he just says, I can, I have so much more for you

328
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
 than that, Greg, you know?

329
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,000
 And he just says, live for an audience of one.

330
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
 Like, when we work for God, it's so different, you know?

331
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,800
 And if you think about it, like our bosses,

332
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,920
 they might see, they might not see,

333
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,080
 but like God never misses one act of our love,

334
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,720
 our service, our hard work.

335
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,080
 Like, he doesn't miss a thing.

336
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,640
 He is the one that matters, not the people.

337
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 I have to keep reminding myself of that.

338
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,720
 But here's the deal, like, if we are doing this right,

339
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,320
 like if we are working for God,

340
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,000
 it absolutely means that we submit,

341
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,560
 that we work hard for the authorities

342
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,280
 that God puts over us, why?

343
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,840
 Because he is sovereign.

344
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,880
 There is no authority over us

345
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,240
 that God doesn't intentionally place.

346
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,560
 That's Romans 13, one through two.

347
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,680
 And so if we are serving God, we will serve our boss.

348
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,400
 There was a guy that used to serve here with us.

349
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,420
 We'll call him Carl, Carl.

350
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,560
 Man, that's tough to say, back and forth.

351
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,240
 And so Carl was a really, really sharp guy.

352
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,480
 And he was with an energy company in town,

353
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,520
 and he was kinda young, but he was on the fast track.

354
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,280
 But he was kinda too young for the CFO role,

355
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,120
 and so they brought a new guy in

356
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,560
 to be the CFO of his company.

357
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,960
 And very quickly, like from talking to Carl,

358
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,840
 it was like the new CFO, like he was not gonna cut it.

359
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,240
 Like, he was not connecting well

360
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,180
 with the people that he was managing,

361
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,580
 and they were like, man, this guy's gonna be out.

362
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,880
 And sure enough, he did get fired.

363
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,040
 And before he was leaving, like,

364
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,840
 this is a very smart, educated CFO experience.

365
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,440
 And he sought out my friend Carl, and he just said,

366
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,560
 he said, hey, buddy, I need to ask you a question

367
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,000
 before I leave, like I'm dying to ask you something.

368
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,160
 And my friend Carl's like, sure, yeah, what is it?

369
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,120
 And he's like, okay, what did I do differently with you?

370
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,080
 He's like, what do you mean?

371
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,360
 He's like, well, you see, I had like nine other people

372
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
 that I was managing, and those relationships,

373
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,080
 like they were going terrible,

374
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,760
 but you, like we had something good going there.

375
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,760
 And so like, whatever I was doing with you,

376
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,820
 I need to do more of that in my next job.

377
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,160
 And whatever I was doing with these guys,

378
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,320
 I should probably not do more of that.

379
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,600
 And he said, he said, oh, okay.

380
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
 He said, well, that would be

381
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,200
 because I don't really work for you.

382
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
 And the guy was like, the CFO was like,

383
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,800
 what are you talking about?

384
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,200
 I'm the CFO, have you seen the org chart?

385
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
 Like, you absolutely work for me.

386
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,680
 He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

387
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,600
 He's like, you don't understand.

388
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,640
 He's like, I'm a Christian, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ.

389
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,000
 And so even though you were doing the same things,

390
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
 like you were doing all those things

391
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,440
 you were doing over here,

392
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
 like you were doing those here,

393
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,980
 but I wasn't serving you.

394
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,440
 Like I was serving my Father in heaven,

395
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,040
 and he commands me to serve the authorities

396
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,880
 that are over me.

397
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,240
 And so I was serving him.

398
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,380
 And yeah, I was serving you,

399
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,760
 but it was 'cause my eyes were focused on the Lord.

400
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,720
 We work for God.

401
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,920
 Next verse, verse 24.

402
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,760
 Since you know that you will receive an inheritance

403
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,160
 from the Lord as a reward,

404
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,000
 it is the Lord Christ you are serving.

405
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,320
 My second question tonight, what are we working for?

406
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,160
 Again, I feel this pull in my heart.

407
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,480
 If I can be honest, I hope we always can here.

408
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,040
 I feel the desire to have more money.

409
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,760
 If you can imagine people at a church,

410
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,720
 we don't make a ton of money.

411
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
 But I just feel the desire for more,

412
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
 just a little bit more.

413
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,840
 What if we could have just a nicer car?

414
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,360
 What if we could do some upgrades to our house?

415
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,720
 If we could travel somewhere awesome this summer?

416
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,560
 What if I could just have a little bit more money?

417
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,600
 Or honestly, more than that,

418
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,320
 what I'm more susceptible to

419
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 is just that I would work for a sense of worth.

420
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,040
 A sense of value and identity.

421
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,720
 I'm truly working to be somebody.

422
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,960
 I wanna promote myself.

423
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,680
 I wanna feel like I'm making a name for myself.

424
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,440
 You ever feel that way?

425
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,040
 The American dream, a sense of accomplishment.

426
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,000
 In the same way, I just think God invites us

427
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
 into so much more than that.

428
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,120
 Not that that's necessarily wrong,

429
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,920
 but God has more for us.

430
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,880
 This is a crazy idea, and it's so biblical,

431
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,280
 that we are going to receive an inheritance

432
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,680
 from the Lord as a reward.

433
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,600
 What does that mean?

434
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,000
 The ways that we work in our job today, tomorrow,

435
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,520
 we are storing up a reward.

436
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,280
 If we are a follower of Jesus Christ,

437
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,640
 if we are a believer in him,

438
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,280
 we are storing up rewards that are so much bigger

439
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,360
 than even this world, bigger than us,

440
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,760
 bigger than our bosses.

441
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,880
 Jesus said it like this in Matthew 6.

442
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,680
 He said, "Do not store up for yourselves

443
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,000
 "treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy,

444
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,040
 "where thieves break in and steal,

445
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,680
 "but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven

446
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,960
 "where moth and rust do not destroy,

447
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,000
 "where thieves do not break in and steal."

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,520
 You see, we are invited to work for so much more,

449
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,920
 things that will matter forever and ever.

450
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,200
 We work for his rewards, we work for God.

451
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,080
 Verse 25, "Anyone who does wrong

452
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,520
 "will be repaid for their wrongs,

453
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,240
 "for there's no favoritism.

454
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,580
 "Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair,

455
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,600
 "because you know that you also have a master in heaven."

456
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,280
 My third question tonight, how are we to work?

457
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,440
 What does this look like for us to apply this,

458
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,720
 for us to live this out?

459
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,880
 First and foremost, it means that we work hard.

460
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
 Verse 23, "Work with all of your heart."

461
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,560
 We know that work is good, right?

462
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,120
 Like work was in the garden before the fall happened,

463
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
 like work was a good thing.

464
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,040
 And then we also know that because of the fall

465
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,880
 in Genesis 3, work is going to be hard.

466
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,000
 Like it is a promise from God

467
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
 that our jobs are going to be difficult.

468
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
 It's going to be a painful toil, the scripture says.

469
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,880
 And here's the deal, I don't know how to

470
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,680
 kind of sugarcoat this, but if you pay attention

471
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,160
 to like what historians and people that study generations

472
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,040
 are saying about us, millennials,

473
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,880
 those of us in our 20s and 30s, in regards to our work,

474
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,320
 like it's not pretty, here's what they're saying.

475
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,120
 We are known for being uncommitted.

476
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,160
 We're known for being flaky, for not respecting authority.

477
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,440
 We are staying at our jobs for the least amount of time

478
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,780
 as a generation compared to any other that's come before us.

479
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,780
 You see, we wanna change the world,

480
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,360
 but we are unwilling to put in the long,

481
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,480
 hard work that is required.

482
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,840
 That's what they're saying about us.

483
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,080
 Recently, our staff, we got to hear from Gary Haugen.

484
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,420
 You guys know Gary Haugen, IJM?

485
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,000
 Maybe not, let me tell you about him.

486
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,320
 IJM is an unbelievable organization.

487
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,920
 They're based in Washington, DC.

488
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,720
 And what they do is they partner with third world

489
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,360
 governments and kind of local police authorities.

490
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,980
 And they go in and rescue women and children

491
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,660
 who are being held as sex slaves

492
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,000
 in the sex trafficking industry, unbelievable evil.

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,020
 And he came and spoke to our staff,

494
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,900
 and they were on the heels of this huge,

495
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,700
 unbelievable rescue, I believe it was in Cambodia,

496
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,220
 where they had freed all these women and children.

497
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,780
 And he just said, "Hey guys, can you imagine

498
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,120
 "like how many millions of people would love to serve

499
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,060
 "on my staff that day?"

500
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,380
 You know, it's like SEAL Team Six type stuff.

501
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,780
 Like they're going in there, they're getting the bad guys,

502
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,140
 they're giving them justice,

503
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,740
 they're getting the women and the children,

504
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,900
 they're pulling them out of this awful evil,

505
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,700
 and they're sharing the gospel with them.

506
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,760
 They're helping them be restored and recover

507
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,940
 from this miserable life that they've been in.

508
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,740
 He just said, "Can you imagine how many millions

509
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,920
 "of people would love to be on our staff that day?"

510
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,940
 But he just said, "Here's what people don't understand."

511
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,820
 Nobody gets this.

512
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,000
 He said, "There were tens of thousands of hours

513
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,100
 "put in on the front end.

514
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,980
 "Like before this day could happen,

515
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,900
 "there were long days, tens of thousands of hours

516
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,420
 "of hard work."

517
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,260
 What does that mean?

518
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,180
 Like we would fly into nowheresville, Africa or Asia.

519
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,380
 We would drive all day, all night to a quote unquote court

520
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,300
 that just didn't really happen to kind of meet that day.

521
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,340
 And we would try again.

522
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,340
 I mean, long, long hours.

523
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,700
 And he just said, "Do you know how many people

524
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,380
 "they wanna be on my staff that day?"

525
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,280
 He said, "Man, it's just a few.

526
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,060
 "It's just a few."

527
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,300
 You see, our generation, we forget the importance

528
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,700
 of just simple faithfulness, like long obedience

529
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,080
 in the same direction, faithfulness.

530
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,960
 Number two, it means we work with excellence, right?

531
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,980
 If we're working for God, it means we work for excellence.

532
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,080
 We've said here before,

533
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,100
 excellence honors God and inspires people, right?

534
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,980
 And if we're not at our jobs working with excellence,

535
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,580
 then we're not gonna really have credibility.

536
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,420
 You know what I mean?

537
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,760
 Like people aren't gonna trust us.

538
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,180
 It's like, "Yeah, hello, I'd like to invite you

539
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,020
 "to the porch.

540
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,540
 "It's this thing that I go to on Tuesday nights."

541
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,620
 And they're like, "Yeah, is it as awesome

542
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,040
 "as you are at our job?

543
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
 "No, thank you."

544
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,700
 You know what I mean?

545
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,140
 It's like, I was actually gonna invite you to join our team

546
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,460
 and do some work around here, right?

547
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,700
 I mean, it's like, it's not gonna happen.

548
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,020
 Like we're not gonna have the credibility that we want to.

549
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,360
 We work with excellence.

550
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,940
 Number three, we work for God.

551
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,800
 We work like he will tell you face to face how you did

552
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,780
 because he will.

553
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,640
 It's a crazy idea.

554
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,920
 We work for his rewards.

555
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,280
 We've talked about this.

556
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,120
 And here's the deal.

557
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,760
 Like if God is the one who sees and knows everything,

558
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
 like he doesn't miss anything.

559
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,760
 And if he's the one who hands out the rewards,

560
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,840
 then why are we so worried about man, right?

561
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,460
 They can't even give us something

562
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,080
 that it's not even theirs to give.

563
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,920
 You know what I mean?

564
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,960
 God is the one who doles out the rewards.

565
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,980
 There's no favoritism.

566
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,760
 Like the scales, the scales are absolutely equal.

567
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,280
 Number five, it means we do the right thing

568
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,040
 regardless of who's watching, of who it's for.

569
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,800
 Like we do the right thing.

570
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,800
 Lastly, for those of us who are entrusted

571
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,200
 with leadership, verse one,

572
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,120
 "Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair,

573
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,480
 "because you know that you also have a master in heaven."

574
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,760
 What does this mean?

575
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,240
 It means that if we're the quote unquote master

576
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,640
 in the story, it means that we will face

577
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,540
 our true master one day, right?

578
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,200
 And so the ways that we are fair and just and kind

579
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,560
 to our employees, like we will be accountable

580
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,760
 before the true master one day.

581
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,520
 The quote unquote masters have a master as well.

582
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,400
 Before I came on staff at Watermark,

583
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,480
 I worked for about nine years or so

584
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,640
 in the business world, kind of finance and private equity.

585
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
 And for about five of those years,

586
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
 I worked for a very, very godly man.

587
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,060
 And he also happened to be unbelievably wealthy,

588
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,060
 like billionaire with a B, like big time money.

589
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,800
 And when you have that kind of money, I learned,

590
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,680
 you have a lot of people to help take care of that money.

591
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,280
 You know, and you have banks and people help you

592
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,780
 with your investing and all that kind of stuff.

593
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,800
 And so we decided to take all of those people

594
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,400
 that kind of helped with investments

595
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
 and all that kind of stuff out of town for a weekend

596
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,240
 to his ranch that he owned.

597
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,640
 And the goal was just like, let's get to know these people.

598
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,880
 We're working closely with them.

599
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,720
 They're serving us.

600
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,360
 Like, let's spend some time together.

601
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
 And also we were gonna just kind of update them

602
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,980
 on the business, what was going on,

603
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,800
 and just some of our needs that we might be having

604
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,320
 over the next six months.

605
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,800
 And here's the deal.

606
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,760
 Like, I was over this event

607
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,100
 and we got to just like roll out the red carpet.

608
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,840
 I mean, it was like a five star event.

609
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,420
 We had private planes that we got to fly people

610
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,120
 into the ranch on.

611
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,920
 We served like these unbelievable meals,

612
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,340
 like steaks from deer that had been killed out at the ranch.

613
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,280
 I mean, it was like amazing.

614
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,520
 And these people that were coming out,

615
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,160
 I mean, they're like the CEOs of local banks

616
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,000
 and that kind of stuff,

617
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,820
 kind of the big wigs, if you will.

618
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,160
 And we had an unbelievable time.

619
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,960
 And throughout the weekend,

620
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,080
 people kind of knew that I was over the event.

621
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,320
 And they're like, man, this is so fun.

622
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,380
 Like, you're doing a great job.

623
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,220
 Thank you.

624
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,520
 I see the ways you're working hard.

625
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,760
 And I just wanna thank you, man.

626
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,640
 We're having a blast.

627
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,440
 And so it was awesome.

628
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,180
 And we're like done.

629
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,980
 Like, we're almost there, 11th hour.

630
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,100
 We're outside of the house.

631
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,720
 All the cars are kind of lined up,

632
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,280
 the rental cars to take everybody to the airport.

633
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,640
 And I mean, we are like there.

634
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,960
 And there's one truck that's kind of out of order

635
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,240
 and would have kind of prohibited everybody else

636
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
 from driving to the airport.

637
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,800
 And so I saw that.

638
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,000
 I noticed it was also the owner's truck.

639
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
 And I was like, but let me, I'll just move it around.

640
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,720
 I'll kind of loop it around the corner.

641
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,200
 And that way everybody can get to the airport.

642
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,720
 So I get in that car, I slam it into drive.

643
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,020
 I look and I see a car and I see the house,

644
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,060
 but I'm like, surely that's plenty of room for me

645
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,740
 to just kind of drive right through there.

646
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,580
 You know what I mean?

647
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,140
 And so I do do that.

648
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,420
 And it was like,

649
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,140
 (imitates siren)

650
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,980
 like all across the house.

651
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,780
 And I was like, oh man, I was so close.

652
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,740
 And I, and so I kept driving and I pulled the car

653
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,260
 around the rest of the cars.

654
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,800
 And I put it in park and then I get to do the walk of shame.

655
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,120
 You know, like everybody's outside and they're like,

656
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,520
 oh my goodness.

657
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,900
 And you could see in their eyes, you know,

658
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,720
 they're like, why did you do that?

659
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,400
 Like he was going so well, you know, like,

660
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,460
 why, oh, why couldn't you just finish it?

661
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,300
 You know?

662
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,120
 And I was feeling the same thing.

663
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,600
 And, and so I'm like walking up and the owner,

664
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,320
 like he comes out of the crowd, you know,

665
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
 all these people watching.

666
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,040
 I'm like, oh, I snap into like,

667
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,440
 hey, don't worry about that truck.

668
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
 Like I will fix that truck the next time

669
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,820
 you come out to this ranch, that truck will be perfect.

670
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,480
 I will wax it myself, fix it, it's going to be amazing.

671
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,500
 And he just, I'll never forget this for the rest of my life.

672
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,120
 He put his arm around me and he said, Greg,

673
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,260
 he said, you have worked so hard this weekend.

674
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,040
 Like, this has been such a blast.

675
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,600
 This has been amazing.

676
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,960
 Like I've seen your work.

677
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
 He said, you're not fixing that truck, man.

678
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,800
 And he said, you know what else?

679
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,240
 He said, I'm not even fixing that truck.

680
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,080
 Why not?

681
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,360
 Because it will serve as a reminder for me

682
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,080
 for the rest of my life, for the hard work

683
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,120
 that you put into this event.

684
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,940
 Like this will be a trophy.

685
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,420
 I will always remember you when I look at this truck.

686
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:00,640
 And to my knowledge, like the truck hasn't been fixed since.

687
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,300
 And here's the deal, like I will never,

688
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,520
 I will never forget that story, you know,

689
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,440
 of the ways that that master treated me, his slave.

690
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,520
 And even more important, like I'm confident

691
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,960
 that the real master will not forget the ways

692
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,080
 with which that master treated me.

693
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,660
 Unbelievable grace and unbelievable kindness.

694
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,520
 In conclusion, who do we work for?

695
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,880
 Colossians 3 says we work for God.

696
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 He is the boss.

697
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,100
 Colossians 3 says we work for rewards from him,

698
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,420
 things that are so much greater

699
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,200
 than anything this world has to offer.

700
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 Colossians 3 says we work like he's watching

701
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,720
 because he is, he is.

702
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,800
 And he not only hands out the rewards,

703
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,480
 but he repays evil to those who do wrong to us.

704
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,640
 There's no favoritism, the scales are even.

705
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,560
 And here's what I absolutely love about this idea.

706
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,080
 Like if we work this way, like if we work hard,

707
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
 if we work for God, if we're working for greater things,

708
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,980
 if we're worshiping God truly through our work,

709
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,640
 like can we really be in the wrong place?

710
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
 You know, like we get so paranoid.

711
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,500
 It's like, what is God's will for me?

712
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,120
 Is it job A or is it job B?

713
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,440
 Like, is God gonna speak to me and tell me it's job A?

714
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
 Like, I don't know, you know,

715
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,640
 but we get so paranoid about, am I in the right place?

716
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,300
 I've been like this for so much of my life.

717
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,920
 But here's the deal, if we are working this way,

718
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,480
 we're gonna be in the right place, right?

719
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,500
 We are gonna be honoring the Lord in our work,

720
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,040
 and that's what matters.

721
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,920
 You see, it's not what you do that matters,

722
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,560
 but how and why.

723
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,820
 It's not what you do that matters, but how and why.

724
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,820
 Verse 17, whatever you do, verse 23, whatever you do.

725
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,520
 You see, we don't need to necessarily

726
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,860
 do something different tomorrow.

727
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,140
 We probably just need to do

728
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,420
 the very same thing differently.

729
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,220
 We don't need to do, we don't need a new job.

730
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,600
 We need to do the job that we had today

731
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,220
 and that we're gonna have tomorrow.

732
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,380
 We need to do that differently.

733
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,320
 Let me close with a story, a friend of mine

734
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,800
 who just honestly got this right.

735
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,360
 It was one of our volunteers, Jeremy.

736
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,720
 And Jeremy was a sharp guy,

737
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,480
 but he didn't have this unbelievable job,

738
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,320
 you know what I mean?

739
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,560
 It wasn't some sexy industry,

740
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,000
 and he'd be like, whoa, that's awesome.

741
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,120
 But here's the deal, he viewed his job as his ministry.

742
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,440
 He would always talk like that.

743
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,840
 And I was like, oh, that's cool.

744
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,640
 And so he would always talk about the relationships

745
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,480
 that he was building with the people that he worked with.

746
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,640
 And he was good at what he did.

747
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,840
 He would always get invited on these sales incentive trips.

748
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,800
 I remember 'cause he was single and I was single,

749
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,600
 and I was always like, are you gonna invite me

750
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,880
 to go on that Mexico trip with you?

751
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,720
 That'd be awesome.

752
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,540
 He never did.

753
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,480
 But here's the deal, the guy loved people well.

754
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,040
 He was building relationships, he was working hard,

755
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,000
 and he would just go, man, that job,

756
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,200
 it might be a random job, but it is my ministry.

757
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,080
 And there was one particular time,

758
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,120
 we were driving down 75, I still remember it.

759
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
 It was the weekend, we were going to lunch in Uptown,

760
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,240
 and his cell phone rang, and it was a random number.

761
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,080
 And he's like, oh, I'll get it.

762
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,960
 And on the other end was a coworker, a middle-aged woman.

763
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,960
 And she just said, hey, Jeremy,

764
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,280
 I didn't know who else to call.

765
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,560
 I just found my husband dead.

766
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,920
 And I have no idea where to turn or what to do,

767
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,800
 but I thought about you.

768
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,080
 Like, you seem different, and so do you have any,

769
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,640
 like, what do I do, what do I do next?

770
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,040
 You see, Jeremy had earned the right

771
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,640
 to speak into this woman's life.

772
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,880
 Like, he barely even knew her,

773
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,000
 but there was something about the ways

774
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,520
 that he worshiped his God, the ways that he worked,

775
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,560
 that the first person that she thought of was Jeremy.

776
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,080
 And she didn't have a faith, she didn't have a church home,

777
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,240
 and we got to minister to this family

778
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,840
 in an unbelievable way.

779
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,800
 We got to do the service here at Watermark,

780
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,360
 and she's been coming here, and her son was a young adult.

781
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,000
 He's been coming here to the porch,

782
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,040
 and we've got to minister to him.

783
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,200
 I think what I want you to know tonight

784
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,320
 is that God has so much more for our jobs.

785
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,360
 Like, if we work this way,

786
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,240
 like, there is so much greater life and purpose.

787
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,760
 It is so much more rewarding.

788
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
 Like, the American dream, the Dallas dream,

789
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,160
 the people chase, money and status and success,

790
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,200
 like, it's empty.

791
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,760
 Like, some of you have experienced it,

792
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,200
 and you're like, I know, like, it is empty.

793
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,920
 And God has things that are so much bigger

794
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,680
 and so much better.

795
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,280
 I pray that we would pursue him,

796
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,440
 that we would not worship our work,

797
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,240
 but we would worship God through our work.

798
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,320
 We pray that we would.

799
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:52,520
 Father, I thank you for your word, Lord,

800
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,880
 and just the ways that you instruct us to life, Lord,

801
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,040
 and not that you're trying to withhold good things

802
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,880
 from us, but that you have so much more for us, Lord.

803
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,640
 And specifically in our work, Lord,

804
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,680
 I don't know where everybody is at,

805
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,760
 but I doubt we're in our dream jobs, Lord.

806
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,800
 I pray that we would find purpose in working for you.

807
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,920
 Lord, I pray that we would work hard.

808
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,040
 I pray that we would not work

809
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,840
 for just the temporary fleeting trinkets of this world,

810
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,280
 that we would work for you.

811
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,360
 We would have the next life on our mind.

812
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,080
 You say there are rewards

813
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,960
 and an inheritance waiting for us on the other side.

814
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,240
 Father, help us not to settle.

815
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,840
 Lord, I just pray that we would leave here tonight

816
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,840
 just on fire for the mission that you've put before us.

817
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,920
 Not that we would worship our work,

818
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,600
 but they would worship you through our work.

819
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,960
 I pray all this in Christ's name, amen.

820
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:55,960
