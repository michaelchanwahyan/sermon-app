[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:21.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.840]   Ports, how we doing, baby?
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.820]   Hey.
[00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:47.160]   I missed you guys.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.880]   Long break.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.240]   Everybody have a good Christmas.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.600]   Happy New Year.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.680]   So I want to start with this.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280]   I was traveling over the break, and so I
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.800]   had went to Las Vegas of all places, OK?
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.920]   It was a mission trip.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.200]   And so no, it was regarding the book.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.800]   I was meeting with the publisher there.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.640]   And coming back, I'm on a Southwest flight.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.520]   They don't have assigned seating.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240]   And yeah, I love them too, but no assigned seating.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.980]   And so I'm walking through the plane with my luggage,
[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.600]   and I'm trying to find a spot.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.160]   But the only thing that's there is middle section,
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.040]   because I was like group seven or something.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.840]   And so the only seats available are middle seats.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.040]   And so I go all the way to the end of the plane.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.000]   I make the mistake of putting my luggage up
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.800]   in the place in the back, because that's all that was
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.920]   there.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.680]   And then I walked to the front, and there
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920]   was a middle seat in bulkhead.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.240]   And I'm 6 foot 7 inches tall, and so I'm like,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.640]   bulkhead will work.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.000]   But there's two guys there praying diligently
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.480]   that nobody sits there.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.960]   And I'm like, hey, I'm sorry, guys.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.680]   I've got to sit.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.280]   And so I sit down between these two guys.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   One of them is a bigger guy, and the other one, super cool guy.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.120]   And so I sit down.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.580]   I don't want to invade their space.
[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.760]   And I'm like, OK, how are you guys doing?
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.000]   And I'm just kind of riding like this.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.360]   This dude passes out immediately.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.480]   He's snoring.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.720]   And this guy, he's got the Chelsea boots, the tight jeans,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.240]   shirt tucked in with the blazer, hair slicked back,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   little scruff.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.560]   He's who I want to be.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.720]   And just looks good.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.760]   Like he's getting cool all over me.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   And so before we leave, we're on the ground.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.760]   And so dude pulls out his phone, and he just starts swiping.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.960]   Not her, not her, not her, not her, not her.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.920]   Some of you were doing this before we
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.320]   were worshiping in here.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.840]   We can track that through the web.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.480]   No, we can't.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.040]   It's OK.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.240]   It's OK.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.840]   And so he's swiped.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.040]   I mean, dude swiped.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.280]   I mean, he must have gone through 75 girls.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.080]   I'm not even kidding, while they're there.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.480]   And then we lift off.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.480]   Hey, put your phone on airplane mode.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.480]   And then we're up in the air.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.520]   And so I'm still like, dude's snoring.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.920]   And I look over here, and now he's looking at his photos.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.400]   And I'm trying not to look at his photos with him,
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.440]   but he's like, hold him.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.840]   He's like, kind of hold him in front of me.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.720]   And so I'm like, you know, glad.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.800]   And it's-- and like every other one is a naked girl.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.880]   I know none of you have ever done that.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.440]   Don't do that.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.840]   Here's just free advice.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.280]   Never send someone a naked picture of yourself, ever,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.880]   because it lives out there forever.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.080]   What you go on the internet stays in the world forever.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.960]   Don't do it under any circumstance.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.000]   I don't care if you're married to him.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.840]   Don't do it.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.400]   And so I'm-- of course, I'm like, OK, look away.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.880]   And now I'm thinking, all right, I've
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.200]   got to share the gospel with him.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.080]   Like, it's going to happen.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.120]   Like, how do you want it?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.640]   You know, it's coming at you.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   And so I'm praying.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.200]   I'm like, Lord, what do I do?
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.800]   How do I go?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.000]   You know?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.680]   Is it bridge?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.320]   Is it chair?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.160]   Is it-- you know, what are we going to go with?
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.040]   And so right then, I'm like, OK, I know where I'm going to go.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.880]   And so I like turn to him, and he like puts his earphones in.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.920]   And I was like, OK, so now I'm like, all right, that's OK.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.000]   Maybe I'll just ask him, hey, do you
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.960]   mind taking those out, because I want
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.920]   to talk to you for a second.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.840]   You know?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.920]   And then-- and so now I'm thinking, all right,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.680]   what I want to do?
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.480]   And now we have hours of flight.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.840]   And I'm just thinking, OK, I've got to share the gospel.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.640]   I'm going to grab him in the airport or something, you know?
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.080]   And so as we're going down, you know, they come up,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.120]   and they say-- not like crashing, but landing.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.880]   They come over, and they say, OK, you know,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.760]   we're about to land.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.080]   You know, please prepare for landing.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   And he takes them out.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.640]   And he goes, you know, we'll be in Dallas in 30 minutes.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.280]   I'm like, all right, I've got 30 minutes.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.480]   I've got 30 minutes with this guy.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.160]   And what you feel like in a moment is you feel like, man,
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.720]   I've got 30 minutes to save this guy.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.920]   Now, we know that's not true.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.960]   It's the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.120]   But I'm like, I've got 30 minutes to give
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.160]   this guy everything I can.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.920]   All right, you guys are in a series, self-care.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.840]   You guys have--
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.240]   I love the way you started the year.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.360]   I feel like I've got 30 minutes with you
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.280]   to just share the best advice, the best wisdom that I know.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.480]   And really, what I want to give you
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.560]   are seven statements that this ministry has been built on.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.640]   So grab a pen and a piece of paper.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   It's going to be a little bit different tonight,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.040]   like drinking from a fire hydrant.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.680]   But write down as fast as you can these seven things.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.560]   These are seven things that this ministry was actually
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.640]   built on, seven things that God used.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.880]   And I can say that humbly because none of these
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.560]   are my things.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.200]   These are things that I've learned from much wiser people
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.120]   than myself, some of whom you're going to hear from later.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.600]   These are just things that I've stolen, all right,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.240]   that I'm going to give back to you.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.760]   But it's the best advice that I can give you in the 30 minutes
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.640]   that I have.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.080]   And so the first one, are you ready?
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.000]   Don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.720]   Now, if you've been running with us long,
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.160]   you've heard some of these things.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.640]   They've come up through the years.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.520]   Don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.600]   Here's what that means.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.320]   If you just do what you want to do,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.640]   you miss out on what God wants you to do.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.400]   That means for the rest of your life,
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.520]   don't just do whatever you want to do.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   Life's not just about doing whatever you feel like,
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.680]   all right?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.720]   I've lacked discipline in my life in seasons.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.400]   And so my family and I, we went through a 40-day fast.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.320]   It's hard.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.080]   We fasted from all sugar, all things sweet, all carbohydrates.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.720]   It's funny.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.320]   My six-year-old was in class, and they
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.760]   set a cupcake in front of him.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.720]   He told his teacher, he goes, I can't eat that.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.120]   I'm doing the keto diet.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   And I was like, buddy, it's a fast, not really a diet.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.760]   Anyways.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:09.960]   And in those 40 days, just got to experience a closeness
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.280]   with the Lord that I wouldn't have experienced
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.360]   if I hadn't done that.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.680]   And then after the 40 days, it's so easy
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.600]   to slip back into laziness and whatnot.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.440]   And so tomorrow, you might not feel like getting up early
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.560]   and getting in the Word.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.080]   You may not feel like eating right.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.520]   You may not feel like working out.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.160]   And you may feel like sleeping with your significant other.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.400]   You may feel like going back to that website
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.840]   or clicking that hashtag.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.600]   But guess what?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.680]   Life's not about doing whatever you feel like.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.760]   Do hard things.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.720]   It produces godliness.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.600]   Discipline yourself for godliness.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.200]   Like our generation, they're saying about us,
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.040]   we change jobs an average of every two years.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.760]   You know what that means?
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   We never get great at anything.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.920]   We jump into something.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.120]   And then when it gets difficult, we
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.080]   don't feel like doing it anymore.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.040]   We jump into something else.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.960]   Then we jump into something else.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.880]   Then we jump into something else.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.280]   Then we jump into something else.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.240]   All of the sudden, you find us at 45 years of age,
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.160]   we haven't mastered anything because we just
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.800]   tried things every two years.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.520]   Don't follow your appetite.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.000]   That's what the scripture tells us.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.960]   It's Philippians 3.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.960]   It's talking about enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   Enemies of the gospel, this is how he describes them.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.880]   Their destiny is destruction that's held.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.720]   Their god, little g, god is their stomach.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.600]   Then their glory is in their shame.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.520]   Their mind is set on earthly things.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.560]   What does it mean that their god is their stomach?
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.040]   What does that mean?
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.240]   Think about that for a second.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.360]   Their god is their stomach.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.600]   It means they eat what they're hungry for with no regard.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.360]   If they want it, they take it.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.720]   And who are they?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.840]   Enemies of the cross of Christ.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.200]   Don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.480]   One thing that will help you with this
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.400]   is who you hang around with.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.600]   So number two is change your playmates in your playground.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.320]   Change your playmates in your playground.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.440]   This is the number one advice that I
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.160]   have given throughout the years outside of the gospel
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.560]   when someone comes to me and they
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.640]   want to change their life.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.320]   In fact, just yesterday, I'm talking
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.680]   to a couple who's going through a challenge in their marriage.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.160]   And they're like, what do we do?
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.200]   And I'm like, you guys keep bumping up
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.400]   against the same things.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.480]   You have terrible influences around you.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.360]   You're going to places that set yourself up for failure.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.800]   Change your playmates in your playground.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.280]   The Proverbs chapter 13, verse 20
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.160]   says, "Walk with the wise and become
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.720]   wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm."
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.800]   1 Corinthians 15, verse 33 says, "Do not be misled.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.760]   Bad company corrupts good character."
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.680]   Guys, you know this.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.800]   Like if you get drunk when you go to the bar,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.760]   stop going to the bar.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.280]   OK?
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.320]   If you sleep with him when you go to his apartment,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.240]   or y'all get handsy, or you cross lines, check this out.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.960]   Don't go to his apartment ever.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.520]   Ever.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.040]   OK?
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.320]   So change your playmates and your playground.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.560]   Where you-- I'll just say this.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.080]   Where you go and who you go with,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.320]   that's half the battle in life.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.040]   You want to change your life?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.080]   Change where you go and who you go with.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.600]   That's going to be half the battle.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.680]   It's no secret.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.160]   I've told this story over and over and over,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.080]   that what God has used more than any other thing in my life
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.960]   to take me from perverted, porn addict, womanizer, drug user,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:52.400]   alcoholic, to pastor, as crazy as that is, was community.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.840]   He placed godly people in my life that I didn't even like.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.440]   I know, you're like, no, they know.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   They know I didn't like them.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Some of them are here.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.280]   Today, I love them as much as any human being.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.880]   Because they're brothers.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.560]   They're closer.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.720]   They're friends that are closer than family.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.520]   God used them to change my life more than anything.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   He's going to do the same.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.200]   So don't find community that you like.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.520]   Don't look for people that have the same things in common.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.920]   Just find someone who loves Jesus more than you.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.840]   And God will use that.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.920]   Number three, I would say pay close attention
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   to what you pay attention to.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.520]   Pay close attention to what you pay attention to.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.360]   The reality is everything you do is
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.600]   going to be in your mind.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   The reality is everything that you
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.680]   do for the rest of your life will start in your mind.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.880]   Your thoughts.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   Your mood.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:52.800]   You're sad.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.360]   You're mad.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.480]   You're in a bad mood.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.280]   Starts up here.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.440]   It all comes from the thoughts that you feed.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.040]   This is so true.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.520]   Your mind is a container.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.600]   And that container, the contents of that container
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.080]   can be rotten or life-giving.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.080]   And this is an area where I will tell you that science is
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.600]   catching up to theology.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.440]   So just the other day, a couple of weeks ago,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.120]   Jimmy Fallon led the country in a one-minute meditation.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.280]   Some of you guys have meditation apps on your phone.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.920]   Buzzwords like meditation or headspace or mindfulness.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.200]   These are common ideas in our generation.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.680]   This is something where we really, really, really
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.280]   get it right.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   But it's something that God said thousands of years ago
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.360]   that we would start our days by meditating on his word,
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.520]   filling our minds with the things of God,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.480]   fixing our minds on the things not of this world,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.720]   but of his world.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   Colossians 3, verse 2 says, "Set your minds
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.000]   on the things above, not on earthly things."
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.040]   And so you need to pay attention to what you're
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.280]   paying attention to.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.640]   If you're thinking, man, wow, she's hot,
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.920]   or why don't I have that, or I wish I had her boyfriend,
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.720]   or I don't know why I can't go there,
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.200]   or my boss, or the president, la, la, la.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.080]   As you're saying these things, as you're
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.700]   feeding your mind these things, you're
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.360]   affecting your entire body, your livelihood.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.920]   This is why the scripture says, "Do not conform,"
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.000]   it's Romans 12, 2, "Do not conform any longer
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.760]   to the patterns of this world, but be transformed,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.840]   be different, be renewed by the renewing of your mind."
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.240]   And you want to know God's will is?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.040]   It says, "Then you will be able to test and approve
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.720]   what God's will is, his good, pleasing, and perfect will."
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.060]   The battles, if you look in history over wars
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.660]   that have been fought, battles that have been fought,
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.900]   they've been fought over real estate, territory, nations.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.500]   There is a battle right now being fought over your mind.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.780]   It is a supernatural, spiritual battle.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:59.780]   The enemy, Satan, he wants your mind, he wants your thoughts,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.740]   he wants your thoughts, and he wants to fill it
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.220]   with envy and wrath and jealousy and judgment
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.260]   so that he can ruin your entire life.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.940]   So he wants your ruin.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.820]   And the scripture commands us over and over and over
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.060]   to renew our minds, to think about whatever's true,
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.740]   whatever's pure, whatever's right, whatever's lovely,
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.180]   whatever's honorable, if anything is admirable,
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.180]   excellent, or praiseworthy, that we would think
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:32.820]   about these things, it's Philippians 4.8.
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.220]   So fix your mind on Jesus.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.620]   Set your mind on the things above.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.140]   And just like your mind is a container, so is your heart.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.260]   Number four, don't follow your heart, inform your heart.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.460]   Don't follow your heart, inform your heart.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.300]   This comes from Proverbs 4.23.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.700]   It says, "Above all else, guard your heart,
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.260]   for it is the wellspring of life."
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.300]   Your version of Bible may say,
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.220]   "Keep your heart with all diligence."
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.780]   That word keep there, what it means,
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.420]   it's like the way you keep food in the refrigerator
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.300]   from going bad, from spoiling.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.340]   Keep your heart from spoiling.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.300]   The way you keep it from spoiling
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.980]   is you be very careful with what you let in.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.180]   And I know I sound like your mom or your grandma right now
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.860]   when I talk about music and movies and magazines
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.660]   and things you read, but there's truth to that.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.540]   And again, science is catching up.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.100]   And it's like all of a sudden, you're like,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   you know, a girl's like, "Man, I just don't want,
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.820]   I'm just not attracted to good guys."
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.980]   That's because you've gone through a university
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.700]   that has trained you not to be attracted to good guys
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:37.360]   by what you've used to entertain yourself.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.180]   You start listening, like start looking
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.740]   at the words of that song.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.940]   And you're like, "Why do guys just wanna use me to hook up?"
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.660]   Focus on what you're watching.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.940]   Think about what you're feeding your heart.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.200]   It's like a bloodhound.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.220]   You've trained it to look for those things.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.600]   And you're like, "He's awesome, and he makes great money,
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.400]   and he looks good, but should I date him?"
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.300]   You gotta inform your heart, right?
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.160]   It's in Corinthians 6, 14.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.580]   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.800]   You wanna tell your heart where to go.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.080]   One time my daughter, Presley, and I, we were traveling.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.800]   I was traveling for a speaking deal.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.960]   I took her with me, and we got in the rental car.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.920]   And because I didn't know where I was going,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.600]   we were actually in DC, and I wanted to go see
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.880]   the monuments and whatnot.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.960]   I got a rental car with a GPS, and as I get in it,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.320]   I began to follow the GPS.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   And I'm thinking that we're going to the Abraham,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.800]   I'm sorry, the Abraham, the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.200]   And as we're driving, I realized at some point
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.440]   that we've traveled 20 miles the wrong direction
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.000]   because I never put the destination in the GPS.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.960]   It was the person who had the car before me.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.920]   I was still going wherever they wanted to go.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.320]   You wouldn't follow a GPS that you haven't entered
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.460]   in the destination, you haven't told it where to go.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.320]   Likewise, don't follow your heart until you've informed it,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.560]   until you've told it what to look for.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   Hey, I want to find this kind of man.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.880]   I want to find this kind of woman.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.480]   I want to surround myself with these kinds of people.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.640]   A sign of immaturity is when someone's feelings
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.960]   define their reality.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.400]   It's a sign of immaturity.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.360]   A sign of maturity, right,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.400]   is when you learn to test your feelings.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.320]   As my friend has said many times,
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   feelings are real, but not always reliable.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.260]   Meaning you can't always trust them.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.060]   You want to make sure you fed that heart
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.080]   before you follow it, that you've told it where to go.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.920]   And so if you're telling it where to go
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.520]   with The Bachelor or romantic comedies or pornography,
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.200]   it's going to lead you to a cliff, to a dead end,
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.080]   to breakup after breakup after heartbreak after heartbreak.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.640]   And the reason this all matters
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.280]   is because who you belong to.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.740]   And that's number five,
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.300]   whose you are is more important than who you are.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:16.240]   Whose you are is more important than who you are.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.680]   Yesterday my family and I were in ATB.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.920]   It was a new grocery store to us.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.400]   And it was huge.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   And my six year old, I looked up and I couldn't find him.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.820]   I didn't know where he was.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:36.800]   Monica's like, "Where's Weston?"
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.860]   I was like, "Oh."
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.880]   She was like, "You had him."
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.760]   I was like, "I'm sorry.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.720]   I lost him."
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.380]   And so I'm going through the grocery store
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:45.800]   trying to find him.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.520]   And I see that this lady had found him,
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.180]   and she was holding him for us, if you will,
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.160]   like, "Hey, we'll find your parents."
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.080]   When that lady saw that he was lost,
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.080]   she noticed he was lost.
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.280]   His eyes were filling with tears.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.480]   You know when you're lost in the grocery store,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.720]   it's like you're never going to see your parents again.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.040]   I don't know why that is,
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.200]   but he's just like, "I'm done.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.600]   I'm going to the orphanage."
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.180]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.800]   And so I come to him.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.200]   And when she found him, what she didn't ask is,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.400]   "Who are you?"
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.020]   She asked, "Who's your mom and dad?
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.760]   Who are your parents?
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.120]   Who do you belong to?"
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.940]   And friends, for the rest of your life,
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.240]   there's going to be seasons where you find yourself lost.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.600]   You're like, "How did I get here?"
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.600]   And in that moment, don't be focused on who are you.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.840]   You focus on whose are you.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.320]   That's the way to be found.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.920]   Who do you belong to?
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   And what this means is you can stop trying so hard
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.240]   to make a name for yourself and to build a kingdom
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.640]   because you're the son and daughter to a king.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.120]   It's who you are.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.020]   You're his.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.560]   That's the most important thing about you
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.400]   is that you are a child of God.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.000]   It's 1 John 1, verse 12.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.020]   Yet all who did receive Jesus,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.880]   to those who believed in his name,
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.540]   he gave the right to become children of God.
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.880]   You're a prince, you're a princess.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.340]   You belong to God.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.800]   You're not just somebody, you belong to somebody.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.780]   You're not just somebody, you're somebodies.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.060]   With a capital S, the creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.640]   And can we talk about why this matters for a second?
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.000]   Because what you do with your life matters.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.280]   What that guy on that airplane does with his life matters.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.840]   What he does with God's daughters matter.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.020]   It matters to God, it matters to their dad,
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.780]   their capital F, father.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.200]   It matters.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.020]   1 Corinthians 6, 18 through 20,
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.940]   says flee sexual immorality.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.100]   All other sins a person commits are outside the body,
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.500]   but whoever sins sexually sins against their own body.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.460]   It says this, do you not know, porch?
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.260]   Do you not know that your body is a temple
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.820]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.680]   whom you've received from God?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.180]   You are not your own.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.940]   Let me say it again, you are not your own.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.480]   You've been purchased, bought by a price.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.360]   Therefore, honor God with your body.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.040]   So you're his.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.620]   The other day I was staying at a friend's house.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.960]   They were out of town and I stayed at their place.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.600]   And as I was leaving, you know,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.940]   I made sure to make the bed just the way that it was
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.900]   and put everything up and do the dishes
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.900]   and put them back in the cabinet.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.380]   In fact, I was leaving, I was driving down the road,
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.340]   they live down this long road,
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.940]   I was driving down the long road
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.860]   and I was like, man, did I, you know, I had started a fire.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.020]   Like, did I turn the gas off?
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.760]   I mean, I know I did, I checked it three times,
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.900]   but I'm gonna go back one more time.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.380]   Oh, I cooked eggs that morning.
[00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.220]   Did I turn the stove?
[00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.240]   I know I did, but let me go check one more time.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.080]   You know why?
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.760]   Because it's not my house.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.780]   It belongs to somebody else.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.980]   And I wanna leave it better than I found it.
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.620]   This ain't your house, man.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.080]   This ain't your house.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.020]   Yours.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.320]   This ain't either, by the way, but yours.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.140]   Yours.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.180]   You got it on loan.
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.300]   Make sure you leave it better than you found it.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.260]   Young men, young man,
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.220]   you hang out with her.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.720]   Make sure you leave her better than you found her.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   Terrifying verses in 1 Thessalonians 4, verse six,
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.420]   it says that God is the avenger of these things.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.860]   Man is sobering.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.800]   God is the avenger of these things.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.840]   And so I don't want you to leave here and just try harder.
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.880]   Do more.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.000]   Grab the bootstraps.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.360]   Like, that's not, we're looking for surrender.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.960]   A really, a posturing of I can't, but you can.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.360]   May I become less, you become greater.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.400]   The way that I've said it through the years here,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.620]   the way that I've heard it said,
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.140]   if dependence is the goal,
[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.660]   then weakness is the advantage, that's number six.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.820]   If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.560]   See, the world is gonna try to tell you
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.980]   that you need to be a bigger, better version of you,
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.100]   that you need to roar and get out there and get yours
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.460]   and make a name for yourself and hurry, hurry, hurry
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.220]   and save a bunch of money and retire
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.940]   and count seashells and whatnot.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:44.580]   It's going to tell you that you don't need anybody else.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.940]   And I want you to know that that's not the gospel.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.020]   The gospel says that you're a sheep
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.400]   in desperate need of a shepherd,
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.100]   that you need someone to take care of you
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.460]   and that you don't have to boast in your strength,
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.500]   that you can boast in your weakness
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.080]   because when you boast in your weakness,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.100]   it gives glory and points to God.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.460]   When you begin to talk about what he's delivered you from,
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.280]   when you're like,
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.380]   I'm never gonna talk about that abortion,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.980]   you begin to start to talk about that abortion
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.560]   and he sees freedom from that abortion,
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.500]   you begin to repent from your sins and speak them out.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.460]   He takes your mess and makes it your message.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.800]   And as he makes it your message
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.260]   and you continue to communicate it,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.780]   he makes it your ministry
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.300]   and he grows a ministry around you.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:28.140]   And all of a sudden,
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.020]   what the enemy, you went to use for evil,
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.360]   God, the creator who loves you is using for good.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.400]   It's like he's given you a key
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.920]   and you're taking that key, which is your story,
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.280]   and you're unlocking the cells of other people
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.440]   sitting in those prisons that you sat in.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   You have power, authority, it says in the scripture,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.940]   to help other people find freedom.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.040]   What else are you gonna give your life to?
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.300]   What else you wanna do with your life?
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.980]   Why, why wouldn't you do that?
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.640]   First Corinthians 12, verse nine,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   where Paul is talking about the thorn in his flesh,
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.720]   he said, "But God said to me,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.040]   "my grace is sufficient for you.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.560]   "My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.220]   So Paul says, "Therefore, I will boast
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.380]   "all the more gladly about my weakness
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.660]   "so that Christ's power may rest on me."
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:26.860]   If you wanna know how dependent you are,
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.500]   there's a really simple test I can give you.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.360]   How much did you pray today?
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.080]   How much time and energy and effort
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   did you spend in prayer with the Father today?
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.780]   And this will directly tell you your dependence level,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.180]   at least today.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.680]   And if you're like, man, I didn't pray a whole lot today.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.220]   I didn't spend a lot of intentional time in prayer today.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.620]   And some of you are like thinking right now,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.540]   like, wow, man, since I woke up to right now,
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.100]   I didn't pray one single time today.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.960]   And I would just tell you, you're not dependent on God.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.160]   And see, Jesus, his whole job description,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.780]   his criteria, what he does, he's a savior.
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.980]   He saves people.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.980]   To save people, there has to be somebody who needs saving.
[00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.740]   And so if you're like, I'm gonna get to God
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.460]   because of what I've done or because of who I am
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.420]   or because I tried hard or by my efforts,
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.460]   because I'm good, then you don't need saving.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.100]   The gospel, you getting saved,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.720]   like you getting into heaven to be with God forever
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.020]   starts with you saying, you know what?
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.140]   I need saving.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.580]   I can't do it on my own.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.180]   I keep bumping my head up against the same wall,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.580]   making the same mistakes, doing the same sins,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:43.340]   like a dog to his vomit.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.260]   I keep going to that which is disgusting and impure
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.900]   and a mockery of who God is.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.060]   I need someone to save me, to reach into the miry pit
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.160]   and set me on the cornerstone.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.300]   That is what I need.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.220]   You know what you need to get to heaven?
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.060]   Need.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:05.260]   What you need most to come to God is need.
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.660]   To be in a place where you need him, dependence.
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.340]   And how fast you are and how smart you are
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.500]   and how good looking you are and how gifted you are,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.220]   that's not gonna help you.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.820]   But when you realize your desperate need for a savior,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.340]   that's going to help you.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.060]   And so how do you know if you've done that?
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:35.920]   Number seven, your behavior follows your belief.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.840]   Your behavior follows your belief.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:52.480]   Like some of you, you've said that you trusted in Christ.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.300]   Just like me, you've said that you believe in Jesus.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.980]   You've said those words.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:01.780]   But today in your life, if you were honest,
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.680]   you know you're not trusting in Jesus.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.580]   You know you didn't trust in Jesus today.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.940]   You know what that guy told me on the plane
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.900]   when I engaged him?
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.400]   Began to share the gospel.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.080]   He said, "Oh, no, no, I believe in Jesus."
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.420]   I said, "Well, what do you believe about Jesus?"
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:25.420]   Even the demons believe in shudder.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.560]   What do you believe?
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.300]   I can say, "Oh, look, here's a chair.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.820]   "I believe there's a chair.
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.660]   "Look, there's a chair.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.500]   "I believe it's there.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.320]   "Will it hold you?"
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.480]   "Yeah, I believe it will hold me.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.980]   "Why don't you sit down in it?"
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.820]   Nah.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.740]   "No, no, go ahead and sit down in it."
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.780]   Nah, I don't want to.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.620]   I don't want to.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.520]   No, no, I mean, do you trust it would hold you?
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.840]   Yeah, I trust it would hold me.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.680]   Sit down in it.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.780]   Nah, I'm good.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.740]   I'll just stand.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.800]   I'm fine with standing.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.580]   See, I can see the chair.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.020]   I can acknowledge the chair.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.380]   I can speak the word.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.500]   The chair is there.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.400]   The chair is there.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.980]   I can say that out loud.
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.960]   I can even say, "I'm a chair follower.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.920]   "I follow the chair.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.560]   "Everywhere the chair goes, look at me.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.380]   "I'm chair follower."
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.220]   But until I trust the chair to hold me,
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.620]   that is evidence of me believing.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.860]   It's like, "Come over here."
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:19.900]   And I put my weight, and it supports me.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.860]   My life is in it.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.320]   Right?
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   Now, this is evidence of the knowledge that I spoke,
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.600]   the reality that I said, "There was a chair here."
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.440]   Now, I'm trusting in the chair.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.520]   My life is in the chair.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.500]   This is what Jesus wants from you.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.840]   This is what he wants from you,
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.360]   that you would trust in his death and the resurrection,
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.840]   his death and resurrection as a payment for your sins,
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.740]   securing you to God's kingdom,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.620]   that you're gonna be there forever and ever.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.780]   And when you know you're gonna be there forever and ever,
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.180]   then you begin to live this life here
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.180]   as though that's what matters most.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.980]   Like every minute, every breath, every heartbeat here,
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.460]   as though you're going to be there with God
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.780]   forever and ever and ever.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.040]   So eternity with you starts right now
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.080]   in the way you have conversations with people,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.860]   the way you date, the way you talk, the way you buy,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.020]   the things you like, your hobbies, how you spend your time.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.720]   It's all his.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.540]   James 1 says, "Therefore get rid of all moral filth
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.100]   and the evil that is so prevalent
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.140]   and humbly accept the word planted in you,
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.300]   which can save you.
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.660]   Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves,
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.020]   but do what it says."
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.660]   Do what it says.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.340]   Don't just say you believe in Jesus.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.740]   Do what he says.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.940]   In summary, don't let your preferences rob you of paradise.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.360]   Change your playmates and your playground.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.380]   And pay close attention to what you pay attention to.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.860]   Don't follow your heart and form your heart.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.680]   Whose are you is more important than who are you.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.060]   If dependence is the goal, weakness is the advantage.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.460]   And your behavior follows your belief.
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:25.700]   When I left that guy on that plane,
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.180]   I thought, man,
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:32.540]   God gave that brother so many talents and so many gifts.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.380]   And the world is affirming everything he is
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.580]   and what he's all about.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.780]   And the truth is from an eternal perspective,
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.500]   he is completely insignificant.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.260]   He has nothing in eternity.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:50.460]   He is wasting every breath of his life.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:56.140]   I wanna juxtapose that with 11 men
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.140]   who Jesus met on the side of a hill.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.040]   See Jesus, when he came here,
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.060]   he had one mission to save the world.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.380]   He had a message that he needed to get out there
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.580]   and he could have used anybody.
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.780]   He could have used toddlers.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.100]   He could have used geriatrics.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.060]   He could have used the elderly.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.860]   You know who he used?
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.820]   He chose to use young adults.
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.860]   Some people 18 to 35.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.020]   That was his strategy.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.780]   He walks up to them on a hillside, Caesarea Philippi.
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:27.620]   They're standing up there.
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.420]   Hey, who do they say I am?
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.480]   Some say Jeremiah, others Elijah.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.740]   One of the prophets, I don't know.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.580]   But what about you?
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.720]   Who do you say I am?
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.200]   Peter speaks up.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.660]   You're the Christ.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.980]   You're the son of the living God.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.620]   He's asking you this question right now.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:48.580]   Who do you say I am?
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.780]   Insert your name right now.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.740]   Daryl, who do you say?
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:51.620]   Michael, who do you say?
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:52.860]   Jennifer, who do you say?
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.720]   Kelly, who do you say I am?
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.580]   Sarah, who do you say I am?
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:02.780]   The Christ, the son of the living God.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.460]   And Jesus is like, that's right, man.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.960]   And I'm gonna do something
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.420]   that nothing's gonna be able to stop.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.220]   I'm gonna build my church
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.860]   and the gates of Hades won't be able to overcome it.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.460]   My favorite prophecy in all of the scriptures.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.180]   Because then those guys are like,
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.260]   what are you talking about?
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.700]   You're gonna build a church?
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.700]   What is a church?
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.680]   First of all, and Jesus, I don't know if you've noticed,
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.280]   but people don't like you.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.980]   And you're talking about building this unstoppable movement.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.220]   There's only 12 of us
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.660]   and not even so sure about Judas over here.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.380]   I mean, think we're playing.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.380]   You might be playing for the other team.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:39.160]   I mean, they kept screwing it up, right?
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.960]   Like in three verses later or just a few verses later,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.940]   Jesus is talking to the same guy who's like,
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.100]   you're the Christ, the son of the living God.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.820]   Jesus is like, get behind me, Satan.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.300]   Because he's like, no, you can't do that.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.460]   He's always messing things up.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.540]   Or he denies him to a 12-year-old girl.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.380]   Like, no, I don't know him.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.220]   You know, he's his best friend.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.060]   No, who is that?
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.880]   I don't know that guy.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.260]   You know, and he's like,
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.040]   they keep messing it up, these guys.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.620]   They were cowards, complete and total cowards.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.760]   But they said that he was the Christ.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.540]   Maybe that's you tonight.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.820]   I believe he's the Christ.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.720]   You go back tomorrow, you're a coward.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.500]   But something happened.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.700]   Something awesome happened.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:25.080]   In Matthew 28, eight chapters later.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.060]   See, what's happening, they saw Jesus on the cross.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.860]   They saw him die.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.060]   They saw him take his last breath.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.740]   They saw him stabbed in the side, the blood run out.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.860]   They saw him show back up now.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:41.800]   Like they saw the greatest act of all time.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:49.140]   And those guys, they gave their entire life
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.100]   to advancing that message.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.620]   Church history tells us that 10 of the 11
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.860]   died martyrs' deaths.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.280]   They were crucified, beheaded, crucified upside down,
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.380]   stabbed to death.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.420]   One was skinned, his head cut off.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.620]   One was boiled alive and then sent to a prison
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.680]   on a remote island, all because they would not deny
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.520]   the resurrection.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.500]   These cowards now became courageous.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.560]   And it's not just their death, they gave their life to it.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.400]   Why?
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.580]   Because they believed it.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.800]   And if you're here and you believe that Jesus
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.540]   is the son of God who died for your sins
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.120]   and God raised him from the dead
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.700]   and his Holy Spirit lives in you,
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.380]   then what are you doing with your life?
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.300]   Because those guys that died, that wasn't a tragedy.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.380]   They are heroes.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.500]   They told somebody who told somebody who told somebody
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.660]   who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.380]   who told somebody who told somebody who told somebody
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.040]   who told somebody who told you
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.540]   so that you would know who he is.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.500]   That guy on that plane, too cool for school guy,
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.620]   that's a tragedy.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.640]   His life is wasted.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.780]   It's a tragedy.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.580]   He's got a lot of girlfriends.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.460]   He's got a lot of naked pictures of those girlfriends.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.560]   And he is a tragedy.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.940]   A tragedy.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.460]   I don't want you to be a tragedy.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.080]   And so here's what we're gonna do.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:24.380]   It's been amazing to watch this ministry
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.580]   grow beyond the walls of not just this building
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.820]   or this church or this city,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.100]   but this week I'm gonna get emails from South Africa
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.440]   and Australia and London and people all over the world,
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.340]   not to mention the United States, Tennessee and Alabama
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.940]   and Florida and California and Seattle
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.180]   because of what God is doing through you.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.220]   And what we're going to do is we're going to grab
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.460]   all of those people from around the world
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.180]   and we're going to bring them here Memorial Day.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.280]   And we're going, my friend is leading us in the charge
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.340]   of giving them a vision for what the church can be.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.140]   It's the same vision that captured my heart
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.140]   here 17 years ago.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:15.100]   And I don't want you to miss it.
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.200]   Would you watch this?
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.340]   Watch this.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.620]   You know, there's gotta be more,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.140]   more meaning, more purpose, more life,
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.900]   something to do that matters.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.360]   You long for it and it seems like you're so close
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.480]   to finding it.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.000]   You've looked everywhere you can think of to find it.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.160]   You've done all the good things to achieve it,
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.240]   but you still keep missing it.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.560]   In your heart, you know the answer is Jesus,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.240]   but you're still trying to make that connection.
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.640]   You know there's more, you were made for more.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.240]   And there has to be a way to connect your love of Jesus
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.320]   and your God given desire to do something great,
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.660]   to lead, to change the world.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.840]   Good news is there are others like you.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.220]   Those who are ready to stop simply going to church
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.500]   and now ready to be the church.
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   Some say the church is irrelevant, fake and outdated.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.580]   We say it's the movement you were made for.
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:20.420]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.380]   It's what you were made for.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.880]   Hello, Porsche, how we doing?
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.220]   (congregation cheering)
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.460]   From the very beginning of us pouring in to our friends
[00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.840]   who were young adults in Dallas, Texas,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.600]   and now as JP said, around the world
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.480]   and in different locations that every week gather
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.720]   like you guys do here to stream and talk about this,
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.680]   we've had something at the very front of our minds,
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.400]   and that something is this,
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.360]   that we would raise a generation that God would move
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.560]   in such a way that we would surrender to God
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.220]   and then we would change the world
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.520]   through the lives of young adults.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.180]   It's what Jesus has always done.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.640]   You guys are in this room and gathering right now
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.200]   in this place and meeting in other places,
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.640]   but specifically the ones that are here with me in Dallas
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.940]   and the ones that are in Fort Worth.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.160]   You guys are gathered in places because when I was your age,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.720]   by the kindness of God, I surrendered to God.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.860]   I started to do these principles that JP talked tonight.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.120]   And I was sick and tired of being underneath a dead,
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.240]   feckless human.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.280]   Come and listen to me, show up, shut up, and pay up, church.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:31.200]   I go, there's nothing in this Americanized version
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.780]   of the church that even remotely looks like this,
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.520]   gates of hell won't stand against it,
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.160]   we're gonna change the world kind of community of friends.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.600]   And so I quit complaining about what I was underneath
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.040]   and I started to just undertake what God had for me.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.660]   And me and a bunch of folks your age just started to pray
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.360]   that God would take more of our hearts
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.640]   and we wouldn't follow our hearts, we'd inform our hearts,
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.700]   and we wouldn't just say one thing and do another.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.900]   We'd be people who believe that Jesus was alive
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.900]   and he still wanted to rescue people,
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.060]   he still wanted to do something great,
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.760]   and we said, Lord, if you're willing, why not with us?
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.740]   And then 19 years later, I'm no longer a young adult,
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:10.700]   but we've used our lives and our fortune
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.920]   and our sacred honor to invest in people.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.120]   A bunch of us moved as much resources we had
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.260]   into putting together locations
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.340]   and putting on those locations buildings
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.420]   that we could gather people and encourage people
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.660]   and equip people, and we prayed that one day,
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.220]   room would fill up with a generation that was well behind us
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.280]   that they would surrender their hearts to God
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.160]   and God would use them to change the world.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.920]   And then we started to gather you guys away
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.160]   for two or three days.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.160]   And we could only fit about 1,200 into a place
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.420]   that we gathered you, and in 15 minutes,
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.020]   it was filled up with a third of the folks
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.540]   who were already in the room with us.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.600]   And we just said, man, this has gotta stop
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   because there's a lot of places around the world
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.980]   that don't have something like this,
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.180]   and there's a lot of places around the world
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.700]   that don't have what I've been experiencing
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.580]   with my friends for the last 19 years,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.260]   and we believe you're the generation who can change that.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.000]   And so we just said, you know what we're gonna do?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.340]   We're gonna go and we're gonna take our lives, our fortune,
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.780]   and we're gonna invest it in gathering young adults
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.260]   from all around the country, all around the world
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.100]   at Memorial Day.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.580]   We're not gonna take just 1,200 of 'em
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.500]   that we fill out in 15 minutes away on Labor Day.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.820]   We're gonna rent the convention center in Dallas.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.640]   We're gonna invite some amazing friends in with us.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.140]   We're gonna have incredible artists.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.380]   We're gonna have an incredible time,
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.460]   and we're gonna be able to invite thousands of our friends.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.600]   Let me just tell you something.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.700]   That means each of you can invite two people
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.140]   who live somewhere other than right here
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.300]   who don't have what we have every week,
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.340]   who don't have great teaching, great fellowship,
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.320]   who don't go, I'm not really sure I believe in God yet,
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.720]   maybe, for some of you, but if there is a God,
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.560]   I wanna learn about him from these people
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.800]   because they're not playing, man.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.540]   They're not just trying to get me to come to some meeting.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.700]   They're telling me there's something worth living for.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.020]   This is your moment.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.820]   This is what the plan has been all along,
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.680]   and it's time for us to invite other people to the party.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.140]   And Memorial Day weekend,
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.700]   we're gonna spend three days together,
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.060]   and like I said, we're not gonna try and bait you
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.260]   with amazing, tantalizing things right now.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.300]   I'm just gonna tell you something.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.780]   You wanna be surprised and delighted?
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.620]   Come on.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.660]   You wanna come and you want to expose your friends
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.460]   to what you get every week 'cause this is not about you?
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:28.180]   This is about the opportunity, and the moment is now,
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.740]   and a lot of you guys have surrendered to God.
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.740]   Let's just say half of you are.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.620]   That means you get to invite four friends,
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.980]   folks who went to college with you,
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.140]   folks that you work with,
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.860]   people you sit next to on planes,
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.420]   and it's going to quickly sew up and sell out,
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.220]   and so now's the time for you to go
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.820]   and bring 'em in so we can build 'em up
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.540]   so Jesus can get busy.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.620]   Watch this.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.420]   Planting churches and forming communities like the porch
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.340]   all across the world.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.540]   That's what we wanna do.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.620]   The big call coming out of our gathering
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.660]   that's gonna happen Memorial Day weekend is not,
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.140]   hey, will you go invite four more friends for next year,
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.940]   and we'll rent out American Airlines Center,
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.100]   and the next year, Jerry World,
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.860]   will it be 100,000 of us that will gather?
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.820]   Because what we wanna do is after we gather,
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.780]   we wanna train, equip, and scatter,
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.100]   and we wanna plant communities of Christ followers
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.340]   in other cities than the ones we're already in.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.100]   We wanna disciple 'em, some are gonna come live with us.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.820]   We're gonna give 'em an opportunity to be trained
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:24.260]   and live with us and walk with you,
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.060]   and then we're gonna send 'em back in smaller clans.
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.300]   We're gonna say if you're someplace already
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.420]   where there's a community of Christ followers
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.740]   that are serious about the kind of things
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   we talked about tonight,
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.980]   then let's send you back more strengthened
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.580]   and more ready to partner with them to change the world,
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.340]   and if there's not one, we're gonna help you start one.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:45.260]   And the vision from the beginning has been
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.460]   that we're gonna surrender our lives to God,
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.700]   and God's gonna do something only he can do.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.660]   He's gonna use the likes of us to change the world.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.900]   Listen, this is what God's up to.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.140]   He's going to do this, and if you wanna jump in with me
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.700]   to make disciples and be disciples
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.020]   and be people who don't just come to something that's cool,
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.420]   but we go, hey, I wanna live for something that's great,
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.260]   then let's go.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.620]   But this is something we're doing for you.
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:14.620]   We're not gonna throw something that makes us feel good
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.740]   that in 15 minutes it's safe and it's covered.
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:19.700]   No, we have risked a lot.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.420]   We're bringing in friends.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.700]   We're bringing in folks that are gonna bless you,
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.620]   but you gotta go get your friends and say,
[00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.260]   hey, man, you know the thing I talk to you about
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.580]   that I do every Tuesday night?
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.660]   We're gonna do something for you.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.500]   You gotta come.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.620]   You gotta hang out with me,
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.940]   and it's not gonna be available for long.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:39.900]   In fact, next week, in fact, to gather with us,
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.660]   it's gonna get a little bit more expensive.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.100]   Next Tuesday when you walk in here,
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.540]   it'll be a little bit more expensive.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.860]   If you invite 10 people,
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.380]   it'll be a little bit more expensive,
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.380]   but you wanna get in on it right now,
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.060]   and what I'm asking you to do is to be prayerful.
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.220]   I'm gonna give you a second, just a moment,
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.340]   just to pray with me.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.100]   Lord, who are the people that I've been trying to tell 'em?
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.900]   I think there's something about Jesus.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.380]   I think there's something about really his people,
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.620]   not this thing that we used to be underneath
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.020]   that maybe we grew up around or grew up running from,
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.620]   but there's something about God and Christ
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.460]   that I'm starting to see.
[00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.280]   Some of you guys have had lives radically change.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.300]   You found forgiveness, you found healing, you found life,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.140]   and this is your moment to invite some friends
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.220]   who will come and not just come to an event,
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.140]   but will walk out of there with an opportunity
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.500]   and a clear plan that we're gonna give them
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.260]   to disciple them and to start or strengthen
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.660]   the work of God where they live.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.960]   That's what we want to do,
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.020]   but we're doing this for you
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.740]   'cause we believe it's your surrender to God.
[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.460]   We believe you're ready to change the world,
[00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.540]   and we're gonna gather people to scatter 'em
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.580]   for the glory of God.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.900]   Are you ready?
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.980]   Are you ready?
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.520]   All right, I'm telling you,
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.620]   we can only take about 8,000 this first year.
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.540]   That's all we're committed to.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:49.720]   I hope, frankly, if you guys,
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.320]   if I have to write a huge check and say,
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.280]   "Take your place back," and we go find a bigger place,
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.380]   make that our problem, all right?
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:58.820]   But let's just fill the room up.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.740]   There's nothing worse than having an amazing time
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.180]   and seeing five empty seats and go,
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.260]   "Man, why wasn't my friend here?"
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.860]   Because this would've been amazing to share with them,
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.980]   but we're not doing this thing every week for you.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.900]   We're doing it because God has invited you
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.960]   to do something that's gonna make your life
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.360]   everything you dream that your life is gonna be.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.620]   The way I say that last point is people say what they think,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.940]   they do what they believe.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.580]   You guys say you wanna be the generation
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.540]   to change the world.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.140]   Well, you got a chance to do it,
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.980]   and we're gonna equip and we're gonna inspire.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:35.140]   We're gonna bless.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.380]   We're gonna laugh.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:37.280]   We're gonna play.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.460]   We're gonna serve.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.800]   We're gonna equip and we're gonna launch,
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.020]   and we're gonna awaken the world
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.860]   to the glory of our God and our King.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.060]   Let me give you about 30 seconds just to pray.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.660]   Just say, "God, man, bring to my mind
[00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.760]   the names of some friends that I work with, folks.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.660]   I've been telling about this.
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:56.220]   It's time for me to use and broker my relational capital
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.540]   to say, 'Come and see,' and come hang out with us."
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.920]   There's a generation before us that made some decisions
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.060]   that something's happening here,
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.900]   that raised up a JP and a DMARV
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.260]   and all the other folks that are serving you here
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.180]   so you can be blessed, and it's your turn.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:15.980]   Father, would you just bring to mind friends,
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.140]   maybe who are just somewhere who know you already,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.100]   who just need to be encouraged,
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.940]   that we need to have relationships with
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.420]   so we can strengthen them and we can help them start
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.580]   what you want for them in your city,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.260]   that we pray would outshine anything
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.580]   that we're experiencing in this thing called the porch,
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.940]   'cause we don't care about the porch.
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.060]   We care deeply about Jesus, and Jesus, I thank you
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.960]   that you care deeply about my friends.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.100]   And so, will you bring to mind people
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.780]   that don't know you yet, that I should invite them
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.380]   to come and hear about the kindness of God,
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.800]   and would you bring to mind people
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.580]   that just need some encouragement to be strengthened,
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.500]   that are gonna be the leaders
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   of the not just the next generation,
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.620]   but of your work in the world?
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.820]   Lord, speak to my heart.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.400]   (gentle music)
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:22.060]   Father, I thank you for this room,
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.580]   and I thank you for rooms just like it,
[00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.460]   spread out right now in little dots
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.940]   in this little region that we're in,
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.940]   but I pray that dots would grow all around the country,
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.540]   not porches, but communities of authentic,
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:39.220]   transformed, Spirit-empowered, surrendered to God,
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.020]   free from the bondage to sin and self,
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.020]   folks who don't worship their stomach,
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:47.500]   but who have a Savior that has delivered us
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.380]   from a way that seems right to us, but has led to death.
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.620]   Would you use us, this generation,
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.740]   would you use this room and rooms like it,
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.180]   would you use this age group, Lord,
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.740]   to preserve your people and to reach those
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.840]   who right now are staggering to slaughter?
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.060]   Would you let us take advantage
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.920]   of this resource that's being put together,
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.060]   for others to see your kindness, your goodness,
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.660]   the joy and the fun we have,
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.140]   not when we're exploiting each other
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.660]   for momentary sexual pleasure,
[00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.940]   or numbing ourself with alcohol and drugs from pain,
[00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.100]   but Lord, may we have a party in this city
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.220]   that Dallas itself notes there's something different
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.060]   about these people, there's something better
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.420]   than what Vegas offers here,
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:29.900]   and these people love each other,
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.540]   and they serve each other, and they say they know a king,
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.740]   and we pray that that kingdom's reign
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.500]   would extend throughout all the earth.
[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:37.860]   Lord, would you bring your people,
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.300]   would you use us to be the ones that invite them?
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.180]   And I pray, Lord, as we now stand before you and sing,
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.740]   the greatness of your renown would spill out of us,
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.020]   and our lives would be the beginning
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.380]   of this next work that you're going to do,
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.900]   and may Jesus alone be the one who is glorified in his name.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:56.740]   Amen.
