[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.760]   - Porch, how we doing?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400]   We doing okay?
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.560]   Hey, it's great to see you.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.540]   Thanks for making the time to be with us this evening.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.260]   So glad that you would be here.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.540]   I'm really excited for tonight.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.380]   I don't know about you.
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.200]   I don't know how you're feeling tonight.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.980]   I am personally very excited.
[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.600]   Number one, we got some fall weather rolling in,
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600]   which is praiseworthy, right?
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.440]   Can I get an amen?
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.260]   That's a good thing.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.180]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.300]   Really excited that you're here tonight.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.980]   I don't just say that, I actually mean that truly.
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.540]   I do not take it for granted that you would be
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.860]   in this room with us every single Tuesday.
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.900]   Part of me always wonders,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.140]   God, are they gonna come back?
[00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.500]   And yet you keep due.
[00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.620]   And so we're gonna keep showing up.
[00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.860]   And I think God's got good things in store.
[00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.380]   We also really excited because we've got young adults
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.300]   from all over the nation tuning in tonight.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.580]   Everybody give it up for Porch Live.
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.060]   Yes, give it up for them.
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.740]   Love what God's doing around the globe.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.380]   It's so cool that we get to be a part
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.620]   of what he's doing in your life.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.900]   We truly mean it, that we believe God can be
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.460]   with any person anywhere and at any time.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.660]   And that includes those of you that are tuning in.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.520]   Special shout out to Porch Live Fresno, Boise, and Dayton.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.540]   So glad you're here.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.140]   And then also we've got some very special friends
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.060]   that are tuning in with us from Alaska.
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.960]   So we're really glad y'all are on too.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.740]   And then last thing that I'm really excited about
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.180]   is the person you're gonna get to hear from tonight.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.580]   We're taking a brief pause in our series Disciple
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.420]   because we wanted to introduce to you someone
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.500]   that we're really excited to tell you about.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.340]   As you've heard me say from this stage before,
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.900]   something that I feel a personal passion for
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.420]   as a young adult ministering to young adults
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.580]   is finding the next generation of communicators,
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.340]   people that I think we should be learning
[00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.020]   and listening from.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.780]   And so I'm excited because tonight I get to introduce
[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.460]   to you someone that I think fits that bill
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.660]   really, really well.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.140]   Someone that I think is a trusted voice
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.140]   on any platform she stands on and is also a trusted voice
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.740]   in my own personal life as I've just gotten
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.420]   to observe her from afar and then do ministry
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.500]   alongside her in different capacities
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.860]   and learn from her myself.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.060]   So I'm really excited to introduce to you
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.140]   a good friend of mine.
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.140]   And so Porch, I need you to do an exceptional job,
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.100]   like the best job.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.380]   She's from Portland.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.060]   You gotta give her a big Texas welcome
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.540]   when she comes to the stage.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.540]   Would y'all give it up for my good friend Brenna Blain.
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.700]   [audience applauding]
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   [audience cheering]
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:01.220]   This is my third time in Texas.
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.300]   And something about me, yeah, that's a good thing.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.860]   Something about me is that when I get really excited
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.860]   about something, I tend to assimilate to the culture
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.420]   a little bit much.
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.140]   And so the last time I was in Dallas,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.380]   I went to Tyler Kingston Mercantile
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.020]   and bought out almost the entire store.
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.900]   I got this shirt that said Texas on it.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.580]   I got a bandana.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.220]   And for the next six months, I would wear cutoff jeans.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.660]   I'd wear my Texas shirt and my bandana
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.060]   when I would go preach places.
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.180]   And it started to happen that people would be like,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.180]   oh, Texas shirt, are you from Texas?
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.540]   And I'd go, well, not technically.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.660]   'Cause I was just so in love.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.660]   And I think I come by this enthusiastic love
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.900]   and adoption of adoration for places
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.380]   because something about my mom,
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.180]   I think that my siblings would also agree with
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.580]   is that if there's something that she loves,
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.340]   not only does she go all in on it,
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.420]   but she wants us to love it too.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.420]   And I think that's maybe how me and all my siblings
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.300]   ended up in musical theater.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.720]   But, oh, okay, musical theater, yeah.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.580]   But my mom would sometimes try to convince us
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.420]   that we loved the same things she did
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.920]   in ways that I think she thought were incredibly subtle,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.940]   but that really were not.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.540]   I remember my mom had this fictional author
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.580]   that she just loved.
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.340]   And I would walk into my mom's room at night
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.460]   and she'd be laying in bed with just tears
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.180]   streaming down her face.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.700]   And I'd be like, mom, what's wrong?
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.060]   And she'd be like, it's this book.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.740]   And I'm like, what the heck?
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.900]   And one of the books that my mom read,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.420]   I think she read it several times.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.620]   When I got a little bit older, she started to say,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.300]   hey, Brenna, I think you'd really love this book.
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.220]   And I'd say, no.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.680]   And then go to bed.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.580]   And I'd be sleeping and I'd wake up
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.300]   and I'd have this pain in my back.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.300]   And I'd be like, what the heck is that?
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.100]   And I found the book in my bed one night.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.300]   My mom snuck it into my bed.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.980]   And I didn't think much about this book.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.040]   It was some Christian romance type book.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.100]   And I remember my mom would say,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.660]   it's based off the book of Hosea.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.540]   And I thought, yeah, never read it.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.580]   And somehow I escaped not only four years
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.300]   of not reading that book,
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.000]   but also four years of high school,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.080]   not really even reading the Bible.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.960]   And certainly not the prophets,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.840]   because I had this perception that one,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.140]   they were incredibly boring.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.140]   And two, they had nothing to offer me.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.140]   And then the book of Hosea completely changed my life.
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.040]   So let's read today.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.960]   When the Lord began to speak through Hosea,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.880]   the Lord said to him, go, marry a promiscuous woman
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.360]   and have children with her.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.320]   For like an adulterous wife,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.860]   this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.760]   So he married Gomer, daughter of Dibliam,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.320]   and she conceived and bore him a son.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   Then skipping to Hosea three, it says,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.760]   and the Lord said to me, go again,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.480]   love a woman who is loved by another man
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.240]   and is an adulteress.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.040]   Even as the Lord loves the children of Israel,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.060]   though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.940]   So I bought her for 15 shekels of silver
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.000]   and a homer and a lecheth of barley.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.440]   And I said to her, you must dwell as mine for many days.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.560]   You shall not play the whore or belong to another man.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.880]   So will I also be to you.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.660]   For the children of Israel shall dwell many days
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.620]   without king or prince, without sacrifice or pillar,
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.600]   without ephod or household gods.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   After the children of Israel shall return
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.440]   and seek the Lord their God and David their king,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.480]   and they shall come in fear to the Lord
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.600]   and his goodness in the later days.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   So for context, the book of Hosea is an interesting one
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.760]   because there is so much meaning
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.860]   packed into just six and a half pages
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.580]   that make up the book in our modern Bibles.
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.420]   But with all things in the word,
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.260]   it is important that we look at it
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.540]   with the understanding that all of it matters.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.020]   All of it matters.
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.240]   Every single paragraph down to the words
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.140]   that were God breathed and not just written
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.540]   to the people living in that specific time period,
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.980]   but were also given for us.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.080]   Another thing that makes Hosea interesting
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.420]   is that there is not just an abundance of poetic forms
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.340]   like many of the prophets we see in the Bible,
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:18.500]   but it holds a narrative about Hosea himself
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.080]   that is intertwined within the pages
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.480]   of his prophecy to Israel.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.680]   You see, God did not just say to Hosea,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   here's your calling, I'm going to use your words,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.100]   but he said, here's your calling,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.260]   and I'm going to use your life.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:48.140]   You guys have been focusing on a topic of discipleship,
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.160]   the submission of your lives
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.400]   to the creator God of the universe
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.920]   because you see and know that he is trustworthy.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.980]   But the reality is that some of you are here
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.340]   and you don't buy that.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.140]   Maybe a friend has been dragging you along
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.760]   or maybe you're here because some feeling
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.260]   has been nagging you because you grew up in the Bible belt
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.060]   and this is just what good people do.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.560]   And so either out of shame or guilt
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.380]   or strange obligation, you are here.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.080]   But if you had it your way, you would be someplace else.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.980]   Or maybe you're here as someone who shouldn't be.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.620]   You got the courage to walk through the doors
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.040]   and you think to yourself,
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.940]   if anyone knew what my actual life was like,
[00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.540]   I would be unwelcomed.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.700]   If anyone knew that I'm actually a sex worker,
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.240]   if anyone knew, sure, I'm involved with serving,
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.980]   but I blow all my money on OnlyFans.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.620]   If anyone knew that I'm actually transgender,
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.740]   if anyone actually knew the hatred I feel
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.960]   for certain groups of people.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.900]   And so you hear the scripture being read
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.100]   and you zone out
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.500]   because it's not interesting or relevant to you.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.460]   Or you read Hosea and there is an ache in your heart
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.340]   because you don't identify with Hosea.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.080]   You don't identify with God.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.800]   You don't look at these faithful leaders
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.960]   and see yourself.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:42.860]   Instead, you see the unfaithfulness and the brokenness
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.660]   and the humanity of your life.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.880]   And you say, that's me.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.960]   I'm too far gone.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.800]   I'm too disobedient.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   I'm too uninterested in Jesus
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.340]   to even have a space at the table.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.600]   And even just being here in this room today
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.120]   is starting to feel uncomfortable to you.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.720]   And you're just trying to honor whoever invited you
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.060]   or the curiosity that brought you through those doors.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:24.800]   But I believe, and I've been tuning in the last few weeks
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.380]   and just watching and listening and praying.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.040]   I believe God is doing something in this space.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.720]   And we have to press into what that is.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.960]   Because the reality is, if you don't care,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.420]   if your heart is running,
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.300]   if you are uninterested in this entire night,
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.220]   it's not going to mean anything to you.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.980]   But before we let that happen,
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.060]   I believe God is wanting to say,
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.140]   awake, oh sleeper,
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:01.760]   I have something for you.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.640]   I don't know what that is.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.780]   It's not a secret, but I am not wildly prophetic.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.860]   So you will have to lean into what the Holy Spirit
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.180]   is doing in your heart tonight.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.720]   But as you hear these words, as you hear scripture,
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.080]   I'll just want to say to you now,
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:32.120]   pay attention to what you feel
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.800]   the Holy Spirit is doing in your heart.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.160]   Because what are the odds?
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.880]   What are the odds that you're feeling something
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.240]   just now, subtly stirring,
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.020]   and maybe I said something out loud
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.220]   that identified you in a church building
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.260]   for the first time in your entire life.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.320]   And you're trying to figure out how to leave.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.520]   Or you're trying to figure out
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.460]   if I'm going to close my computer and walk away.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.400]   Don't.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.600]   First, before you leave,
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.960]   can I just tell you about a time
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.560]   that I desperately wanted to leave?
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.940]   I had grown up in the Christian church,
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.600]   but after being abused at a young age,
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.680]   I really started to wrestle with things
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.080]   that felt unsafe for Christians to wrestle with.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.560]   I was depressed and suicidal
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.820]   by the time I was a freshman in high school,
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.520]   while also wrestling with my sexuality.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.320]   And I lived life often looking over my shoulder
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.820]   as if to say, "God, are you even there?
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.960]   "Do you even see me, or is all of this
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.140]   "that I've experienced just made up?"
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.600]   And I was nervous to tell my parents
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.820]   that I had deep doubt.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.440]   So I never wanted to say, "I don't want to go to church,"
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.680]   but I think my parents knew I was wrestling with a lot.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.100]   And so at the end of eighth grade, they said,
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.660]   "Hey, we would like for you to be in church,
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.780]   "but it doesn't have to be our church.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.200]   "So if you just find a place,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.840]   "we'd love for you to go there."
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.080]   And somehow I found a youth group
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.920]   that was like the dream for me.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.520]   No one there talked about sports.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.600]   Sorry, Texas.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.000]   Almost everyone there listened to alternative music,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.440]   and someone knew that I could play a few instruments.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.260]   And so not even after one week of going,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.560]   I got asked to join the worship team.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.840]   And even though singing songs to a God
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.080]   I wasn't sure was even there felt odd,
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.160]   it was so much better to me
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.600]   that I had something to do during worship
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.120]   that I got to focus on playing an instrument
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.960]   than have to sit through and actually think
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.280]   and contemplate what worship even was.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.440]   Because worship had this overwhelming effect on me.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.920]   When I would have to sit there,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.960]   I would see these people around me
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.480]   singing words of adoration and affection
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.360]   and praise to a God who had let me be abused,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.400]   who had let me get to the place
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.140]   where I no longer wanted to live.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.120]   And it was like everyone around me was in on something,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.900]   was experiencing a God I never knew without me.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.820]   And I would just want to scream.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.600]   And that continued for all four years
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.800]   of my time in high school.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:49.160]   And I had moments where I'd say to God,
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.680]   "Okay, maybe you are real.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.240]   "Maybe you do care.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.080]   "So I'm going to give you this.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.180]   "This square inch of my life, you're welcome.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.080]   "But you can't have any of this."
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.720]   And I would gather it all up in my arms,
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.480]   my depression, my anger, my self-image, my doubt,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.520]   and I would run to every other thing this world
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.600]   and would say, "Do you think you could heal me?
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:26.040]   "Do you think you could make me better?"
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.240]   So by the time I was 18,
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   I had a lot of practice avoiding God.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.520]   And I was at the age where I needed to decide
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.860]   what I was going to do next after graduation.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.080]   So I did what any other person running from God would do.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.820]   And I decided I would become a missionary.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.680]   And I thought I was being clever.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.960]   Like, "God, I'm going to hide from you
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.400]   "right under your nose and you will never find me."
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.720]   But you see, the truth was I hated school
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.000]   and I did not want to go to college, but I loved Hawaii.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.680]   I wanted to smoke weed, date hot women, and surf.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.020]   So I signed up to do six months with a missions group
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.800]   with the expectation that everyone else there
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.120]   would be just like me,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.680]   not really bought into this idea of God
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.600]   wanting to do some traveling and just get away.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.460]   And a lot of people there were just like me.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.640]   I don't know if we all collectively thought
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   we were tricking our parents or our youth pastors or what,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.740]   but at least a handful of us thought we ran so far
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.360]   and so fast from God that he would never catch up.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.400]   So the third morning, I am there,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.380]   and we're still in this like preliminary free time zone
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.720]   where you could kind of do whatever you wanted to do
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.320]   the first few days.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.440]   And I just wanted to be at the beach,
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.040]   but I had no car and hitchhiking out of town was difficult.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.680]   And so when they announced that they were going to take
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.020]   some vans into town for the morning for worship,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.440]   I thought, that's it.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.320]   I got a ride.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.520]   I'll just BS my way through this worship time.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.520]   So at least I seem respectful and then I'll hit the beach.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.940]   So we get to this place where we're going to have worship
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.960]   and I book it to the back of the room.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.300]   And I'm like, this is going to be so weird.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.660]   I'll just close my eyes and be back here
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.000]   and I'll get through it and I'll leave.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And I had grown up not really knowing the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.440]   And I thought this missions group was like Baptist,
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.020]   but it wasn't.
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:04.040]   So my eyes are closed and we're singing some song
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.000]   that everyone knows because it was written in 2007.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.060]   And I know music well because I'd been on worship team
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.360]   at that point for seven years.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.280]   And I know there's an instrumental break coming up.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.420]   So I'm sitting there and all of a sudden
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.420]   the instrumental goes, but then people are still singing.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.840]   And I'm like, what the heck, who's taking a solo?
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.880]   And then more voices started to sing.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.700]   And then some people started talking
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:47.460]   and I'm thinking, what the heck is happening?
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.660]   And my eyes are still closed,
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.620]   but now I'm bothered by what's happening
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.380]   because it just seems disrespectful.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.940]   And you know how I shared about sitting in worship
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.020]   and just hating it in high school,
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.580]   but I opened my eyes and I see something
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.660]   I had never seen before in my life.
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.420]   I see this girl standing there like this,
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:20.460]   just singing her own song, her own words, just worshiping.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.620]   And then I start to look around the room
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.620]   and I see people praying for people out loud.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:35.940]   And I'm thinking, this is weird.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.020]   And then the girl who's standing over here like this,
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.700]   she goes, yes Lord.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:49.440]   And I don't know how or what it was,
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.060]   but I remember how every time I had to sit through worship,
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.700]   I just wanted to scream.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.940]   And now here's this girl embodying all these negative things
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.780]   that had been pent up inside of me,
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.780]   but in a positive way in her worship and I lost it.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:18.060]   I had never seen someone worship
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.920]   with their entire being before.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:27.060]   And in that moment, I prayed a prayer
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.580]   I wasn't sure God would even hear.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.780]   I said, God, if you are real,
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:42.620]   if you care for me, if you see me,
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:48.700]   I want you to let me know whatever it takes,
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:54.780]   because this is the most real thing
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.980]   I have ever seen in my life.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.980]   And if there's a chance that my angst
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:08.420]   and my anxiety and my anguish could be set aside
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.060]   and I could know you like that,
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:18.340]   I want you to do whatever it takes to get me to that place.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.700]   And I think the unsaved person in me says,
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.620]   no, you shouldn't have prayed that prayer.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:28.260]   For the next entire month of being in this environment,
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.580]   it's like I'm watching a movie unfold.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.300]   There were 32 students in my school.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.860]   So 31, not including myself.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.260]   And it was like every single day,
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.740]   someone else who was living a life much like mine,
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.300]   suspicious of God at best, just completely melted.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.100]   I don't know what it was or why it was happening,
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.220]   but these people who looked like different versions of me
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:03.220]   were starting to confess, I am in love with God.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.140]   And I was living with these people.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.020]   So it wasn't just their words that were changing,
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.980]   it was their lives, their personalities, their character,
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.220]   the way that they interacted with people.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.140]   They were really truly being changed by God.
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.340]   And during that entire month,
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.820]   I went through almost every prayer
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.940]   and worship session like this.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:36.740]   And the more this happened for other people,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.620]   and the more I saw people change,
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.940]   the more conversations I had with myself that said, no,
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:48.380]   this isn't gonna happen for me.
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.020]   I don't know what they're on, but I don't buy it.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.860]   But I had a problem
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.300]   because we were supposed to do Christian things,
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.220]   because we were missionaries.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.540]   And one of the things we had to do
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.060]   was prepare and preach a 10 minute chapel talk.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.180]   And I signed up for the very last date possible
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.260]   on the calendar because I didn't want to do it.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.420]   And by the end of the month,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.260]   I had just a few days left until I was supposed to teach
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.260]   and I couldn't think of anything.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.980]   I tried doing that thing where you sit there
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.340]   with your Bible and you open to a random page.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.820]   And I was like, okay, God,
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.460]   whatever you want me to speak on, show me now.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.860]   And every time, every time I opened it, it was Leviticus.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.140]   And I was like, I can't do that.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:46.940]   And then one day, something reminded me of that book.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.260]   That my mom was always trying to get me to read.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:57.460]   And I thought, if some lady can get an entire book
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.260]   out of it, maybe I can get 10 minutes.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.940]   So I flipped to Hosea and I start reading.
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:10.620]   When the Lord began to speak through Hosea,
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.340]   the Lord said to him, go, marry a promiscuous woman
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.700]   and have children with her for like an adulterous wife,
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.700]   this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the Lord.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.300]   So he married Gomer, daughter of Diblium,
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.860]   and she conceived and bore him a son.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.860]   And I closed my Bible and I walked away.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.420]   And for the next 24 hours, all I heard was,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.260]   that's you, that's you, that's you.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.260]   Here are all these people who have been faithful,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.300]   who have never struggled with doubt
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.340]   and never wanted to die and never questioned God's plan.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.340]   And then there's you, like an adulterous woman
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.900]   towards God.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.340]   And I can't stop thinking about that.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.980]   And I don't know if people could tell if I was just down
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.340]   or if something was wrong,
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.060]   but I like to think it was the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.700]   But I was sitting on the bathroom floor
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.060]   just having a little bit of a meltdown.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.380]   Because not only were people around me experiencing God,
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.220]   I felt like I had, God, I felt like I'd never even known,
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.860]   but now I was aware of how deeply unfaithful
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   I had been towards God in the first place.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.900]   Like why would God ever even want to change me
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:52.220]   if I never acted like I ever even really wanted Him?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:59.860]   And as I'm sitting on the floor, I hear footsteps
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.820]   and they're angry and they're coming in fast
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.660]   in my direction.
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.300]   And I panicked 'cause I wasn't supposed
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.660]   to be in this bathroom.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.900]   But the door flies open.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.580]   And before I'm able to say anything or do anything,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:20.580]   I see this student, a girl I had met on the plane
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.500]   on my way to this missions group
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.940]   who had the complete opposite personality of me.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.940]   She was joyful and she was loud and she loved everyone
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:37.060]   and she wanted to hug everyone and she woke up happy.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:43.060]   And she's standing at the door and I'm thinking, why you?
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:48.380]   And she looks at me dead in the eye
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.380]   with some frustration in her face.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:58.500]   And she yells, you are worth it.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.380]   You are worth it.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:15.180]   Now go finish reading whatever God has asked you to read.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.540]   And then she leaves.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:25.700]   And I deeply confused because again, I'm not charismatic,
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:30.700]   wonder back to my room and I open up my Bible back to Hosea
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.980]   and I start reading again where I left off.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.900]   And I finally get to chapter three.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:45.100]   It says, the Lord said to me, go again.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:52.380]   Love a woman who is loved by another man
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:57.380]   and is an adulteress even as the Lord loves
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.500]   the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.420]   and love cakes of raisins.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.420]   So I bought her for 15 shekels of silver
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.580]   and a Homer and a lake chest of barley.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.580]   And I said to her, you must dwell as mine.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.020]   For many days you shall not play the whore
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:24.020]   or belong to another man still, so will I also be to you.
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:29.380]   For the children of Israel shall dwell many days
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.100]   without king or prince, without sacrifice
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.220]   or pillar without ephod or household gods.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.220]   Afterward, the children of Israel shall return
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:46.580]   and seek the Lord their God and David their king.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:52.180]   And they shall come in fear to the Lord
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.900]   and to his goodness in the latter days.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:03.700]   And as I read these words, I began to weep.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:10.740]   And I feel as if the Holy Spirit says,
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.740]   if that's you, who am I?
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:22.100]   In this story, if you are the woman,
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:26.780]   if you are like Israel, then who am I?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.340]   And as I said earlier, there is so much depth
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.060]   packed into this book that not just every sentence
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.400]   but every word means something.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.380]   And the literal meaning of the name Hosea,
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:46.380]   the root of that name means to save, to deliver.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:56.900]   Here is a woman who has said to Hosea, I'm yours.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.940]   I'm here.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.220]   And Hosea, knowing her promise would be faulty
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:06.900]   still enters into a covenant relationship with her.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.620]   Much like God has willingly entered
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.620]   a covenant relationship with us, an unfaithful people.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:24.540]   And much like us, so much like me.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.100]   After time not feeling like I was getting
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.300]   what I thought I ought to get from God,
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.340]   this woman leaves her husband and goes into town
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.980]   with the mission of unfaithfulness,
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.980]   probably hoping something else would meet her needs,
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:46.260]   would make her happy, would give her what she felt
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.860]   like she desperately needed.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.060]   All the while she must also wonder
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:57.060]   does he even see me?
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.580]   Does he care that I've gone?
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:09.060]   Such a mix of unhealthy but real feelings
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:17.900]   so many of us have felt about the God of the universe.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.580]   I don't care, but does he?
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:30.140]   I don't want to be faithful, will he?
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:37.540]   And the reality is this is far after Deuteronomy takes place
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.540]   so Hosea could have rightfully said, I want a divorce.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.260]   And that probably was something on both of their minds
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.460]   but God speaks to Hosea and says, go again,
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.740]   love a woman who is loved by another man
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.820]   and is an adulteress even as the Lord loves
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:01.340]   the children of Israel though they turn to other gods.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.540]   Though they turn to other gods, go and love her again.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.140]   You see, some of you in here know the pain,
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.380]   the real pain that unfaithfulness causes
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.820]   in the midst of a covenant relationship.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.260]   And so hearing this part of the story feels unfathomable.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:27.860]   And even more so is that a God who has never sinned
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.140]   against us has the soul right to walk away
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.980]   and yet watch what he does.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:41.500]   Hosea tells us, so I bought her.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.460]   This gives us insight into the view of woman
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.420]   at this time.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.340]   By many cultures, women were seen as property
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.100]   but not by God.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:01.660]   The interesting thing was because Hosea already married her,
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.260]   she would have been seen as his.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.660]   He literally could have gone into town and said,
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:13.380]   this is mine and taken her back home.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:19.740]   But he wants to make something abundantly clear to her
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:25.180]   in the language and the action of this time.
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:30.460]   He wants her to know you are worth it.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.780]   So he sacrifices.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:40.860]   As we read this, are you able to see the story
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.460]   within the story?
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.940]   The narrative of Hosea is not just a beautiful story
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.860]   of faithfulness, it is a foreshadowing
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.660]   of Christ on the cross.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.100]   We being God's creation, we are his to begin with.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:03.540]   And yet God has given us agency to make the choices we make.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.740]   If we want to be unfaithful,
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.620]   he doesn't keep us locked up as his property
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.340]   but allows us to leave.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   And yet, even after we have left,
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:24.340]   he pursues us.
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   Not in anger, not as a tyrant,
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.540]   not even as the owner of our souls,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.900]   even though he could with the snap of his fingers
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.620]   demand that we come home.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   He chose to come after us in an act of sacrifice
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.700]   to buy what was already his.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.420]   God sends his son to die in our place
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.140]   and through that, through that very action,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.300]   we become worth it.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:09.180]   If we are Gomer and if we are Israel,
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.580]   God is our faithful savior.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:18.340]   And it was in that moment when I looked back
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.020]   over every single thing that had happened in my life,
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.140]   every time I ran from God,
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.100]   every time I felt like he left me alone,
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.580]   every time I wondered if he saw me
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   and I realized I have been relentlessly pursued.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:42.780]   You have been relentlessly pursued.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.380]   It doesn't matter what you've done.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.580]   It doesn't matter how far you have gone.
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.220]   It doesn't matter the things you have said
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:02.500]   because the one, the only one who is faithful
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:06.340]   is the one who has bought you for a price
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.980]   and named you and called you and brought you here.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:18.380]   I know the reality is that some of you are hearing this
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.700]   and you're thinking, yeah, that's great for other people,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.980]   but not me.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:30.700]   And I have to say, if you're feeling that
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.260]   or you're thinking that
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.980]   and you're hearing this,
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.100]   might this be a grand gesture
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.740]   of God's relentless pursuit towards you?
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:50.100]   I think God wants to meet with you
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.820]   and I hope and I think
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:59.340]   that he's using this right now
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.060]   as the girl who burst through the door saying,
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.380]   you are worth it.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:12.860]   Because think about what are the chances actually
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:19.100]   that you're in this room hearing this right now?
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.140]   And that God said to me,
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:26.340]   this is the message that I want you to share
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.300]   for that person.
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.620]   Maybe you're thinking that I'm unfaithful.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.460]   Yes.
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:42.300]   I have been hurt by others and I have hurt others.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:43.140]   Yes.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.340]   I am constantly running away.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.420]   Yes.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:53.980]   But what is the picture that God has painted for us?
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.340]   It's this.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.380]   Whether it is the idolatry of the Israelites
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.260]   or the adultery of Gomorrah,
[00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:08.260]   our hearts sinful condition is to wander far from God.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:16.260]   But God's promise to us we find in Hosea 2, 19 through 20.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.140]   It says,
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:27.740]   and I will betroth you to me forever.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.740]   I will betroth you to me in righteousness and in justice,
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.100]   in steadfast love and in mercy.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.100]   I will betroth you to me in faithfulness
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.700]   and you shall know the Lord.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:50.700]   His promise to us is his love, his compassion
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.620]   and most significantly his faithfulness.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.620]   And with that by no feat of our own strength,
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.500]   but only through his sacrifice,
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:06.500]   he declares us worthy of being brought home.
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:11.460]   So how should we respond?
[00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:19.140]   If you have not made the choice
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.860]   to willingly go back home with God,
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.860]   why not now?
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.380]   Why not tonight?
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.940]   And if you have made that choice,
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:43.140]   would you let today be a deeply joyful reminder
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.820]   to look back and to celebrate God's faithfulness to you?
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.700]   Some of you, I was praying for our time.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.820]   I'm gonna go off script a little bit.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.060]   I was praying for our time coming up
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.500]   and I couldn't picture the room
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   because I've never been in a room this big before.
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.300]   And so I felt like the Lord just started showing me faces
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.100]   and asking me to pray.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.740]   And as I was praying, I just felt like the Lord said,
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.980]   "Some of the people here,
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:20.980]   "your inclination has been not to sing during worship
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:27.100]   "because God doesn't feel good.
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.180]   "He doesn't feel close.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.620]   "He doesn't feel loving.
[00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.980]   "He doesn't feel caring."
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:36.460]   I've been there.
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:42.540]   But this last year I read through the Psalms
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.940]   and I always thought the Psalmists were bad songwriters
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.540]   'cause they repeat themselves over and over and over again.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.380]   But what I come to realize as I read through this last year
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.300]   that they don't repeat themselves
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.660]   because they're bad songwriters.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.340]   They repeat themselves because their hearts are fickle
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.780]   and they need the reminder of God's character
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:08.100]   in their life that it is unchanging.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:16.820]   Some of you need that reminding so desperately.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.660]   If you made the choice tonight, I'm gonna do something.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.780]   I want everyone to stand up really quick.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:30.780]   If you made the choice to willingly go with God,
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.300]   and I need to say this,
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.900]   I know we are in the Bible belt
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.180]   and I know I'm asking you to do something deeply vulnerable,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.100]   but I wanna say you are in community.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:47.100]   You are in the context of a place where you are not alone.
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.980]   You are in the context of a place
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.380]   with people who care deeply for you.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.700]   They want healing and rescue for you.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.220]   They want you to do life in community.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.820]   They don't want you to do it alone.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.700]   So if you have been wrestling and tonight you either decided
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.300]   I'm going to go back home, it feels scary.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.420]   It feels overwhelming, but I'm ready.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.420]   I'm ready to go back home.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.420]   Or if you're sitting here going,
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.860]   if I wanna go back home,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:24.540]   I'm just gonna ask you to sit where you're at.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:30.460]   And if you're comfortable with the people around you
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.900]   placing their hands on you or just extending a hand
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.700]   so we can pray for you.
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:41.900]   But I wanna read our inheritance over us tonight
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.540]   because I want you to be so aware
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:52.060]   of what the Lord has done.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.900]   Would you just close your eyes?
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:04.180]   Psalm 23 says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.660]   I shall not want.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:12.460]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.540]   He leads me besides still waters.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.220]   He restores my soul.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:26.340]   He leads me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:30.020]   Even though I walk through the valley
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.940]   of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:40.100]   For you are with me, your rod and your staff,
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.380]   they comfort me.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:46.380]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.820]   and you anoint my head with oil.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.340]   My cup overflows.
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:57.220]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.660]   all the days of my life.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.740]   And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.180]   God, I just ask that you would be in this room
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.180]   and fill in the gaps that I missed.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.700]   Lord, the ways that I stumbled, you are sufficient.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.220]   You know what is going on in this room tonight.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.220]   You know what is happening.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.860]   You know what's stirring in the hearts of those
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.620]   in this place, God.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.260]   For those who have wandered far off from you,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.580]   for those who feel like it's too late
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.860]   or for those who feel apathetic,
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:42.820]   would you remind them of your deep love for them?
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:49.300]   God, I thank you for what you are doing in this room.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.380]   Would you just continue to move
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.580]   as we sing in faithfulness, amen.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.080]   (music fades)
