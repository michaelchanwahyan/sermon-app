1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,580
 (upbeat music)

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:25,600
 - Oh man, oh man, it's great to be back with you.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,480
 It was an awesome break, lots of fun,

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,640
 but really good to be back in a place

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,000
 where I get to have a front row seat

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,840
 of watching God move through 20 and 30 somethings

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,800
 to change this world for the name of Jesus,

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,840
 making him famous.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,160
 If you're a guest with us today,

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,760
 we're so glad that you're here.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,660
 We just wanna invite you into our home.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,760
 Make it your home, make yourself at home.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,480
 If we can serve you in any way we want to.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,000
 My wife and I, Monica, we just got back over the break.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,740
 We got to go to the Dominican Republic

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,040
 because a friend of ours, a close friend of ours

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,640
 got married and so we went to his wedding.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,160
 I actually had the honor to do his wedding

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,440
 and he and his wife's wedding, who's also a friend of ours.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,320
 We got to go with some mutual friends, so that's fun.

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,960
 I don't know if you've ever been to the Dominican.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
 It's a beautiful place, gorgeous beaches.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,600
 It's an island nation, shares an island with Haiti,

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,000
 which we go to here at the porch.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,700
 And so just there, just enjoying it

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,900
 and kind of soaking it in.

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,480
 And so what was my favorite part really of being there

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,640
 is being there with close friends.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,920
 And so the Crooks has went, Greg and his wife, Alicia,

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,480
 who's a close friend of ours.

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,720
 Greg and I worked together here

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,160
 and then Ryan and Allie Wall went

34
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,600
 and they're both on the young adult team.

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,680
 And then the Shanes went and so Shane Everett and his wife

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,840
 and then Shane B and his wife, Beth,

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,000
 who you just got to hear from.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And so we all got to share this house,

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,160
 this five bedroom house in the Dominican Republic.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,040
 It was amazing.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,520
 So think about like a house with five master suites

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,640
 and had this lady who every morning,

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,280
 who was also there every morning, we'd wake up

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,360
 and she's like cooking breakfast

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,120
 and there's a swimming pool and a hot tub.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,080
 And it was ridiculous.

47
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,000
 It was like we were living a dream.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
 But I learned something about myself

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,720
 in sharing this house with four other couples

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,160
 is I really suffer from FOMO, all right?

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
 The fear of missing out.

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,080
 I have a problem with it.

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,560
 Every single day, right, I'm waking up

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,480
 and I'm wondering what's going on downstairs.

55
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,260
 I get out of bed and there was like this balcony

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,560
 that opened to the living room, you know,

57
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
 off of our master bedroom upstairs.

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,360
 And so I'd wake up and I'd kind of peek out the door

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
 to see if somebody's up.

60
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,520
 Okay, are they up?

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,680
 Okay, no, I can go back to sleep, all right.

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
 And I wake up like 15 minutes later,

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,600
 like okay, you up yet, right?

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,920
 'Cause you don't know what you're missing out on, right?

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,040
 Shane B's probably down there

66
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,760
 writing some amazing song with Beth

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,320
 and I could be missing out on that.

68
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
 I mean, I wouldn't be down there writing a song

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,360
 and Greg's down there, he's probably adding some lyrics to it.

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,780
 He's gonna get recognition on the album

71
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,160
 and so I'm like hey, I wanna be down there, right?

72
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,440
 And I got FOMO-phobia kicking in, right?

73
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,760
 I'm FOMO-phobic evidently.

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,440
 And so then we go down there

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
 and there's these golf carts

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,120
 that you can ride around the island at the house.

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,440
 It's heaven, it's amazing.

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,500
 And so then I'm like hey, where's the big golf cart?

79
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,760
 Where's everybody at?

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,040
 They're like oh, Shane E and some of the guys,

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,940
 they went and got sushi at the marina.

82
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,720
 I'm like man, I like sushi.

83
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,680
 Nobody wanted to ask me if I wanted some sushi, you know?

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
 Like what's up?

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
 I'm like what am I supposed to eat here?

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,660
 Peanut butter and jelly?

87
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,500
 They're having sushi?

88
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,560
 I got no golf cart?

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
 I mean it's the worst thing in the world, right?

90
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,700
 To be left behind with no golf cart.

91
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,320
 And then it would really show up at night.

92
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,120
 At night we'd be sitting around the hot tub

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,320
 and we'd be talking in these deep conversations

94
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,880
 and I'm sitting there and I can't hold my eyes open.

95
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,720
 I'm like so tired after the day, being in the sun.

96
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,760
 Man, I gotta go to bed.

97
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,000
 But you can't go to bed.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,740
 What am I, I'm gonna miss out on the conversations.

99
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,160
 You know, who knows what's gonna happen if I go to bed.

100
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,940
 They're gonna get in some deep theological conversation.

101
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,860
 They're gonna need me there to clean that up, right?

102
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,820
 And so I'm like I can't go to bed.

103
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,860
 And so I'm sitting there and I'm like okay.

104
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,580
 And then somebody will say like,

105
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,740
 hey man, I think I'm gonna go to bed.

106
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,260
 And I'm like hey, you know what guys, that's a good idea.

107
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,680
 We should all go to bed.

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,980
 We need to get some good shut eye.

109
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,540
 We got a big day tomorrow.

110
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,380
 You know, let's go to bed.

111
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,620
 And I realized about myself being with these other couples

112
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,620
 is like man, I'm constantly concerned

113
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,620
 that I'm gonna miss out on something when I was with them.

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,740
 And it gets worse, right?

115
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,520
 This is a new phenomenon that they're doing

116
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,100
 all these professional studies on and academic studies on.

117
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,080
 Then it gets worse when you look at social media.

118
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,920
 Hey, have you ever done this?

119
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,300
 Like you get home and you had an amazing day.

120
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,740
 Like everything went well.

121
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,280
 Sun's shining, birds chirping, boss loves you.

122
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,220
 And you get home, you're like man, my life is amazing.

123
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,820
 And then you get on Instagram and you're like

124
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,900
 how come she's always at Nick and Sam's?

125
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,160
 I mean like she's always eating there.

126
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,740
 Like does she know Nick and Sam?

127
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,820
 I mean what's going on?

128
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,020
 How come I never get to eat at Nick and Sam's?

129
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,020
 You know, and it's like is he ever not on a boat?

130
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,740
 And why didn't he invite me to go on a boat?

131
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,340
 And how come everybody's having fun

132
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,420
 and then you go to Twitter and you just see more of the same

133
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,620
 and then you go to Facebook and you see this veneer

134
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,180
 of everyone's lives, it's just the highlight reels

135
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,640
 and suddenly you realize that your life sucks.

136
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,860
 And you're like what is going on?

137
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,300
 And after a great day, you're sad.

138
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,460
 Like man, I like Nick and Sam's, I like boats.

139
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,100
 Why am I here?

140
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,800
 Nobody called me, what's going on?

141
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,500
 And this is this phenomenon and it's not real.

142
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,980
 It's a facade.

143
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,100
 This stirs up something.

144
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,140
 They're saying it's linked to depression

145
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,780
 and it goes both ways.

146
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,620
 You're a victim of it but you also cause it.

147
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,860
 You know that when I was on that island,

148
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,300
 when I was in the Dominican, the sun was setting,

149
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,420
 the sky was on fire, the clouds were orange.

150
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,620
 I grabbed Monica, my bride, and I'm like hey, come on,

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,340
 and we get on the golf court and we're chasing the sunset

152
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,380
 and I've got my iPhone out and I realize

153
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,140
 that I'm not enjoying the sunset

154
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,840
 because I'm trying to take a picture

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,580
 so I can show you all the sunset on Instagram

156
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,860
 and I can't enjoy the picture in and of itself.

157
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,660
 It's just an opportunity really to make others jealous,

158
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,140
 to wish that they were where I was

159
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,740
 and you know you do it too so before you judge me,

160
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,220
 you know you're guilty, right?

161
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,300
 And we do this.

162
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,860
 We have gamified life.

163
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,540
 That's what we've done.

164
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
 We don't enjoy the moments in and of themselves.

165
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,020
 The moments in and of themselves are only opportunities

166
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,900
 to make others wish that they were enjoying

167
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,060
 the moments in and of themselves

168
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,500
 that we're not even enjoying

169
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,380
 and that's what it's come to

170
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,520
 and that's why we're starting 2015

171
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
 with this series called Missing Out.

172
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
 That's our hashtag if you want to use it

173
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
 if you're on social media and want to make others

174
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,520
 feel like they're missing out.

175
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
 Hashtag missing out.

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,080
 I'm not alone in this.

177
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,520
 Studies estimate that around 70% of all adults

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,480
 in developed countries suffer from the all-consuming feeling

179
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,080
 that something's happening and they're not a part of it.

180
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,440
 That comes from Boston Magazine, August 2014

181
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,240
 and so tonight, we're gonna talk specifically

182
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,660
 about missing out on purpose to start this series

183
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,860
 because I want to ask you, what if all of the moments

184
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,340
 that you have collectively experienced

185
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,980
 were not the right moments?

186
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,500
 In fact, you missed out on your purpose in those moments.

187
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,340
 Let me say this.

188
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,960
 What if you get to the end of this life

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,100
 and you stand before God, here I am,

190
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,640
 and you look back and there's the account of your life

191
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,240
 and your stuff and your pictures and your moments

192
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,560
 and your relationships and you realize

193
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,120
 you missed out on your purpose?

194
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,880
 And the essence of being human is wanting to know

195
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,960
 why we're here and what we're here for,

196
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,600
 finding our purpose and I'm gonna tell you that tonight

197
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,920
 from the scriptures, God, the creator of the heavens

198
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,240
 and the earth, his Holy Spirit is going to make known to us

199
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,400
 the things of him and I pray that you would leave here

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
 with great clarity on what your purpose is.

201
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,840
 You're gonna leave here this evening knowing

202
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,360
 beyond a shadow of a doubt what your purpose is,

203
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,320
 why you are alive.

204
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,400
 I've said it before, I'll say it again.

205
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,080
 I believe that the greatest tragedy for a person's life

206
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,760
 is if they miss out on their purpose.

207
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
 A buddy challenged me on that and said,

208
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,320
 wait a minute, what about cancer?

209
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,040
 Listen, you can find purpose in cancer

210
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,440
 but if you live your entire life

211
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,960
 and you've never found your purpose, why you're here,

212
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,440
 that is a tremendous tragedy for an individual.

213
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,600
 I don't wanna stand before God and him be like,

214
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,520
 hey, that's fine, you're here, that's great

215
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,480
 but you didn't live those moments

216
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,440
 for the reasons that I had you in them.

217
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,360
 You wasted them.

218
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,240
 You missed your purpose and so we're gonna talk about

219
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,800
 what it means to be made with purpose,

220
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,120
 what it looks like if we miss out on our purpose

221
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,800
 and before you leave here this evening, what our purpose is.

222
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,000
 And so I'll start with this idea.

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,480
 My first point is you were made on purpose.

224
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
 You were made on purpose.

225
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,160
 This is a profound reality.

226
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,600
 Let me hit you with this.

227
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,760
 All created beings have a purpose.

228
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,280
 Now you gotta decide right now in your heart and mind,

229
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
 do you believe that?

230
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,160
 All created things have a purpose.

231
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
 They were created by a creator for a purpose.

232
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,680
 Now you can say no because I could make something

233
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
 without a purpose.

234
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
 Well then its purpose would be to exist without a purpose.

235
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,600
 That would be its purpose.

236
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
 Now before you think about that too long, just trust me.

237
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
 I've thought a lot about it.

238
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 All created things were created for a purpose.

239
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,760
 Now we believe as you follow the Judeo-Christian narrative

240
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,800
 that we were created by a God, a creator.

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
 Now if you're here and you're atheist,

242
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,760
 here's my challenge with atheism

243
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,000
 or my problem with atheism is you have to assign a purpose

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
 and if you talk to a room full of atheists

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,020
 and you say hey what is our purpose?

246
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,180
 They're going to come up with different things.

247
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,720
 They're gonna say well to further the human race

248
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,120
 or to make the world a better place

249
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,720
 or there is no purpose and we should all just destroy

250
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,560
 the world and die.

251
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
 I mean they're gonna disagree on that

252
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,280
 because they don't believe we were created.

253
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,360
 They believe that life just happened

254
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,560
 and therefore they cannot have a purpose.

255
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
 You were not created with a purpose

256
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,520
 so you have to assign one.

257
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,680
 But who gets to assign purpose?

258
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
 Who gets to assign purpose?

259
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,080
 Creator does.

260
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,460
 Creator does.

261
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,880
 Take an object for example, we'll go iPad.

262
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,600
 To my little girls, I've got two, Presley and Finley,

263
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,920
 the iPad is nothing more than a gaming device.

264
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,400
 To me it's a Bible and a method to check

265
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,560
 and respond to email.

266
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,160
 To you it might be a way to watch Netflix or something else

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,400
 but the iPad has a purpose who assigned its purpose

268
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,080
 its creator did.

269
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,140
 So hey this is what this is for.

270
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,720
 There's a video that went viral.

271
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,360
 It was actually a German commercial

272
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,400
 where you see this man and his daughter in the kitchen

273
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
 and they're kind of cooking food and she says,

274
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,220
 "Hey dad, did you like that iPad we got you

275
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,360
 "for your birthday?"

276
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,920
 And he says, "Yeah, it's fine."

277
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,000
 And then you see him chopping up vegetables on it,

278
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,520
 using it as a cutting board.

279
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,040
 And she just kind of, her jaw hits the floor

280
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,280
 and he walks over to the sink and scrapes the vegetables off

281
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,080
 and then runs water over the iPad,

282
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,680
 washing it off as a cutting board.

283
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,160
 And when you watch it, it's hard to watch.

284
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,380
 It's like, oh no, that's not what it's for.

285
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,100
 It's disturbing frankly.

286
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,620
 It's even more disturbing when you see someone

287
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,320
 living outside their purpose.

288
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
 Like no, no, no, no, that's not why you have life.

289
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,540
 That's not why there's breath in your lungs.

290
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,100
 That's not why your heart beats in your chest.

291
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,580
 That's not why God left you here.

292
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,280
 After he saved you, that's not why God created humanity.

293
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,560
 You see, everyone has a purpose

294
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,800
 and that purpose is determined by the creator.

295
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,840
 Steve Jobs determines the purpose of the iPad,

296
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,780
 or he did anyways.

297
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,840
 And so the creator, creator God, determines our purpose.

298
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,380
 He says this in Genesis one, I'm gonna be in Genesis

299
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,900
 and then Ecclesiastes 12.

300
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,880
 Verse 26, God said, "Let us,"

301
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,560
 that us is a reference to the Trinity,

302
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,400
 Father, Son, and Spirit.

303
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,920
 "Let us make mankind in our image,

304
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,440
 "in our likeness so that they may rule over the fish

305
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,040
 "and the sea and the birds and the sky,

306
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,680
 "over the livestock and all the wild animals

307
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,160
 "and over all the creatures that move along the ground."

308
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,720
 So God, creator, created mankind in his own image.

309
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,760
 In the image of God, he created them.

310
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,880
 Male and female, he created them.

311
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,720
 God, creator, blessed them and said to them,

312
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,200
 "Be fruitful and increase in number.

313
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,480
 "Fill the earth and subdue it.

314
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,160
 "Rule over the fish and the sea

315
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,300
 "and the birds and the sky

316
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,640
 "and over every living creature that moves on the ground."

317
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,440
 And so here we see the creator ascribing to us a purpose.

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
 And so if I was to put that in simple terms,

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
 he says you were made in his image to represent God.

320
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,560
 The New Testament version of that is to be an ambassador

321
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,100
 or a representative in a foreign land

322
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,960
 that you would, one, represent God,

323
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,820
 two, that you would multiply his people or his kind.

324
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,980
 The Old Testament is really a story

325
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,280
 of God preserving a remnant of his followers.

326
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,800
 And really blessing them so that other people

327
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,680
 would see them blessed and want to know him.

328
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,480
 In fact, at one point in the story,

329
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,080
 he just wipes out the entire world

330
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,320
 and preserves just a few of his followers on an ark.

331
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,080
 And then he has Jacob and then Israel and the Israelites.

332
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,240
 And he protects and preserves them

333
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,840
 through different nations, different countries,

334
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,800
 different peoples.

335
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,040
 He says, "These are my people."

336
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,560
 And now we exist as the remnant,

337
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,520
 as followers of Jesus Christ,

338
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,880
 representing God as he protects and preserves his followers.

339
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,680
 We are to multiply his kind, multiply our kind,

340
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,880
 his followers.

341
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,000
 And then lastly, to care for his things.

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,480
 So to represent God, multiply his people,

343
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
 and to care for his things.

344
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,600
 This really puts things into perspective.

345
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,480
 Here's why.

346
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,640
 Because all of you came in here with God-given desires.

347
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
 And those God-given desires

348
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
 targeted in the right direction

349
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,640
 can push you towards your purpose.

350
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,920
 Let me say that again.

351
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
 This is important.

352
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,960
 Your God-given desires,

353
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,320
 if understood correctly,

354
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,560
 if brought into the right perspective,

355
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,060
 can push you into his purpose.

356
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,800
 I'll illustrate it with a story that happened.

357
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
 This weekend I was speaking at Movement Day,

358
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
 or I was on a panel.

359
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,480
 Movement Day is like a local missions conference,

360
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,400
 Movement Day conference.

361
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,440
 And I was in the green room

362
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
 and I was talking to this young lady.

363
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,620
 She was very bright,

364
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,640
 loved Jesus, very kind.

365
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,080
 And we, that day, we had been downtown,

366
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,520
 David and Ryan and I,

367
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,360
 and we had been planning out

368
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,320
 the entire preaching calendar the entire year.

369
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,160
 And we were working on this epic dating series in the fall

370
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
 that we were really excited about,

371
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,960
 but we were trying to come up with a name for it.

372
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,180
 And so I gave her three options.

373
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,640
 And I said, "Hey, which one would you come to?"

374
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,520
 And she said, "Honestly?"

375
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,360
 And I said, "Yeah."

376
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,400
 She said, "None of them."

377
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,000
 So, "Okay, okay, why?"

378
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,560
 And she said, "Well, because I'm really about mission.

379
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,600
 "I'm really about being in the church.

380
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
 "I'm really about the great commission

381
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,560
 "and caring for the poor and dating.

382
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,600
 "I don't wanna go and hear about that."

383
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,160
 And doesn't that sound kind of noble,

384
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,040
 a little pious, maybe godly?

385
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,520
 Like, "Hey, I don't need to hear about dating.

386
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,960
 "I wanna hear about caring for the poor."

387
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,780
 That sounds godly.

388
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,620
 But I just asked her a question.

389
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,460
 I said, "Hey, do you know

390
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,160
 "what the first great commission was?"

391
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,420
 She said, "What?"

392
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,280
 I said, "To be fruitful and multiply."

393
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,380
 Do you see how that mission that you wanna carry out,

394
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,260
 that your God-given desires for a husband or dating,

395
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,700
 they're not bad.

396
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,720
 That is a method for you to carry out

397
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,960
 God's purpose in your life.

398
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,800
 And you say, "Well, wait a minute.

399
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,720
 "What if I don't get married?"

400
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,040
 You don't need to be married to multiply His kind,

401
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,200
 His discipleship.

402
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 You take the gospel that has been poured into you

403
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,160
 and you pour it and entrust it into others.

404
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,300
 You sit with others and you teach Him His ways.

405
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,900
 You say, "Hey, this is who God is."

406
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,520
 And you protect and preserve His name and our culture.

407
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,440
 And you build, redeem His kingdom,

408
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,760
 renew it here, even in Dallas.

409
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
 But your God-given desires for a husband

410
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,500
 or for children or for a wife,

411
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,240
 those are desires that can fit within His purpose.

412
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
 But those desires become corrupted

413
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,880
 when you make them in and of themselves your purpose.

414
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,120
 When you say, "Hey, what is your purpose

415
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,400
 "to find a husband?"

416
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,440
 Sounds desperate.

417
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,280
 And it doesn't play out well

418
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,140
 because it's a misdirection of your God-given desires.

419
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:54,220
 And so, if those desires become ultimate

420
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,500
 or they become about you,

421
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,620
 then you've missed the purpose that God has for them.

422
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,380
 And so, what does it look like to miss out on your purpose?

423
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,020
 That's the second point that I wanna cover

424
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,680
 is missing out on your purpose.

425
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,700
 And so, just plainly put, as simply as I can,

426
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,140
 you, one, don't represent God.

427
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,080
 You represent unredeemed humanity.

428
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,920
 You, two, you don't multiply the things of Him,

429
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,280
 you multiply the things of this world.

430
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,060
 You become a disciple of the world and you say,

431
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,140
 "Hey, others, follow me in my worldliness,

432
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,920
 "not my godliness."

433
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,960
 And three, you don't steward the things of God,

434
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
 you collect them for yourselves.

435
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,720
 You collect trinkets and treasures for yourselves.

436
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,360
 And so, the greatest example

437
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,220
 and where I wanna spend the rest of our time of this

438
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,420
 is on my friend King Solomon.

439
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,300
 One of my favorite series that we've taught here

440
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,340
 at The Porch was called Vanity, an Experiment

441
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,900
 and it was on the Book of Ecclesiastes.

442
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,820
 If you didn't, if you missed that,

443
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,300
 you can go on The Porch app and catch it

444
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,100
 or online or on iTunes and catch it.

445
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,220
 But it's so relevant to Dallas,

446
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,300
 that's why I tell you about it.

447
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,980
 And so, the Book of Ecclesiastes

448
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,860
 is really the wealthiest man in the world

449
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,220
 running an experiment of looking for purpose

450
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,540
 in anything and everything and everywhere.

451
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,700
 That's what he's doing.

452
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,240
 He's saying, "Hey, you don't have to, I've already done it.

453
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,700
 "And I'm bigger than you, I'm better than you,

454
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,960
 "I'm faster than you, I'm richer than you,

455
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,800
 "I'm better looking than you,

456
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,700
 "and I'm better dressed than you,

457
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,380
 "and I've got more wives than you, so trust me."

458
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,140
 And so, that's where we're at in Ecclesiastes.

459
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,340
 And so, Solomon begins this experiment

460
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,680
 and he looks for purpose in partying and socializing.

461
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,180
 But he was missing out on purpose.

462
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,740
 He had 15,000 people come over for dinner

463
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,620
 almost every night.

464
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,620
 He killed over 100,000 heads of livestock for some parties.

465
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,460
 Anybody here like wine?

466
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,500
 Don't raise your hand.

467
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,340
 (audience laughing)

468
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,300
 You're like, "Is that a test?"

469
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,340
 Shots of Patron.

470
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,180
 (audience laughing)

471
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,380
 You might like wine.

472
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,540
 He had vineyards.

473
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,700
 In fact, can I show you something

474
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,460
 I just pulled down from Google Earth yesterday?

475
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,580
 This is from Google Earth.

476
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,540
 I just went on there and took a screenshot.

477
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,660
 This is today, 2015.

478
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,860
 Those are called the Pools of Solomon.

479
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,700
 Okay, they're still there.

480
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,520
 They're stone.

481
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,780
 You can't really tell because we're so high up.

482
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,180
 They were made by stone.

483
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,180
 2015, 3,000 years after his existence, they're still there.

484
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,120
 You know what those pools were for?

485
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,340
 Those pools were to water his vineyards.

486
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,460
 They weren't even to swim in.

487
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,180
 I mean, they're giant reservoirs

488
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,740
 to water his great bushes and trees.

489
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,340
 All right, let me tell you why that's relevant

490
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,580
 because let's think of someone wealthy.

491
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,980
 We'll go with Donald Trump.

492
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,980
 3,000 years from now, Trump Towers is dust.

493
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,420
 3,000 years from now, there is no Schlitterbahn, okay?

494
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,260
 3,000 years from now, what you know is not here,

495
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,340
 but 3,000 years after that man's existence,

496
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,580
 we still have evidence of his life.

497
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,500
 And so he looked for purpose in socializing,

498
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,740
 and he said, "Hey, I missed out on my purpose there."

499
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,940
 That's not it.

500
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,100
 You can trust me.

501
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,220
 He looked for purpose in money.

502
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,620
 He made over a billion dollars a year.

503
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,820
 That's not his net worth.

504
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,060
 That was his income.

505
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,920
 Over a billion dollars a year.

506
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,460
 And he said, "Hey, there's not purpose in money."

507
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,860
 Now, I've heard it said that the rich

508
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,820
 are infinitely better off than the poor

509
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,560
 because while the poor think money will bring happiness,

510
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,860
 the rich know better, and that's what Solomon's saying.

511
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,220
 It ain't money.

512
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,460
 Purpose is not found in collecting Benjamins.

513
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,980
 That's not it.

514
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,540
 He looked for purpose in education.

515
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,300
 In fact, he was the wisest man ever to live.

516
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,620
 Rulers would travel to him and pay money to him for advice,

517
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,660
 and he was missing out on purpose in education.

518
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,820
 He looked for purpose in fame.

519
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,500
 Everyone knew who he was,

520
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,660
 and he missed out on purpose in fame.

521
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,820
 He looked for purpose in power.

522
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,700
 Everyone in the land did what this man said.

523
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,500
 He had a power that frankly you cannot fathom.

524
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,220
 He was much more powerful

525
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,420
 than the President of the United States.

526
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,540
 And he said, "There's no purpose in power."

527
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,300
 He looked for purpose in pleasure.

528
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,700
 He could have orgies of any kind, any time.

529
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,460
 I said that before, and someone was offended.

530
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,200
 I'm like, "Read the Bible."

531
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,040
 The man had 700 wives and 300 live-in hookers.

532
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,160
 Okay, it's not porn sites readily available to him.

533
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,120
 It's the real thing any time he wants.

534
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,760
 And he says, "Hey, there's no purpose in pleasure."

535
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,380
 And so he keeps hunting, he keeps looking,

536
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,960
 and he looked for purpose in success.

537
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,000
 He had over 30,000 employees,

538
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,960
 and that's like a decent-sized business today.

539
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,320
 This was in his home.

540
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,000
 30,000 people reporting to this man.

541
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,600
 And he says, "There's no purpose in success."

542
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,080
 He looked for purpose in stuff.

543
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,380
 In fact, he had a house, it was a palace.

544
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,940
 It took 13 years to build.

545
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,420
 I think we have a picture of it.

546
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,760
 My house took less than 13 months to build.

547
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,280
 His took 13 years to build.

548
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,600
 It's huge.

549
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,760
 And he said, "Hey, there's no purpose in stuff."

550
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,680
 It's not the stuff.

551
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,700
 He said, "In fact, this is the conclusion I've come to."

552
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,920
 And so, come back with me, Dallas.

553
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,320
 Come back with me, Portia, you gotta hear this, okay?

554
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,360
 This man is telling you something.

555
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,640
 God is telling you something through his word.

556
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,680
 He's like, "I want you to hear this, okay?"

557
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,120
 Ecclesiastes 12 is the summary of the chapter.

558
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,840
 And he says this, Ecclesiastes 12, verse one.

559
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,060
 "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth."

560
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,000
 Now, he doesn't say, it's interesting what he doesn't say.

561
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,360
 He doesn't say, "Remember God."

562
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,040
 He doesn't say, "Remember Jesus."

563
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,300
 He doesn't say, "Remember the Lord."

564
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,240
 He says, "Remember that you were created."

565
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,480
 There's a God, you're not him, he made you.

566
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,960
 He is infinitely more powerful than you.

567
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
 And in the days of your youth,

568
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,280
 when you are most tempted to go astray,

569
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,360
 you need to be soberly, soberly aware of his existence.

570
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,960
 And then he says this at the end.

571
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
 That's at the beginning of the chapter.

572
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,800
 This is at the end.

573
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
 This is verses 13.

574
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,580
 Now, all has been heard,

575
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,420
 and here's the conclusion of the matter, okay?

576
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,180
 It's gonna give you the conclusion, ready?

577
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,920
 Fear God and keep his commandments,

578
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,820
 for this is the duty of all mankind.

579
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,100
 Fear God and keep his commandments.

580
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,180
 The Hebrew word for fear there is yare.

581
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,180
 It means to live in respect of a sober awareness of God,

582
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,220
 that he's there and you're not him.

583
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,220
 And do what he says, because he's the creator.

584
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,460
 And he frankly knows better than you do.

585
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,020
 Let me summarize this experiment

586
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
 of everywhere I've looked for purpose, here is it.

587
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,420
 There's a God, you're not him.

588
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,420
 Listen to him and do what he says.

589
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,260
 Know him.

590
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,920
 Seek him with your all.

591
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,800
 Live to honor him.

592
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,740
 Solomon lived a purposeless life for most of his life.

593
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,180
 He had everything that you think that you wanted.

594
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,740
 And he said it's meaningless, meaningless.

595
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,780
 In fact, it's repeated throughout the story.

596
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,940
 It's meaningless, it's vanity, it's futile.

597
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,340
 It's purposeless.

598
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,820
 Solomon ran the wrong race.

599
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,760
 Solomon played the wrong game.

600
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,380
 What if, let me ask you a question.

601
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,380
 What if you get to the end of this race,

602
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,220
 the end of this life,

603
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,380
 and you find out you played the wrong game?

604
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,220
 Let me tell you what I mean by,

605
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,660
 Solomon played the wrong game.

606
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,560
 Has anybody here ever played Monopoly?

607
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,500
 If you haven't, I'll explain it, right?

608
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,100
 There's people and you can buy properties

609
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,660
 and railroads and own different things

610
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,540
 and you pass go and you get paid, right?

611
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,140
 And so what you want to do is you want to just collect

612
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,820
 all this stuff so that when people land on it,

613
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,700
 they have to pay you.

614
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,380
 And at the end of it, you want to be the one

615
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,780
 with the most money and the most stuff

616
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,880
 and the most property.

617
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,840
 And this is what I believe that we play.

618
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,280
 I believe we play that game.

619
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,960
 It's the game Solomon played.

620
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,580
 That we would go and get everything we can

621
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,120
 all while having a get out of jail free card

622
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,760
 in our back pocket.

623
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,640
 If we get caught or something doesn't go well,

624
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
 we can kind of pull a mulligan or call a mulligan,

625
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,140
 a do over, if you will.

626
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,460
 And we want to get to the end of this race

627
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,300
 with lots of stuff.

628
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,760
 But here's the problem with that.

629
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,840
 Whoever dies with the most stuff still dies.

630
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,340
 It's the wrong game.

631
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,280
 If you're playing that game, you're playing the wrong game.

632
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,360
 You purchased the wrong game board.

633
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,920
 You're running the wrong strategy.

634
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,600
 And I'm telling you as lovingly as I can

635
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
 before you find out for yourself.

636
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,920
 So you say, well, what's the right game?

637
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,140
 My little girls love this game called Red Light, Green Light.

638
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,400
 You ever played it?

639
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,240
 You ever heard of it?

640
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,060
 Some of you are like, no.

641
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,280
 It's like, you know, we played Red Rover, Red Rover

642
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
 back in my day.

643
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,840
 But they play Red Light, Green Light.

644
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,520
 That's where people will line up here

645
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,960
 and then there's someone over here.

646
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,080
 And essentially you've got to listen to this person.

647
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,620
 And so they'll go, green light,

648
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,360
 and then you run as fast as you can to them.

649
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,240
 And they go, red light, and you've got to stop.

650
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,960
 And if you don't stop, then you're out

651
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,480
 or you get penalized or something.

652
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,520
 You go, green light, and you run as fast as you can

653
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,400
 because you're racing to this person

654
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,480
 and you're listening closely to their commands.

655
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,560
 And that's the right game.

656
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,760
 You hear me?

657
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,240
 You're in a race.

658
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,560
 You're racing right now in all your giftedness

659
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,440
 and all your talents, all your trinkets and your treasures.

660
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,760
 Right now you're racing to God, the creator.

661
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,960
 One day it won't matter about that job.

662
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,000
 Won't matter about that boy or that girl.

663
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,760
 One day it won't matter about that disease

664
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,600
 or the thing that didn't go your way.

665
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,440
 It won't matter.

666
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,240
 You're racing as fast as you can to God, the creator,

667
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
 the heavens, the earth, and you're listening

668
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,920
 to his commands, doing everything that he says

669
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,520
 as he leads you by his spirit,

670
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
 assuming you've trusted in his son

671
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,640
 for the forgiveness of your sins.

672
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,120
 And that's the right game.

673
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,640
 And anything else is meaningless, meaningless,

674
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,320
 vanity, feudal.

675
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,600
 It's the wrong game.

676
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,800
 And so what's the right game?

677
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,960
 What does our purpose look like?

678
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,000
 And that's my third point is this.

679
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,880
 Your purpose is found in living for God.

680
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,440
 Now that sounds churchy, I know, but it's true.

681
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,600
 It couldn't be any more true.

682
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,280
 Your purpose is found in living for God.

683
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,360
 And this is why Jesus, when he was here,

684
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,600
 he talks often about losing your life.

685
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,320
 In fact, it's repeated throughout the gospels.

686
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,360
 He says in Matthew chapter 10, verse 39,

687
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,000
 he says, "Whoever finds their life,"

688
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,480
 that is whoever lives their life for themselves, Dallas.

689
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,960
 "Whoever does what they wanna do when they wanna do it,

690
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,440
 "whoever lives for their pleasure

691
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,840
 "and doesn't find purpose in it,

692
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,400
 "whoever lives for themselves, they will lose their life.

693
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,840
 "But whoever loses their life for my sake,"

694
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 that is to say whoever lives their life for my sake

695
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,400
 in an awareness of who I am and what I've done,

696
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,800
 Jesus says, "They will find life."

697
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,440
 And I want you to know, I'm not naive, I'm not crazy.

698
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,440
 What you, anything wrong you've came in here having done,

699
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,120
 if we don't know each other, I've probably done it.

700
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,160
 That's my story, God saved me as a young adult.

701
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,280
 He came into my life, collided into my life

702
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,680
 in the midst of the party, in the midst of uptown,

703
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,320
 in the midst of clubs, alcoholism, drug use,

704
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,800
 pornography, sexual addiction.

705
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,040
 He collided in my life and he repurposed it.

706
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,280
 And I didn't find life until I lost it.

707
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,720
 And you're there and you're like,

708
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,540
 man, you might be naive.

709
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,720
 No, no, no, I'm not naive.

710
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,320
 Life, life in Christ, that's life.

711
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,440
 You're missing out.

712
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,320
 You're stuck in the same routine expecting different results.

713
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,840
 Sin's robbing you of creativity.

714
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,120
 Life for you is going back to the bar and getting drunk

715
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,480
 and then hitting repeat the next weekend.

716
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,300
 That's not life.

717
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,840
 That sounds really boring, frankly.

718
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,640
 Waking up to strangers, thinking that's life.

719
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
 You know better.

720
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,320
 It's not life hugging the toilet.

721
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,360
 It's not life taking that pregnancy test.

722
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,560
 That's not life.

723
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,240
 You know better.

724
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,880
 Life is found in Jesus.

725
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,320
 I haven't only lived it, I've seen it

726
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,200
 in the lives of others.

727
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,800
 They come in, they think they have everything going for them,

728
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,640
 rich young rulers, and then all of a sudden,

729
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,560
 Christ introduces himself to them

730
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,640
 and everything in their world begins to run

731
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,200
 through the matrix or through the lens of,

732
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,740
 hey, how can I honor God through it?

733
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,120
 And they begin to really live life and leverage their life

734
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,880
 for his purpose and his existence, and then they find life.

735
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
 I see it all the time.

736
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,360
 Now, I'll tell you, my own conversion was a story

737
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,080
 essentially of me stumbling in a church,

738
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,720
 hung over, sitting in the back row,

739
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,160
 and my prayer, as cheesy as it sounds,

740
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,240
 it sounds like a Carrie Underwood song.

741
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,260
 I was essentially like, you know, Jesus, take the wheel.

742
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,620
 I'm tired of driving.

743
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,560
 I'm like, I'm a bad driver.

744
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,220
 If God, if you created everything,

745
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,480
 if you know everything about this world

746
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,560
 and how it operates, then why am I not seeking your counsel

747
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,400
 in every decision, asking, hey, how do I honor God?

748
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,000
 Which car honors God?

749
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,560
 Which job honors God?

750
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,800
 If I'm, what am I gonna wear?

751
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,840
 Well, whatever would honor God the most.

752
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,240
 Where am I gonna go on vacation?

753
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
 Well, where can I honor God?

754
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,240
 What am I gonna do next?

755
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,480
 Well, I don't, God, what would honor you?

756
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
 I'll do that.

757
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,960
 You're the best driver.

758
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,000
 You're a much better driver than me.

759
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,440
 Why don't I just go where you would want me to go

760
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,720
 and live my life for you?

761
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,040
 That's what it looks like, by the way,

762
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,880
 to lose your life.

763
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,800
 God, if it's not gonna honor you

764
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,080
 to take my clothes off right here

765
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,680
 in this person's apartment and do something with them

766
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,880
 that I may regret, then I'm not gonna do it.

767
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,960
 If it's not gonna honor you to go to this website,

768
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,320
 then I'm not gonna do it.

769
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,480
 Father, your spirit inside of me is bigger than he

770
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,320
 who is in the world.

771
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,140
 Would you help me?

772
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,980
 'Cause I can't.

773
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,320
 I'm like a dog to his vomit,

774
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,480
 doing the same things over and over and over,

775
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,520
 expecting to find life, but going back to death,

776
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,240
 going back to the tomb.

777
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,000
 Five seconds later, filled with regret.

778
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
 What did I do?

779
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,660
 What was I thinking?

780
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,500
 Why did I do that?

781
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,880
 God, help me.

782
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,320
 Lead me to life.

783
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,560
 Your purpose is found in living for God.

784
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,800
 That's how you live a life

785
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,880
 of not missing out on your purpose.

786
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,280
 And so let me just put it,

787
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,500
 I told you, I promise I put it as plainly as I can.

788
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,700
 So what is your purpose?

789
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,960
 One is to honor God.

790
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,740
 That's your purpose, to honor God in everything you do.

791
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,920
 And I mean, you can simplify that in whatever you're doing.

792
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,480
 Hey, does this honor God?

793
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,880
 You say, well, how do I honor God, JP?

794
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,720
 What does that look like?

795
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,540
 You ready?

796
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,360
 Two, to know him and to make him known.

797
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
 That's your purpose.

798
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,040
 It's that simple.

799
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,880
 Is that not simple?

800
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,960
 You're like, well, is it this job or that job?

801
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,440
 Where can you know him and make him known?

802
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,000
 That's what it is.

803
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,400
 Well, am I gonna get married or stay single?

804
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,080
 You honor him, married or single.

805
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,540
 See, you can be married and miss out on your purpose,

806
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,880
 and you can be single and miss out on your purpose.

807
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,500
 But married or single, if you live to honor him,

808
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,960
 to know him and to make him known,

809
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,680
 you did not miss out on your purpose.

810
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
 And I promise you, money back guarantee,

811
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,100
 you will not get up there and be like,

812
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,120
 yo, what's up with that?

813
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,120
 Nobody wanted to marry me, huh?

814
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,420
 (congregation laughing)

815
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,460
 I mean, you couldn't even have a dude ask me out or what?

816
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,380
 I mean, what, seriously?

817
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,660
 Let's talk about, no, no, no, that's cool,

818
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,560
 streets of gold and all that,

819
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,820
 but let's just talk about the fact

820
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,260
 that I was single down there.

821
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,020
 It ain't gonna happen, man.

822
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,740
 You get that, like a billion years from now,

823
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
 no one's gonna walk up and be like,

824
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,940
 oh yeah, hey, single Mary, there you are.

825
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,800
 Never got married, huh?

826
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,520
 Single Steve.

827
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,640
 I made those names up just in case your friend's elbowing,

828
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,340
 you're like, he's talking about you.

829
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,180
 I'm not.

830
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,100
 I love Paul's example of this.

831
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,500
 Philippians three, verse seven.

832
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:29,360
 Paul found purpose in his resume until he found Christ.

833
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,860
 He says it so beautiful, ready?

834
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,100
 Verse seven.

835
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,060
 But whatever were gains to me,

836
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,820
 I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.

837
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,700
 What is more, I consider everything a loss

838
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,920
 because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus,

839
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,300
 my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things.

840
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:53,020
 I consider them garbage that I might gain Christ.

841
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,200
 Paul says, I've had everything, just like Solomon.

842
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,860
 Man, I'm the Hebrew of Hebrews, I've got the killer resume,

843
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,980
 I've done everything right, and I now consider it crap

844
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,660
 outside of knowing Christ.

845
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,260
 And if you're gonna email me 'cause I said crap,

846
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
 study the Greek, that's the word.

847
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,220
 I'm serious.

848
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,620
 And so check this out, friends.

849
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,540
 Satan, he's real, he's powerful.

850
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,180
 Roaming around, roaring lions,

851
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,300
 seeking for someone to devour,

852
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,860
 probably devouring some of you.

853
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,140
 Seeks to steal, kill, and destroy, the scripture says.

854
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,580
 He's got one game plan.

855
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,980
 He's got one game plan.

856
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,540
 He wants you to think that things that aren't important

857
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,720
 are really, really, really, really important.

858
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,300
 And he wants you to think that things that are important

859
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,460
 are not important at all.

860
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,120
 That's his game plan.

861
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,380
 I've said it before, he's switching price tags.

862
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,500
 The things of infinite value, the things of eternal worth,

863
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,820
 he tries to make them appear worthless in your eyes.

864
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,820
 And the things of Vanity Magazine or the things of Dallas,

865
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,060
 he tries to make those things appeal to your heart

866
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,500
 so that you would invest your life

867
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,820
 in things that don't matter

868
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,540
 so that you get to the end of this race

869
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:18,240
 with monopoly money and pretend railroads

870
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,520
 and real estate that isn't real.

871
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,560
 You can't take it to the new heavens and the new earth.

872
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,560
 It's like sand in your hands.

873
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,880
 You show up with lots of gold and God's like,

874
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,380
 that's asphalt here, bro.

875
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,080
 What are you doing?

876
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,240
 You've invested in the wrong things.

877
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,320
 You look for purpose in the wrong things.

878
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,060
 And I tried to tell you clearly what it was.

879
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,960
 A self-centered life is a miserable, purposeless life.

880
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,560
 I'd encourage you to practice self-forgetfulness.

881
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,340
 Living to honor God in everything that you do.

882
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,420
 Forgetting what others think of you.

883
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,220
 Forgetting what you have or don't have.

884
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,120
 Forgetting what you're missing out on.

885
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:12,060
 And focusing on who he is, knowing him,

886
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,860
 and making him known.

887
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,780
 Living for his glory.

888
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,140
 Love Ephesians 2.10.

889
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,700
 For we are God's work, handy work.

890
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,420
 It's workmanship, his masterpiece.

891
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,980
 For we are creator gods who created everything.

892
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,620
 We are his masterpiece.

893
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,700
 Created in Christ Jesus to do good works

894
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,580
 which God creator prepared in advance for us to do.

895
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,780
 How crazy is that?

896
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,840
 It says in Ephesians 2.10.

897
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,180
 You might know Ephesians 2.89.

898
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,540
 For it is by grace you have been saved through faith.

899
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,380
 And this is not of yourselves,

900
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,740
 it's a gift of God, not by works.

901
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,820
 So that no one can boast.

902
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,900
 And then Ephesians 2.10.

903
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,860
 For we are God's workmanship.

904
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,860
 Created in Christ, repurposed through Jesus

905
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,380
 to walk in good works which God creator

906
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,580
 before the beginning of time prepared for us to walk in.

907
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,100
 He prepared works for you to walk in.

908
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,980
 He has a purpose for you.

909
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,280
 And how do you find those?

910
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,900
 How do you remove that mystery?

911
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,060
 You live to honor him and you walk in those works.

912
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,980
 It naturally happens.

913
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,020
 His spirit guides you in and through those works

914
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,320
 as you seek to honor him in everything you do.

915
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,860
 And so just if you're here and you're like,

916
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,500
 man, I've been missing out on my purpose.

917
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,420
 I've got some really good news for you before we end.

918
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,600
 And that's just that Jesus died

919
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,940
 for all the terrible things you've done.

920
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,980
 They went on him on the cross, they go in the grave.

921
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,020
 And he came out three days later without them.

922
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
 That happened.

923
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,380
 He was born about 2,015 years ago

924
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,300
 in an event that reset the calendar.

925
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,980
 Every atheist you know acknowledges him

926
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,700
 by the date they put on their checks.

927
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,380
 He's the single most polarizing character

928
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,220
 in the history of the world.

929
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,380
 His book is the bestseller year after year

930
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,160
 and in the history of the world.

931
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,000
 Do you know him?

932
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,340
 And he died for you.

933
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,880
 When he died on a cross, when he was tortured,

934
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,820
 naked, publicly humiliated,

935
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,420
 he did so because he loved you.

936
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,200
 He did for that abortion, for that pornography,

937
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,460
 for that materialism, for that self-righteousness,

938
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,020
 for all the things that you've done wrong

939
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,420
 when you went too far on that date

940
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,100
 or when you go too far on a weekly basis.

941
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,380
 That went on him.

942
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,340
 And when you're born again in him,

943
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,780
 that is you're given his spirit, you're given a new life.

944
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,280
 The scripture says you're a new creation,

945
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,320
 you've been repurposed.

946
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,160
 What is that purpose?

947
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,780
 Now to live to honor God.

948
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
 And you can do that right now.

949
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,020
 If you came in here and you weren't living to honor God,

950
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,040
 right now you can leave here with his spirit inside of you,

951
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,160
 having trusted in Christ, his death and resurrection

952
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,200
 for the forgiveness of your sins,

953
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,280
 and you can live repurposed,

954
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,240
 not missing out on your purpose anymore.

955
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,780
 And what he does, it's really beautiful,

956
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,880
 and I want you to hear this part,

957
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,000
 is he takes all of that crud that's behind you,

958
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,960
 all those things I said, abortion and pornography

959
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,480
 and sex and addiction and alcoholism and drug use

960
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,000
 and self-righteousness, following all the rules

961
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,600
 for the sake of trying to earn something from him,

962
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,920
 he takes that and he makes it your testimony.

963
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,500
 So that you can declare it in a way

964
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
 you never thought you could,

965
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
 you're like, I had an abortion,

966
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,840
 and the girl's like, I did too.

967
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,100
 And all of a sudden you're praying together

968
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,580
 and God's building a ministry around you,

969
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,100
 and people are being set free from their sins.

970
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,740
 Can you imagine, and you get to the end of this race

971
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,080
 and God looks you in the eyes and he says,

972
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,340
 you lived on purpose.

973
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,740
 You even repurposed the terrible things you did,

974
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,520
 my spirit in you repurposed them to set others free.

975
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,740
 How beautiful is that?

976
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,260
 How amazing is that?

977
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,420
 And so in summary, you were created with purpose.

978
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,900
 When you live life for you, you miss out on your purpose.

979
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,300
 And your purpose is to honor God,

980
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,260
 to know him and to make him known.

981
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,100
 To live like this takes intentionality,

982
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,500
 it takes a real awareness, a soberly waking up

983
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,740
 and taking your cross and carrying it daily.

984
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,500
 We had a blast in the Dominican as I started.

985
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,940
 It's a beautiful place, beautiful beaches,

986
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,380
 frankly lots of distractions if you will.

987
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
 At any point you could stop and the marina's there,

988
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,380
 there's a $160 million yacht in the marina

989
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,220
 that we were all looking at.

990
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,060
 There was dancing and parties and amazing food

991
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,100
 and we went snorkeling one day

992
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,380
 and we went swimming in the pool

993
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,980
 and we sat in the hot tubs at night and told stories

994
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
 and we just had a great time being together

995
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,060
 and fellowshipping, but can I tell you something?

996
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,340
 There was a reality over everything that we did

997
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,260
 that we were there on purpose.

998
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,660
 Our friend was getting married, I was doing the wedding,

999
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,580
 I was there to declare the gospel,

1000
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,100
 to make known the mysteries of Christ,

1001
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,700
 to honor this couple as they enter

1002
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,220
 into a covenant before God.

1003
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,740
 I was there on purpose.

1004
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,580
 Now how tragic would it be, I mean if the wedding starts

1005
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,380
 and I'm snorkeling, I'm still sipping pina coladas

1006
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,420
 you know on the beach or whatever.

1007
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,380
 Or I'm hanging out at the bar or I'm sitting in the marina

1008
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,020
 trying to get on a $160 million yacht

1009
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,740
 and I forget about the wedding,

1010
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,420
 I forget the reason that I'm there.

1011
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,340
 And I've seen this happen,

1012
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,660
 I've been to other destination weddings

1013
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,500
 where some of the groomsmen didn't show up

1014
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,940
 because they were sitting at the bar.

1015
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,140
 There's always the people who go to the weddings

1016
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,420
 for the wrong reasons, they're like man,

1017
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,060
 yo, yo, yo, is there an open bar?

1018
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,300
 Look at these honeys here, you know.

1019
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,420
 Not gonna leave single.

1020
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,300
 You know they're there for the wrong reasons, right?

1021
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,820
 They're not there to focus on the couple,

1022
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,540
 they're there for themselves.

1023
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,180
 And some of us, we're gonna get to end this race

1024
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,500
 and we're going to realize we lived it for ourselves.

1025
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,580
 We didn't lose our life, we were so focused on ourselves.

1026
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,860
 Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and blah,

1027
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,860
 read narcissism in us so that we would focus on ourselves.

1028
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,900
 And the enemy wins, but for Jesus.

1029
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,580
 But for Jesus.

1030
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,340
 And so I pray for you that you would refocus

1031
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,020
 on that mission to honor him,

1032
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,420
 to know him and to make him known.

1033
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,580
 To live for him in everything that you do.

1034
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,500
 Have fun, man, go snorkeling.

1035
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,380
 Sit on a beach, watch a sunset, date, hug a friend.

1036
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,820
 Have great conversations, write an email, work.

1037
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,980
 But do so in a way that honors him.

1038
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,100
 In fact, do so to intentionally honor him.

1039
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,740
 I want you to watch some friends of mine

1040
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,780
 who have been repurposed.

1041
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,500
 Would you watch their stories now?

1042
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,580
 (soft music)

1043
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:57,260
 - I was living my life selfishly for pleasure.

1044
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,220
 - I was in a series of broken relationships.

1045
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,980
 - I was a drug dealing alcoholic.

1046
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
 - I was worshiping Hindu gods.

1047
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,740
 - I was seeking to numb the pain

1048
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,700
 and hurt my life through drugs, alcohol and relationships.

1049
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,980
 - I was a party hoppin' Panama City spring breaker.

1050
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,060
 - I was an alcoholic, extremely good at observing

1051
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,660
 and adapting to my surroundings.

1052
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,020
 - In an unhealthy relationship, seeing no value in myself.

1053
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,540
 - I was all about the next party.

1054
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,180
 I spent my weekends drunk and trying to hook up with girls.

1055
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,300
 - I was chasing after my own glory.

1056
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,540
 - Searching for my identity and any pleasure I could grab.

1057
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,580
 - That led me to a broken marriage

1058
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,220
 that resulted in a divorce.

1059
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,980
 - Ignoring how messed up my life was

1060
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,020
 and trading in a life of purpose for a life of partying.

1061
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,020
 - And trying to find my significance and worth

1062
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,020
 through corporate success and broken relationships with men.

1063
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,900
 - Seeking identity and status, money and physical appearances

1064
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,620
 and isolating myself as protection from potential harm.

1065
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,980
 - I lived a life of depression and anxiety.

1066
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,820
 - Then.

1067
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,660
 - Then.

1068
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,500
 - Then.

1069
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,340
 - Then I hit rock bottom.

1070
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,540
 - I got hit by a semi truck, an actual semi truck.

1071
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,660
 - After realizing how broken I was.

1072
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,260
 - And stumbled out of ICU, came to a church

1073
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,740
 and heard of the free gift of grace.

1074
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,860
 - I walked in here to the porch.

1075
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,980
 - I started to seek the Lord and a church.

1076
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,220
 I came to Watermark and discovered biblical community.

1077
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,460
 - At a women's Bible study, I heard the gospel.

1078
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,860
 - I came to the porch and a volunteer met with me

1079
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,220
 and shared the gospel with me.

1080
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,940
 - And to my surprise, Christ was there waiting for me

1081
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,420
 when I was at my lowest point.

1082
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,140
 - Where I clearly heard the gospel click for the first time.

1083
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,700
 - I realized how much I needed a savior.

1084
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,460
 - I was a sinner in desperate need of a savior.

1085
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,260
 - Jesus came to redeem me so that I could find true life.

1086
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,220
 - And I finally decided that I had to live out my faith.

1087
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,140
 - The emptiness and dissatisfaction began to fade away.

1088
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,580
 - I am no longer believing the lies of the world.

1089
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,940
 I'm finding my identity and worth in Christ

1090
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,180
 and who God says I am.

1091
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,860
 - I'm a new creation.

1092
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,860
 The old is gone and the new has come.

1093
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,700
 - I am now a redeemed daughter of a king

1094
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,180
 who finds her worth not in what others think about her,

1095
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,300
 but in the death and resurrection of Jesus.

1096
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,740
 - I've been made clean.

1097
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,260
 I've been set free and I'm not defined by my past.

1098
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,820
 My identity is now in Christ.

1099
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,940
 - Authentically loving, seen as pure,

1100
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,220
 and striving to live life according to God's word and truth.

1101
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,100
 - I'm not perfect, but he makes me perfect every day.

1102
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,220
 - I am now dealing joy and peace and love

1103
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,460
 through Jesus Christ.

1104
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,740
 - Surrounded by other believers

1105
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:20,140
 who consistently point me to Christ.

1106
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,100
 He is my fulfillment and my worth.

1107
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,540
 - Living transparently in my marriage and community,

1108
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,380
 I am saved by grace through faith.

1109
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,060
 - I am confident in Jesus' forgiveness of all of my sins

1110
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,500
 and I have found a purpose for my life.

1111
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,300
 And that purpose is to share the hope that I have found.

1112
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,800
 (congregation applauding)
