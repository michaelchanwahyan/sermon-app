00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:24,680
 All right, well, let's go.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,920
 Welcome everybody in the room, everybody

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,560
 at the 15 Ports Live locations.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,880
 We've got a special treat and special guest for tonight

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,520
 that should Jesus tarry, and in a couple hundred years,

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,720
 they're going to write the history of Jesus

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,480
 doesn't come back.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,940
 At some point in time, they're going

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,600
 to write the history books of the church in North America.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
 And inside of it, I am confident they're

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,560
 going to include something about passion and passion

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,160
 conferences and the impact and the ripple and the effect

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,440
 that that ministry has had.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,920
 My life personally was impacted.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,640
 I remember sitting as a college student

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,380
 and hearing somebody get up on a stage

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,240
 and passionately believe in my generation.

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,720
 And that ripple effect impacted me, still impacts me today.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,340
 And the number of friends and ministry

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,760
 that I have that share that same story is astounding.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,380
 What does that have to do with tonight?

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,220
 Well, tonight, we're continuing this series,

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,560
 and Louis Giglio is here to teach

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,440
 as we continue this series.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,760
 And if you don't, for whatever reason, know Louis,

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,960
 you are about to be blessed.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,880
 He's one of the most incredible teachers of God's word

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,120
 alive right now.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,080
 We are so privileged to have him here.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,260
 So will you give a huge welcome and hand together

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,320
 for Louis Giglio?

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,720
 [APPLAUSE]

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,400
 Yeah.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,520
 Thank you.

36
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,400
 Easy.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 Well, thanks, David.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,280
 And thanks for having me at the porch.

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,840
 My first time ever at the porch.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,720
 Where have I been?

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,520
 What in the world have I been doing?

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,720
 And so grateful to be here.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,920
 So much respect for this house, for the Shanes

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,800
 who paved the way here, JP, other people

45
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,840
 who plowed this ground, David doing such an amazing job.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,680
 Steering the whole team here is incredible.

47
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,800
 So thanks for having me tonight.

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,240
 This is a big deal for us because we're

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,880
 offering a sacrifice of praise tonight

50
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,240
 because we're in the World Series right now.

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
 Like, right now.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,920
 So don't start that Astro stuff because we're

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,120
 about to get in the spirit and stay in the spirit.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,480
 And I don't want anything to disrupt the spirit.

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,280
 My wife's from Houston.

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
 I've lived in Houston on and off,

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
 lived in Texas for a long time.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,000
 I was at the ballpark at Arlington and then

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
 the stadium before that.

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,960
 No one even remembers that.

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,880
 It was like a minor league baseball stadium

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 where the Rangers played.

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,040
 Anybody remember?

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
 A few people here.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,400
 So I was at those games.

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,000
 I went to grad school in Fort Worth, have a lot of history.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,720
 But I'm a Braves fan through and through,

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,800
 born in Atlanta, Georgia.

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 Go Braves.

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,560
 Let's go Braves.

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,920
 That's it.

72
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,680
 Up two zips.

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
 So he's going to keep me posted through the talk.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,120
 The little hand signals down here

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,720
 let me know if I need to preach harder or pray harder.

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
 I'm so happy to be here in this series.

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,800
 You have no idea.

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,920
 As I'm stepping into the series you're doing right now,

79
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,400
 we're all freaking out.

80
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
 But we don't need to be.

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,280
 I am the perfect person for this series.

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,880
 You're like, oh, that's a big boast.

83
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,600
 No, I'm going to tell you a story later

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,120
 that if you don't know my story, you're

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
 going to be amazed that I'm here tonight.

86
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,240
 Because it is a miracle that I am in this place.

87
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,160
 I have been so far down in a hole of depression and darkness

88
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,320
 in my life that I never thought I would so much as

89
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,120
 go to a restaurant again, much less be mostly in my right mind

90
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,840
 depending on who you ask, and filled with the Spirit,

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,040
 the light of Jesus in my eyes, doing the very thing God's

92
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,920
 called me to do, and standing in the grace of God.

93
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,800
 If you told me that 12 years ago,

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,560
 I would have just said, thank you.

95
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
 I'm sure you believe that.

96
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,800
 And somewhere deep down, I probably believe that.

97
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,120
 But I could imagine me walking on water

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,440
 or riding a bicycle to Mars more than I

99
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,800
 could have imagined me being in this place right now.

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,680
 So when I'm coming into this series tonight,

101
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,000
 I take mental health seriously.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,880
 I know personally that depression is real.

103
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,240
 Anxiety is a thing.

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,040
 Fear has got a grip in some way on all of our lives tonight.

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,160
 But what I want to say on top of that is having--

106
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,440
 and I'll come back and explain a little bit more

107
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,080
 about that pit later in the message.

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,480
 But what I want to say is I can say,

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,880
 I think, even though some people hit back,

110
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,200
 even when I try to say this, that anxiety is real

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,400
 and depression is real, fear is real, panic is real.

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 But they are not bigger than Jesus.

113
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 Jesus is greater than all of them.

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,120
 And so they're not going to get the throne tonight.

115
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,080
 So this isn't going to be psychobabble.

116
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,000
 It's not going to be Louie's opinion.

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,960
 It's not going to be us all having a latte

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
 and comforting each other and just accepting the fact

119
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
 that anxiety is a part of all of our lives.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,440
 So let's just learn how to deal with it.

121
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,920
 I was in a situation about seven years ago

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,040
 going through a hard time in leading.

123
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,400
 And leading is hard, by the way.

124
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
 Just heads up.

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,320
 If you're leading something, you already know that.

126
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,640
 But leading is hard.

127
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,680
 And Shelly and I had just come through a very challenging

128
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,400
 season.

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
 Some things have been said.

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,720
 Some things have been done.

131
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,640
 Some friendships had been strained.

132
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,960
 And we were sort of surviving through several months

133
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
 of this deal.

134
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
 And I was on the way home from work one day, David,

135
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
 and my phone rang.

136
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
 And it was a friend.

137
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,120
 And they were calling me with a "you're not

138
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,080
 going to believe this" call that we all

139
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,240
 want to get when things have gone sideways.

140
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,920
 Do you know what the "you're not going to believe this" call is?

141
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,000
 Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,600
 No?

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
 It's the call that goes like this.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
 Is everybody OK, by the way?

145
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,600
 That depression turn might have slowed everybody down.

146
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,880
 We're going to come back up here any minute now.

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
 You're looking at me like, I don't know.

148
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,680
 Really?

149
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,440
 Seriously?

150
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,280
 That happened to you?

151
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,400
 Yes, it did.

152
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
 But so the call was, you're not going

153
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120
 to believe what I just heard.

154
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,160
 And here we are several months down the road,

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,280
 and something happened that vindicated my cause.

156
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,040
 Do you know that call now?

157
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,160
 If you just write it out sometimes,

158
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,880
 a little light will shine, and then you'll go see there.

159
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,520
 And I was so happy.

160
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,600
 I know you're like, what?

161
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,400
 You're a mess, man.

162
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,040
 You were in this hole, and now you want vindication?

163
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,080
 Yes, I'm just letting you know about my humanity tonight, OK?

164
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,000
 I was so excited that when I got home,

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
 I texted a friend of mine who had walked shoulder

166
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,760
 to shoulder through this whole storm with me.

167
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,840
 And I texted him the I want to commiserate text.

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,960
 It goes like this.

169
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,560
 You are not going to believe what I just heard.

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,640
 So-and-so just called me and told me that XYZ just happened.

171
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,080
 I knew it was going to happen.

172
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,000
 I knew if we waited long enough, we would see the true motive.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,480
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

174
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
 It was a lengthy text.

175
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,360
 And in my demographic, my age bracket,

176
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
 I'm talking about a 30-minute piece of work this text was.

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
 And I'm standing in my driveway, and I hit Send.

178
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,840
 And it's the kind of text where you don't send the text

179
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,880
 and then go on about whatever else you were doing.

180
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,120
 You just stare at the phone until you get a text back.

181
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,560
 And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.

182
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,560
 And I want a text back that is--

183
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,640
 it's proportional to the text I sent.

184
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,680
 And all of a sudden, my phone buzzes.

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,760
 And I look down, and there's a little blurb on my phone.

186
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,680
 And I'm like, this is the kind of text

187
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,760
 that the next text says, hey, I'm sorry.

188
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,920
 I hit Send too soon.

189
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,960
 Here's the rest of the text.

190
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,800
 So I didn't even look at the little blurb.

191
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,160
 I'm just waiting for the rest of the text.

192
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,400
 Nothing, nothing.

193
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,000
 Minute goes by.

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,040
 Five minutes go by.

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
 I'm like, this is it.

196
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
 I might as well now look at the little blurb.

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,360
 And I did.

198
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,600
 And when I looked down, there were nine words on my phone.

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,760
 And the nine words from a friend of mine

200
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,160
 that I was looking for commiseration

201
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,600
 and a little celebration of the moment, the vindication moment,

202
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,080
 the nine words on my phone said, don't give the enemy

203
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,400
 a seat at your table.

204
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,640
 And those words, they literally stopped me in my tracks.

205
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,600
 I was frozen at the top of my driveway, staring at my phone

206
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,040
 and realizing, what in the world am I doing?

207
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,520
 For the last five months, six months of my life,

208
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,880
 I have been in this place of consternation and frustration

209
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,560
 and control and laying awake at night,

210
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,400
 having all these conversations, managing all the outcomes

211
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,320
 of everything, making sure everything worked out

212
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,920
 so that people knew what my motives were

213
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,040
 and where I was in the equation.

214
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,960
 And the whole time, I realized I have

215
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,840
 been having a conversation with a killer the whole time.

216
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,920
 The one that Jesus said, the thief comes

217
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,200
 to steal and kill and destroy.

218
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,120
 I have been letting him sit at my table,

219
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,280
 and I've been dialoguing with him

220
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,400
 and letting him influence my thinking and my feelings

221
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,520
 about the whole situation.

222
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,880
 And right then and there, I said,

223
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,640
 I am taking my table back, meaning

224
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,040
 I'm taking my thought life back on this matter.

225
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,880
 I am not going to let the enemy just pull up a chair to the table

226
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,840
 that my shepherd has prepared before me

227
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,200
 in the presence of my enemies.

228
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,720
 I have let Satan just slide in the side door.

229
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,400
 And all of a sudden, I'm not only listening to him,

230
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,480
 I'm talking back to him.

231
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,280
 And now I'm repeating what he's telling me to other people.

232
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,520
 You're like, what do you mean?

233
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
 How would that look?

234
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
 It would look something like this.

235
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
 Psalm 23.

236
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,600
 Do you know the Psalm 23?

237
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,560
 Everybody's heard of it, right?

238
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,280
 Yes?

239
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,400
 Maybe the most famous passage of scripture

240
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
 to people in the church and outside the church.

241
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,320
 You start, the Lord is my shepherd.

242
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
 I shall not want.

243
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,960
 People know.

244
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,720
 OK, I heard that.

245
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,480
 It was in a movie.

246
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,840
 I saw it.

247
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,720
 There was a funeral scene.

248
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,160
 And someone read that Psalm.

249
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,120
 Or there was a wedding.

250
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,280
 And someone said that phrase.

251
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,360
 But this is one of the most gritty, powerful promises

252
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,040
 that God is making to you right now in your life

253
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
 and in this series.

254
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,800
 And if you're struggling with anxiety, with depression,

255
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,560
 with panic, with fear, with worry,

256
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,560
 if you are feeling isolated and you

257
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,760
 feel like you're down in some dark hole

258
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,560
 and you're not really sure if you're

259
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,760
 going to be able to function normally again,

260
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,280
 Psalm 23 is God's promise to you tonight.

261
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,240
 This is not your grandmother's Psalm.

262
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,120
 I know maybe when we go back to this place,

263
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,760
 it reminds us, the Lord is my shepherd.

264
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,520
 I shall not want.

265
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,400
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

266
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,640
 He restores my soul.

267
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,320
 I mean, yes, it feels like cross stitch on the dining room

268
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,960
 wall at your grandmother's house, or a bookmark maybe,

269
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,440
 with a little shepherd's crook on it

270
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,280
 that somebody gave you when you were a kid.

271
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,760
 But it isn't that.

272
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,080
 This is street cred.

273
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,200
 This is legit.

274
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,760
 This is God Almighty saying to you, if you let me,

275
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,920
 I will lead you.

276
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,000
 You don't have to let me.

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
 But if you let me, I'll lead you.

278
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,480
 You can lead yourself.

279
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,840
 But if you let me, I'll lead you.

280
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,440
 You can let somebody else lead you,

281
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,040
 or let the culture lead you, or let the loudest voice

282
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
 on your social media lead you, or you

283
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,920
 can let the news lead you, or whatever's

284
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,120
 happening around you lead you.

285
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,760
 Or you can lead yourself.

286
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,560
 But if you'll let me lead you, I'll lead you,

287
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,600
 starting right now.

288
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,760
 And here are the results.

289
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,720
 I will make you lie down in green pasture,

290
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,560
 because honestly, this sounds terrible,

291
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,600
 but we're not smart enough to lie down

292
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
 in green pasture on our own.

293
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,960
 So he's going to cause us to find green pasture,

294
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,840
 and he's going to slow us down, and he's

295
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,920
 going to make us lie down.

296
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,400
 He says, not only that, I'm going

297
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,720
 to lead you beside still water, and I

298
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
 want to restore your soul.

299
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,240
 I'll guide you.

300
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,560
 Who doesn't want guidance and paths of righteousness

301
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,680
 for his namesake?

302
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,840
 And yea, verily, King James, even if I walk,

303
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,040
 or even though I walk through the valley of the shadow

304
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,120
 of death, I will--

305
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,840
 here comes our word for tonight--

306
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,280
 fear no evil, for you are with me.

307
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,920
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

308
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,560
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

309
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,360
 You anoint my head with oil, and my cup overflows.

310
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,680
 Surely goodness and love--

311
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,960
 that's who's got my back.

312
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,320
 That's who's over my shoulder.

313
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,960
 They will follow me all the days of my life,

314
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,400
 and at the end of this journey, I'm

315
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,760
 going to dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

316
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,800
 Jesus is offering you tonight to lead you like that.

317
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,960
 And if you'll say yes to him, things will begin to change.

318
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,600
 And I believe the fear factor will

319
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,320
 begin to lower in your life.

320
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,720
 Fear doesn't go away when we self-manage internally.

321
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,920
 Fear begins to drift out of our lives

322
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,360
 when we come to a revelation of who

323
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,600
 it is who is with us in the valley of the shadow of death.

324
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,920
 So we don't need so much more like working on the inside

325
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,000
 as we do an awareness of the God who is with us as we're

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,280
 walking through this life.

327
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,360
 I don't know about you, but when I was growing up,

328
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,560
 is everybody OK so far?

329
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
 Are we still doing good in the game?

330
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,400
 Everything's good?

331
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,840
 All right, you're not giving me any signals, nothing?

332
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,160
 Keep looking over there, and you're not giving me anything.

333
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,520
 When I was a kid, we lived in an apartment complex

334
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,800
 that had a swimming pool in the middle of it.

335
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,840
 And on a Saturday, we'd be at the pool in the summertime.

336
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,920
 And my dad was a big golfer, so he

337
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,200
 would come in from golf around 2 o'clock every Saturday

338
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,920
 afternoon.

339
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,380
 And he would drift up to the pool,

340
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,120
 because we'd be up there, my sister and I,

341
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,880
 and all the friends in our neighborhood.

342
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,640
 And when I was little, like this big,

343
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,840
 I could not wait for my dad to get home from golf.

344
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,040
 Because when he came to the pool, everything changed.

345
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,040
 And moms in the world, and future moms in the world,

346
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,680
 you're amazing.

347
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,480
 You're Superman, Superwoman.

348
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,160
 You do it all.

349
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,360
 But I mean, when dad shows up, it's like, oh my gosh,

350
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,920
 dad's here.

351
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,320
 Dad, watch me!

352
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,680
 Dad, watch me!

353
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,640
 I want to do my jump.

354
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,000
 I want to do my whatever.

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,760
 And my dad started us out when we were little,

356
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,480
 and he put us on the edge of the pool.

357
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,960
 Did anybody's dad ever do this?

358
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,440
 And he would say, OK, I want you to jump to me, right?

359
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,080
 And when you were really little, the jump

360
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,320
 meant dad just grabbed you and kind of pulled you in,

361
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,960
 and that was it.

362
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,520
 Then he set you back, and pulled you in and set you back.

363
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,440
 But eventually, he wanted you to take a jump.

364
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,760
 And you're tiny, so this looks like the Pacific Ocean.

365
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,720
 But you eventually decide whether or not

366
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,560
 you can trust your dad or not.

367
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,000
 And I know some of you may not have been able to trust

368
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,240
 your dad or didn't have a dad.

369
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
 But I knew I could trust my dad.

370
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,440
 And I mean, I had an uncle that you couldn't trust.

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,900
 And so he was the one that said jump, and then he was like,

372
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,160
 yeah!

373
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,400
 And then you're underwater.

374
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,960
 And then he grabs you at the last second.

375
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
 Hope you didn't have that guy.

376
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,760
 But my dad, I knew I could trust him.

377
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,240
 So I would just finally give it a little, here I go.

378
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,200
 And boom, he had me.

379
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,120
 And as time went on, things progressed.

380
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,400
 I would take a few steps back and go airborne,

381
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,480
 like real airborne.

382
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,040
 And he would grab me.

383
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,800
 And then eventually, I didn't need dad,

384
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,080
 because I'd just back up as far as you could to the fence

385
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,640
 and run and go airborne on my own.

386
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,920
 But when I started, I knew if I went airborne.

387
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,520
 I knew two things about my dad.

388
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,760
 I knew his heart was good.

389
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,600
 And I knew his arms were strong.

390
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,160
 And I knew that if I left the side of the pool,

391
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,560
 those two things were going to be the most important factors

392
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,480
 in the next few seconds.

393
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,920
 My dad's heart is good.

394
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,840
 And my dad's arms are strong.

395
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,960
 Little scrawny kid like me, he just got you right back

396
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,000
 on the top.

397
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,400
 And knowing that his heart was good and his arms were strong

398
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,800
 allowed me to take a step over the fear

399
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,200
 that I naturally felt.

400
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,920
 So tonight, we're not trying to say you

401
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,320
 shouldn't be afraid of things.

402
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,080
 No, things are scary.

403
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,720
 What we're saying tonight is, do you

404
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
 realize that your heavenly father's heart is good

405
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,920
 and that his arms are strong?

406
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
 See, because what I think the enemy is doing

407
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,200
 as he's sliding in the back door or the side door

408
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,640
 and getting up to our table, where a lot of our lives,

409
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,520
 anxiety is just like-- it's like my little brother, my sister,

410
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,640
 my mom, my stepdad, and anxiety.

411
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,040
 We just give anxiety a seat at the table.

412
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,000
 It's like, that's just the way it is.

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,040
 That's the way it's going to be.

414
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,080
 And you just deal with it.

415
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,800
 You medicate.

416
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,920
 You meditate.

417
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,080
 You struggle.

418
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,480
 You do whatever you got to do.

419
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,880
 And I'm here to say that I do believe anxiety is real.

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,000
 And I still struggle with anxiety,

421
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,920
 because the hole I went down in, you

422
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,520
 don't come out of that without some major scars on your life.

423
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,760
 And there are seasons where my anxiety is still

424
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,640
 a factor in my story.

425
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,440
 But it's more like it's in Plano than it's suffocating me.

426
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
 And I know it's in Plano.

427
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
 It's going to be here in 45 minutes.

428
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,400
 And I got 45 minutes to get my eyes back

429
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,000
 on a father whose heart is good and whose arms are strong.

430
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,160
 So I don't know what it is I'm afraid of right now.

431
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,360
 And it might be legitimate to have a fear of it.

432
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,320
 But my father's heart is good.

433
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
 And his arms are strong.

434
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,840
 And I think what's happened is the enemy

435
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,360
 has come in the side door.

436
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,960
 And it's reduced our view of God.

437
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,680
 And I'm 100% on board with where we are tonight.

438
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,000
 But I think we may have become the generation that

439
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,400
 has sung the song more than we actually believed the song.

440
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,880
 Because we just sang about a big, holy, awesome God,

441
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,800
 a God that should put us on our knees,

442
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,880
 a God who is on a throne unrivaled.

443
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,320
 You think he's concerned about anything today?

444
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,160
 You think he cares about the political climate in America?

445
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,240
 I mean, he cares about it.

446
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,280
 But do you think it's bothering him at all?

447
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,160
 Do you think any global calamity has caused him to lose sleep?

448
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,360
 Do you think he has any rivals, any enemies, any problems,

449
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,600
 any shortage?

450
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,520
 He is sitting on a throne high and exalted.

451
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,440
 And the train of his robe fills the temple.

452
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,600
 And the walls and the doorposts shake

453
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,840
 when the angels say, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty.

454
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,000
 The whole earth is full of his glory.

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,880
 And if you just were transported into that moment,

456
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,360
 you wouldn't do your best worship move.

457
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,800
 You would go, ho, whoa.

458
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,160
 And you wouldn't want to move.

459
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,560
 You wouldn't want to look around.

460
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,760
 You would be like, oh, I had no clue.

461
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,600
 I had no idea.

462
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,760
 I knew you were great.

463
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,120
 But I kind of thought you were just a little higher than me

464
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,580
 and a little greater than me and a little stronger than me.

465
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,800
 I had no idea that you were mind-blowingly awesome,

466
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,920
 that thunder and lightning emanate from your throne,

467
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,520
 and that beings forever have served

468
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,680
 the sole purpose of crying out your otherness.

469
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:12,120
 Set apart, set apart, set apart is the Lord God almighty.

470
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,760
 The way Isaiah said it, bringing it back down

471
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,880
 into our world in Isaiah 41, this

472
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,520
 is God speaking now through the prophet.

473
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,960
 And he says in verse 10, so do not--

474
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:35,360
 here's our word-- fear, for I am with you.

475
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
 Don't you love that?

476
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,680
 And again, I'm not saying that if you're

477
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,080
 struggling that you shouldn't reach out for help.

478
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,920
 You should.

479
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,240
 I'm not saying that if you're in a dark place

480
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,520
 that you shouldn't seek help.

481
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,320
 Please do.

482
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,600
 But God, when he comes into the story,

483
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,420
 primarily he doesn't say, I realize

484
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,680
 that things are difficult, and I don't want you to fear.

485
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,240
 And here are the 19 principles about how you don't fear.

486
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,320
 He said, don't fear.

487
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,600
 I am here.

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,880
 In other words, your awareness of me and your concept of me

489
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
 and your understanding of me, that's

490
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,440
 what puts fear to flight.

491
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,960
 And when we learn the fear of God,

492
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,760
 we don't fear hardly anything else.

493
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,560
 When we step into a relationship with God,

494
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,720
 that we are so stunned by him, you say,

495
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,960
 well, that sounds like a scary thing to have fear of God.

496
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,880
 Listen, if we were in the presence of God,

497
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,540
 we would realize what it means to know the fear of the Lord.

498
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,520
 If we were like Isaiah, who had that vision that I just

499
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,460
 described, we would understand in one second what on Netflix

500
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,040
 doesn't fly in the throne room of God.

501
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
 We would understand in a nanosecond

502
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 what we have embraced in culture and sort of onboarded

503
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,920
 it as, you know, it's just part of living in a broken world.

504
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,840
 No, not in the throne room of God.

505
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,440
 Some of the language we use, not in the throne room of God.

506
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,300
 Some of the things we laugh at, not in the throne room of God.

507
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,480
 Some of the things we tolerate and accept,

508
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,000
 not in the throne room of God.

509
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,440
 There is a fear of God that changes and transforms

510
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,600
 everything about us.

511
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,520
 And the more we fear God, the less we fear everything else.

512
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
 And so this is the way he's speaking to us.

513
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,280
 He says, so do not fear, for I am with you.

514
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:39,000
 Do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

515
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,840
 Not just the God, I'm your God.

516
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,280
 And here's what I'm going to do.

517
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,240
 I'm going to strengthen you, and I'm going to help you,

518
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,480
 and I'm going to uphold you with my righteous right hand.

519
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,520
 In other words, my heart is good and my arms are strong.

520
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
 And I know what you're facing right now

521
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,920
 is incredibly uncertain.

522
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,120
 I know that you cannot control the outcomes,

523
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,560
 and that's very frustrating to you.

524
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,060
 I know that it doesn't feel like you can control anything

525
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,920
 right now, and that's ultimately, I think,

526
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,160
 the root of all of our fear is our inability

527
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,720
 to manage and control things.

528
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,840
 And he's saying, hey, don't worry about it.

529
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
 I am managing and I am controlling everything.

530
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,160
 And my heart is good and my arms are strong, and I've got you.

531
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,120
 I've got you.

532
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,800
 So if you keep your eyes on me and not on whatever

533
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,720
 it is that the enemy is trying to make you afraid of,

534
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,480
 you are going to have confidence and peace welling up

535
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,800
 inside your heart.

536
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,200
 Another way the psalmist said it,

537
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,800
 and I want to just let you see this passage

538
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,320
 because I love it so much, Psalm 34,

539
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,600
 because I just want to make sure you see that I'm not just

540
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,760
 telling you what I think.

541
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
 This psalm's so great.

542
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,400
 Let's just read a few verses together.

543
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,640
 "I will extol the Lord at all times.

544
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,360
 His praise will always be on my lips."

545
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,800
 And that's where I want us to end.

546
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,240
 And I don't know if we'll have time

547
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,760
 to get the whole pit story in and end there,

548
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,800
 but the scripture says, "Put on the garment of praise

549
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 for the spirit of heaviness."

550
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 So ultimately, the dagger to fear is worship.

551
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,600
 The dagger to anxiety is worship.

552
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,320
 The dagger to depression is worship.

553
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,000
 And when you're depressed, you don't want to worship.

554
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,560
 And when you're anxious, you don't want to worship.

555
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,460
 And when you're afraid, you don't want to worship.

556
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,780
 But that's the beauty and the paradox of God,

557
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,000
 is that when we get our eyes off of whatever's making us

558
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,600
 anxious and whatever we're afraid of,

559
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,440
 and whatever is causing us to be depressed

560
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,640
 and put our eyes back up on God

561
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,360
 and choose to open our mouths and worship Him,

562
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,520
 that is when the scripture says,

563
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,440
 "We start wearing the garment of praise

564
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,000
 and taking off the spirit of heaviness."

565
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,920
 And I'm telling you, worship is a weapon

566
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,760
 and it will take out the powers of the darkness.

567
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,640
 "I will extol the Lord at all times.

568
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,440
 His praise will always be on my lips.

569
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,300
 My soul will boast in the Lord.

570
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,240
 Let the afflicted hear and rejoice.

571
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,760
 So glorify the Lord with me.

572
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,400
 Let us exalt His name together.

573
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,960
 I sought the Lord and He answered me."

574
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,500
 And this is the phrase that I really was sensing

575
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,640
 in my heart coming into tonight.

576
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,600
 "He delivered me from all my fears."

577
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,360
 Not some of them, not most of them, not one of them,

578
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,960
 not just the weakest one of them,

579
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,620
 but He delivered me from all my fears.

580
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,460
 How?

581
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,280
 Look at verse five.

582
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,320
 "Those who look to Him are radiant

583
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,880
 and their faces are never covered with shame.

584
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,000
 This poor man called and the Lord heard him.

585
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,040
 He saved him out of all his troubles.

586
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,880
 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him

587
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,920
 and He delivers them.

588
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,760
 So taste and see that the Lord is good.

589
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,920
 Blessed is the one who takes refuge in Him.

590
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,440
 Fear the Lord, you His saints,

591
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,440
 for those who fear Him lack nothing."

592
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,200
 So tonight God's calling you to Himself.

593
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,520
 He's not really calling you away from what you're afraid of.

594
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,600
 He's calling you to Himself.

595
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,960
 He's not really wanting to even negotiate

596
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,300
 around the situation that you can't control right now

597
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,600
 that's making you anxious.

598
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,800
 He just wants to call you up and to Himself.

599
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,880
 And He wants to renew in you a confidence in Him.

600
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,680
 And He wants you to begin to speak that confidence

601
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,920
 into the circumstance and the situation

602
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,020
 that you're afraid of.

603
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,360
 I know for me, and every story is different,

604
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,320
 there's no one size fits all answer to any of the things

605
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,940
 that we're talking about in this series, by the way.

606
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,480
 It's everybody's situation is slightly different

607
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,040
 in the way God wants to touch and heal and restore

608
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,560
 and deliver you is probably slightly different

609
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,580
 than the person next to you.

610
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,680
 So it's not a, hey, here's the formula

611
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,160
 and do this and say this,

612
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,040
 and this is how you get free from anxiety

613
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,040
 and free from depression and free from fear.

614
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,980
 But I know for me, I don't know how I got in that hole.

615
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,800
 I just woke up in the middle of the night one night

616
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,160
 and thought I was dying.

617
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,640
 And the next night it was worse.

618
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,560
 And eventually my wife drove me to the hospital

619
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,760
 at two in the morning.

620
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,720
 And I was 50 years old at the time.

621
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,000
 And I tell you how to get around the line

622
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,800
 at an emergency room is walk in, walk up to the desk

623
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,700
 and tell the person I'm 50 and I can't feel my face

624
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,220
 and my legs are pulsating and they've been doing that

625
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,460
 for a few hours now and I can't get them to stop

626
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,900
 and my arm is numb.

627
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,060
 Come right this way.

628
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,540
 And that night started a series that I just can't get into,

629
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,180
 but it was just craziness.

630
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,300
 I thought I was losing my mind.

631
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,300
 I mean, legitimately, I'm not using that as like hyperbole.

632
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,380
 I thought I was going crazy.

633
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,440
 And for several months, I was in and out

634
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,080
 of all these different doctor's offices

635
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,360
 and having all these pseudo symptoms

636
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,080
 and literally thinking things were happening to my body

637
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,520
 'cause my brain was in some kind of revolt against me.

638
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,800
 And I didn't go out of the house.

639
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,180
 I didn't go to meetings at church.

640
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,400
 I didn't walk into cul-de-sac with my wife.

641
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 I mean, I was just in a ball in the corner for months.

642
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,720
 And I'd been to every kind of doctor

643
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,480
 and had all kinds of people pray for me

644
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,060
 and prayed for myself,

645
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,280
 but just every single night, it was the same thing.

646
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,000
 I'd go to sleep finally and I could manage the days okay,

647
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,120
 but the nights were a train wreck.

648
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,420
 And two o'clock would come and I mean, I would be awake.

649
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,040
 I mean, on the nose, like it's two o'clock

650
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,640
 and I'm staring at the ceiling,

651
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,740
 feeling like something is suffocating me.

652
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,960
 And after a week or two, it was just weird.

653
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,020
 And then after a month or two, it was devastating.

654
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,660
 And about four or five months in,

655
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,720
 it became completely debilitating.

656
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,760
 And when two o'clock came on this night,

657
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,120
 I'll never forget it.

658
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,120
 I just, I felt so frail and so weak and so helpless.

659
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,520
 Shelley's asleep in the bed next to me.

660
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,540
 And I just raised my hands up to God.

661
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:23,540
 And I said, God, I cannot do this one more night.

662
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,600
 And I wasn't contemplating an ultimate decision that night.

663
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,120
 I just was at, I was at the end.

664
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,040
 When people say you're at your wits end,

665
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,880
 that's where I was.

666
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,840
 There was, I could not see one more hour

667
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
 or one more day or one more morning

668
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
 or certainly not another night of this business.

669
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,640
 And then out of my spirit came a verse of scripture.

670
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,900
 See, that's why it's so important

671
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,780
 to put the word in your heart,

672
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,820
 because in the right moment,

673
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,540
 the Holy Spirit will bring that word out of your heart.

674
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,180
 And we'd been in a season in my family years before

675
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,540
 where our whole family had gone through a valley

676
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,940
 of the shadow of death.

677
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,380
 And for months, we'd gone through a really crazy season.

678
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,460
 And at night, this passage from Job

679
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,900
 with sort of my light to help me keep moving.

680
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,540
 Then there's a little verse in Job that says,

681
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,940
 "The Lord who gives songs in the night."

682
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,340
 And so I knew that verse somewhere was way down in there,

683
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,100
 but this night as I lifted up my hands

684
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,780
 on what was kind of for me, my last night,

685
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,420
 that verse just, the Holy Spirit just brought it up

686
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,340
 out of my heart.

687
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,820
 And all of a sudden I realized,

688
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,540
 God, you give songs in the night

689
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,820
 and I've never been in a darker night right now.

690
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,380
 And I don't know why I'm saying this

691
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,380
 and I don't feel like it and it doesn't make any sense,

692
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,480
 but if you'll give me a song, I'll sing it to you right now.

693
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,040
 (congregation laughing)

694
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,260
 And a spontaneous song dropped into my heart,

695
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,720
 just like that.

696
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,940
 I mean, I couldn't put a sentence together,

697
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,240
 but all of a sudden a little song dropped into my heart.

698
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
 You're like, well, you know,

699
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,840
 you were a part of Passion back then.

700
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,600
 You could have picked "How Great Is Our God,"

701
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,300
 or you could have picked a Big Matt Redmond song,

702
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,280
 or, you know, there were a lot of songs to choose from.

703
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,200
 I know, but I wasn't thinking clearly.

704
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,560
 And this little song dropped into my heart,

705
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,920
 this little set of phrases.

706
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,080
 And I sang them.

707
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,760
 It was not a verse, chorus, verse, chorus,

708
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,000
 chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus.

709
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,600
 (congregation laughing)

710
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,520
 It was just four lines.

711
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,680
 And I'm not kidding you,

712
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,060
 I bet I said or sang those four lines until sun up.

713
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:31,560
 You're like, I know where this is going.

714
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,920
 And you woke up and you were healed.

715
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,800
 And you got up and got dressed and went to work

716
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,440
 and y'all had a praise party at the office that day.

717
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,760
 Nope.

718
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
 Thought I was going crazy the next day.

719
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,880
 Went to bed, but when two o'clock came

720
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,680
 and it did come the next night, I was already prepared.

721
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,940
 I had four lines.

722
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,240
 And I sang them into that cloud the second night.

723
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,760
 And the third night, and the fourth night,

724
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,320
 and the fifth night, it was cloud, song.

725
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,760
 Here comes the cloud, I have a song.

726
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,720
 Here comes the cloud.

727
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,000
 And I would just say to God,

728
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,660
 God, you didn't heal me yesterday.

729
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,820
 You didn't heal me the day before.

730
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,600
 You didn't heal me today.

731
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,780
 I don't know if you're gonna heal me tomorrow.

732
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,000
 But I do know this, you are a healer.

733
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,640
 And so I just say to myself again,

734
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,080
 be still my soul, there's a healer.

735
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,640
 His love is deeper than the sea.

736
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,120
 His mercy is unending.

737
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,200
 His arms are refuge for the weak.

738
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,920
 That was my song.

739
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,200
 And then it turned into two o'clock, song.

740
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,520
 Song cloud.

741
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,080
 And then it was just song, song, cloud,

742
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,480
 song, song, song, cloud, song, cloud,

743
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,160
 song, song, song, song, song.

744
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,160
 And I'm telling you that act of worship

745
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,520
 pierced the darkness and led me into the light.

746
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,160
 You're like, that is so too simple.

747
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:19,560
 I know, it's simple like put on the garment of praise

748
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,820
 for the spirit of heaviness.

749
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,800
 How complicated is that?

750
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,840
 Not at all.

751
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,840
 But it's you deciding by the power of God

752
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,080
 and through the grace of Jesus

753
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,820
 that anxiety, fear, depression, they are real.

754
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,640
 Can we just say that?

755
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,880
 They are real and they can take you out.

756
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,040
 But they are not bigger than Jesus.

757
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,920
 And they don't hold a candle

758
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,200
 to the great I am who is sitting on the throne of thrones.

759
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,320
 And I'm telling you,

760
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,360
 I don't know what your experience has been with your dad,

761
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,080
 but I'm telling you about this father,

762
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,080
 his heart is good and his arms are strong

763
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,080
 and you can trust him.

764
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,160
 (congregation applauding)

765
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,860
 On the basis of the cross of Jesus, you can trust him.

766
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,440
 On the basis of the cross of Christ,

767
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,240
 you can believe that he can take the worst

768
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,720
 and make something good.

769
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,200
 On the basis of the cross of Christ,

770
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,240
 you can believe that the worst day on earth

771
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,200
 can become in some way in God's economy,

772
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,720
 the greatest day on earth.

773
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,920
 And based on the authority of the finished work of Jesus

774
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,320
 on the cross, you can believe,

775
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,880
 you can choose tonight to believe

776
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,240
 that whatever your past has been

777
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,000
 does not define what your future is going to be.

778
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,880
 And I know we've sung corporately here,

779
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,880
 but that's not the same as having a song of praise for you.

780
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,120
 Coming into the porch or coming to church on Sunday

781
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,240
 or putting your tunes on in your car.

782
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,000
 It's not the same as getting down on your knees

783
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,400
 in the dark place and say,

784
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,080
 "God, I choose to praise you right here and right now."

785
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,360
 Anyone and everyone can praise God in the noonday sun,

786
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,880
 but when you worship God at the midnight hour,

787
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,460
 your worship is a wrecking ball to the power of hell.

788
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,640
 And the scripture says,

789
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,400
 "The power of life and death is in the tongue

790
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,700
 and the power of your life and your death is in the tongue."

791
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,780
 And we gotta stop listening to the enemy.

792
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,620
 We gotta say,

793
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,700
 "I'm sorry you're not welcome at my table anymore

794
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,820
 in Jesus' name."

795
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,700
 You apparently can prowl around, but you cannot sit down.

796
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,380
 This table is prepared by my shepherd for me.

797
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,880
 Yes, in the middle of the battle,

798
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,980
 but it is a table he has prepared for me.

799
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
 I'm sitting with the king.

800
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
 Thank you very much.

801
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,840
 I got my eyes locked on Jesus.

802
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,860
 Thank you very much.

803
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,080
 I'm getting my cues from the great I am.

804
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,020
 Thank you very much.

805
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,780
 So I'm not gonna go to coffee with you

806
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,740
 and you say, "How's it going?"

807
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,100
 And I'm going, "I don't know, man.

808
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,540
 I don't know."

809
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,460
 'Cause I'm at a table with a king

810
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,280
 and one thing Jesus has never said

811
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,100
 in the history of history is, "I don't know, man."

812
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,860
 Words have never come out of his mouth.

813
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,260
 Do you think we're gonna be able to fix this?

814
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,700
 I don't know, man.

815
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,800
 You think we can solve this?

816
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,640
 I don't know, man.

817
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,940
 You think we're gonna be able to survive?

818
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,540
 I don't know, man.

819
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,300
 And I'll tell you something else he's never told me.

820
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,520
 Never, never, never, never has Jesus said to me,

821
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,220
 "You're not gonna make it, Louie."

822
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,860
 So if we're at coffee and you say, "How are you doing?"

823
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,620
 And I say, "I don't know, man.

824
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,660
 I don't know if I'm gonna make it."

825
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,100
 Where did I get that?

826
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,580
 I got that from the enemy who's pulled up a chair

827
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,980
 at my table and told me one more time,

828
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,660
 "You're not gonna make it through this."

829
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,720
 And I not only listened to him, I am now repeating him.

830
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,840
 So I need a new story.

831
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,040
 You need a new story.

832
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,780
 Not some, again, some, you know, like feel good story.

833
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,340
 You just need truth.

834
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,420
 Even though I walk through the valley

835
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,540
 of the shadow of death, I'm not gonna fear evil.

836
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,980
 Why? 'Cause I'm strong and tough?

837
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,340
 No.

838
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,620
 'Cause I'm big and bold?

839
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,460
 No.

840
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,020
 'Cause I've got major courage?

841
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,700
 No, because you are with me

842
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,360
 and your rod and staff,

843
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,480
 that's what's bringing me comfort tonight.

844
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,420
 You realize Jesus isn't just meek and mild

845
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,380
 with a little shepherd's crook.

846
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,740
 Get the little sheep when they go off the path.

847
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,380
 He's got a rod in the other hand

848
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,840
 and he can take it and destroy a bear or a wolf

849
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,220
 or a lion or a prey that comes out of the woods

850
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,740
 for your neck.

851
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,460
 And he says, "Oh no, no, not her.

852
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,300
 Nope."

853
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,440
 And that's who gives me comfort.

854
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,500
 Tonight's invitation isn't to get more courage

855
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,620
 so you can overcome your fear.

856
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,420
 It's to embrace more faith

857
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,660
 that the God who is with you and in you

858
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,840
 is greater than it all.

859
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,660
 He's greater than it all.

860
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,700
 - He sure is.

861
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,680
 - And someone here tonight,

862
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,420
 it's time for you to open your mouth

863
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:30,220
 in what seems counter intuitive to every human thought,

864
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,180
 like all the things in the kingdom,

865
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,900
 and to sing a song of praise

866
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,800
 to a God who is great and awesome,

867
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,340
 no matter what circumstances around you.

868
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,740
 I'm gonna put my eyes on you

869
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,500
 and I'm gonna open my mouth to praise you

870
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,260
 and the situation may or may not change today,

871
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,460
 but I'm gonna change.

872
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,580
 As soon as my mouth is filled with your praise

873
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:07,840
 and my eyes are locked on your face.

874
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:14,700
 It took a few months for me just to close the story.

875
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,700
 It did take a doctor and medication and a lot of prayer.

876
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,140
 And a few more months after that song in the night

877
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,140
 for me to feel like I come back into life again.

878
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,900
 It probably took a good year

879
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,040
 before I felt like I could sprint at full speed

880
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
 and do all the things I could do before

881
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,640
 without having to worry as anxiety coming

882
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,280
 and shutting me down again today.

883
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,860
 So it's a process.

884
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,140
 So quick fixes, no easy prayers tonight.

885
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,680
 No, I'm gonna raise my hand at the porch

886
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,140
 and eight years of depression are just gonna evaporate.

887
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,980
 No, you're gonna have to start a process

888
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,260
 and I'm closing right now.

889
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,200
 You're gonna have to start a process, but you can.

890
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,020
 God brought me here tonight

891
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,220
 so you could look with your own eyes

892
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,620
 at someone who's been down at the bottom,

893
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,620
 but is standing right in front of you by the grace of God

894
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:20,220
 to tell you from the other side, you are not crazy.

895
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:26,420
 Oh, there may be some crazy in it, but you are not crazy.

896
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,380
 And you are going to make it.

897
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,200
 You are going to make it.

898
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,440
 The shepherd said he's going to lead you through

899
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,540
 and you're gonna make it.

900
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,280
 I'm inviting you to change your story right now.

901
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,220
 And let anxiety be in the mix for a minute,

902
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,860
 but get it off the throne.

903
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:03,240
 Let depression be in the story, but get it off the throne.

904
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,740
 And everything else is on the throne.

905
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,060
 If you have alcoholism in your family,

906
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,660
 it's all your family talks about, right?

907
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,440
 The whole thing, the rehab, the other rehab,

908
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,700
 the thing, the deal, the deal, the deal,

909
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,180
 this happened, that happened, the other thing.

910
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,100
 And before we know it, we're just worshiping alcoholism.

911
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,520
 Our family has been down that road too.

912
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,820
 Your parents bailed out on you and all of a sudden,

913
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,000
 it's just everything that didn't go right

914
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,020
 and all the hurt and all the pain and all the loss

915
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,220
 and the frustration and the anger that built up

916
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,780
 and the bitterness and the resentment.

917
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,360
 And before you know it, your family breaking up

918
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,420
 is on the throne and that's what's getting worshiped.

919
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,900
 What do you mean that's what's getting worshiped?

920
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,300
 That's what I talk about all the time.

921
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,900
 I'm always talking about the breakup or the depression

922
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,780
 or about the loss or about what happened.

923
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,020
 And hey, all this stuff did happen,

924
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,260
 but at the end of the day, we gotta start worshiping God.

925
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,740
 He needs to be getting the conversation.

926
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,420
 He needs to be getting the oxygen in the room.

927
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,060
 He needs to be getting the attention.

928
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,060
 We're not denying stuff has gone down.

929
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,820
 We're just remembering that God is still lifted up.

930
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,740
 And you have the power tonight to change your story.

931
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,940
 You don't have to, and most people in your culture,

932
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,100
 your generation are not going to.

933
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,140
 They're gonna keep that story on them.

934
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,460
 They're gonna keep themselves right at the center of it.

935
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,020
 They're gonna find an individual narrative

936
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,220
 and they're gonna write out that story.

937
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,320
 And in the process of that,

938
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,620
 they're never gonna live in freedom,

939
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,660
 never gonna walk in the light,

940
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,100
 never gonna experience all of what God has for them.

941
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,700
 You can change your story.

942
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:37,140
 God, I pray tonight

943
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,340
 for revelation.

944
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:48,920
 I know that there are people struggling in this room.

945
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,320
 I can see it on their faces

946
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,660
 as I'm looking around the room.

947
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,620
 I can see the fight,

948
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,860
 people hanging on by their fingertips.

949
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,980
 I can see people,

950
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,580
 this young lady particularly,

951
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,700
 and I can just see on her face

952
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,660
 that she wants to believe what you're saying tonight,

953
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,860
 but she just can't.

954
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,620
 She feels like if she believes it again,

955
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,180
 it's gonna be another letdown.

956
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:30,560
 So to the degree that the enemy is lying

957
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,780
 and stealing and destroying,

958
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,620
 to the degree that he is not only at our table,

959
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,940
 but eating our lunch,

960
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,940
 I speak the name that is above every name.

961
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,140
 I speak the name of Jesus of Nazareth,

962
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,700
 who is risen in power and glory,

963
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,400
 and who has broken every curse and every chain.

964
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,300
 I speak in the name of Jesus

965
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,420
 that these are your sons and daughters.

966
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,380
 They are born again, those in Christ,

967
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,380
 to new life and are now in a new family tree.

968
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,780
 They are not stuck with an earthly paradigm,

969
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,780
 but they are children of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

970
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,740
 Their 23 in me got reduced to three in me.

971
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,740
 It's God birthing sons and daughters to brand new life.

972
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,220
 I speak in Jesus' name,

973
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,220
 the distance that you span from heaven to earth

974
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,740
 to pursue, to redeem, to set free,

975
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,980
 to exchange when you gave your life

976
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,180
 to declare our worth to God.

977
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,300
 And I pray that people will receive it.

978
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,180
 I pray, Lord, that you will jettison us

979
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,580
 from the victim mentality tonight

980
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,340
 and move us into the victory of God.

981
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,980
 I pray that you will move us into the victor story

982
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,460
 because we are riding with you.

983
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,180
 And we do pray against depression.

984
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,460
 I pray against the spirit of suicide.

985
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,260
 I pray against the spirit of insignificance,

986
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,900
 irrelevance, the person who thinks

987
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,540
 that no one would even know if they left this planet.

988
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,260
 I pray against every lie that has come from the pit of hell.

989
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,620
 I surrender tonight and just say,

990
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,860
 God, I'm not in control of hardly anything,

991
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,820
 but I am in control of whether or not

992
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,620
 I'm gonna believe that you are in control.

993
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,340
 So tonight I just affirm again that my God is in control.

994
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:50,220
 Your heart is good and your arms are strong for me.

995
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:56,980
 If that's landing in your heart tonight

996
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,380
 in a very personal way, in a powerful way,

997
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:04,340
 I just wanna invite you just to stand into this moment.

998
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,580
 It's no magic in standing.

999
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,260
 We don't have anything for you to fill out.

1000
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,140
 There's no, you know, there's nothing necessarily

1001
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,140
 about that other than you just being defiant tonight

1002
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,100
 and saying, I'm choosing right now

1003
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,660
 to change the narrative of my story

1004
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,500
 and to put my eyes on Jesus.

1005
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,740
 We're all gonna sing to him.

1006
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,260
 We're all gonna worship him together.

1007
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,940
 But I wonder if there's anybody in the building

1008
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,740
 that this has landed for you

1009
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,180
 specifically into your story tonight.

1010
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,020
 If you'd just stand right where you are just for a moment,

1011
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,820
 I'm gonna pray for you specifically.

1012
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:56,420
 God, I thank you for every person

1013
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,420
 that's standing before you tonight.

1014
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,180
 Every valuable life, every precious soul.

1015
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:07,020
 I thank you that you see them and you know them.

1016
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,340
 You could call them by their first name,

1017
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,140
 their middle name, their last name.

1018
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,580
 You know their birth date, you know their death date,

1019
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,100
 you know every single thing about their lives.

1020
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,460
 And I thank you tonight that you have connected

1021
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,940
 your truth to their lives in a very powerful

1022
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,220
 and a very personal way.

1023
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,500
 Lord, I'm just gonna pray for you

1024
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,420
 and I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1025
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,820
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1026
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,420
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1027
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,220
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1028
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1029
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,820
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1030
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,620
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1031
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,420
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1032
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,220
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1033
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1034
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1035
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1036
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:50,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1037
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1038
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1039
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1040
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1041
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1042
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1043
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1044
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1045
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1046
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1047
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1048
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1049
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1050
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1051
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1052
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1053
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,020
 I'm gonna pray for you tonight.

1054
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,020
 I am walking in power.

1055
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,020
 I am moving in my gifts.

1056
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,020
 And I'm watching God do the supernatural in my life.

1057
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,020
 Lord, we thank you for that.

1058
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,020
 And we give you thanks.

1059
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,020
 And we give you praise for it.

1060
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,020
 In the mighty name of Jesus.

1061
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,020
 And everybody says,

1062
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,020
 Amen.

1063
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,020
 Amen.

1064
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,020
 Amen.

1065
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,020
 Amen.

1066
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
 Let's worship Him together.

1067
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,020
 There's a verse in Isaiah chapter 26, verse 3,

1068
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,020
 that says, "You keep in perfect peace

1069
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,020
 him whose mind is stayed on you."

1070
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,020
 That verse has, for so many years,

1071
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,020
 felt so impossible to me.

1072
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,020
 You keep in perfect peace?

1073
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:14,020
 The one whose mind is fixed on God.

1074
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,020
 And I shared this a couple weeks ago.

1075
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,020
 In this season of thinking and praying

1076
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,020
 and studying on anxiety,

1077
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,020
 it's like that began to click,

1078
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,020
 and it connects so much to what Louis just shared.

1079
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,020
 It's like the more that I have my eyes fixed around the fact

1080
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,020
 that my Father,

1081
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,020
 His heart is good.

1082
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:36,020
 And His hands and His arms are strong.

1083
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,020
 That no matter what I walk through,

1084
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,020
 He may not always heal it in the time frame,

1085
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:48,020
 in the way that I want.

1086
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,020
 But He is enough.

1087
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,020
 And whatever you are walking through, He is enough.

1088
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,020
 He wants to meet you where you are at,

1089
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,020
 and come alongside,

1090
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,020
 and for you to know, you have a Father

1091
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,020
 whose heart is good,

1092
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,020
 and whose hands are strong.

1093
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,020
 And you're going to leave this room,

1094
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,020
 and the world around you,

1095
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,020
 like a kid at the pool,

1096
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,020
 is going to say, "You can't trust Him.

1097
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,020
 You shouldn't trust Him.

1098
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,020
 You shouldn't trust Him."

1099
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,020
 And all these messages.

1100
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,020
 But you need to remember,

1101
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,020
 as you walk through the valley of the shadow of fill-in-the-blank,

1102
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,020
 His heart is good.

1103
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,020
 He is enough.

1104
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,020
 And you're going to make it, because His hands are strong.

1105
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,020
 If you've never had a moment

1106
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,020
 where you've trusted in Christ,

1107
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,020
 and by that I mean you have accepted

1108
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,020
 Jesus' death

1109
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,020
 as payment on the cross for your sin.

1110
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,020
 Everything past, everything present,

1111
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
 everything you don't even know you're going to do

1112
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,020
 three months from now, paid for.

1113
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,020
 All of it nailed to the cross.

1114
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,020
 You're not a Christian.

1115
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,020
 You've never taken the step to become a Christian,

1116
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,020
 which is not something you do,

1117
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,020
 it's something you receive by faith in Jesus.

1118
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:54,020
 Tonight is your night, and we'd love to pray with you.

1119
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,020
 If you're walking through a time where you're just in a hard season,

1120
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,020
 and we can come along,

1121
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,020
 and we can pray with you.

1122
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,020
 If there's any way that we can serve

1123
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,020
 whatever you're going through, we'd love to do that,

1124
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,020
 and we have an entire team that'll be down front.

1125
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,020
 Maybe you're not in a place where you're ready to make that decision,

1126
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,020
 you just have questions,

1127
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,020
 and they're normal, understandable questions.

1128
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,020
 When you study scripture,

1129
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,020
 it doesn't all click.

1130
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
 We create an environment every month called Great Questions,

1131
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
 where you can go right down this hall, right over here,

1132
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,020
 and there's a room of our friends

1133
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
 that is designed for you to ask questions

1134
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,020
 on your journey, wherever you are in the faith.

1135
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,020
 Finally, we do something called First Step,

1136
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
 where if you don't have a church home, welcome home.

1137
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
 We want to help you take the first step

1138
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,020
 in making a place that feels so big,

1139
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,020
 feel a lot smaller, so you can take your first step

1140
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,020
 into getting connected here,

1141
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,020
 right outside of these doors, up in the loft,

1142
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,020
 outside of here. If you have a church home,

1143
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,020
 we're not here to steal Christians,

1144
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,020
 we want you to go deeper in wherever God has you,

1145
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
 and be His people there.

1146
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,020
 Finally, I've got two requests.

1147
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,020
 One is, as I mentioned earlier,

1148
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,020
 there is a conference called Passion Conference.

1149
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,020
 If you haven't heard of it,

1150
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:02,020
 and you've been under a rock,

1151
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,020
 you need to go to passion2022.com

1152
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,020
 and find out.

1153
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,020
 It's an amazing gathering

1154
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
 of 60,000 college students

1155
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,020
 and young adults

1156
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,020
 that will be gathering

1157
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,020
 in January of this year.

1158
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,020
 That's too small for me to read.

1159
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,020
 January 2nd and 3rd.

1160
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,020
 Oh, it's a lot bigger up there.

1161
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,020
 January 2nd and 3rd.

1162
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,020
 And I'm telling you, this is my request.

1163
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,020
 If you are in college,

1164
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,020
 you need to go to that conference.

1165
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,020
 There's a Ports discount code,

1166
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
 where tonight you get a steep discount

1167
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,020
 for $109, which is

1168
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,020
 losing money on you

1169
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,020
 that they are basically giving for you to be,

1170
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,020
 because they believe in this generation.

1171
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,020
 If you are not in college,

1172
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,020
 and maybe you're like, "Man, I'm 28.

1173
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,020
 I don't even know where I fit in

1174
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
 in all of this."

1175
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,020
 Welcome here, you fit in here.

1176
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,020
 But you know some college students,

1177
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,020
 and I'm asking you to do something very specifically.

1178
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,020
 I want you, if you know someone that needs to be there,

1179
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,020
 I want you to buy their ticket, and I want you to text them

1180
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
 and say, "Hey, bro. Hey, sis.

1181
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,020
 I got plans for you. January 2nd and 3rd.

1182
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,020
 In Atlanta. Louis came and made a trip out here,

1183
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,020
 and I want you to go make a trip and go see him."

1184
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,020
 And you won't be

1185
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,020
 at all regretting that you did.

1186
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,020
 And so, if you're in college

1187
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,020
 18 to 24,

1188
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,020
 you should be there.

1189
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,020
 And you'll be glad you did.

1190
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,020
 And if you're not in that age frame,

1191
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,020
 I want you to prayerfully consider sending it,

1192
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,020
 because it just may change someone's life.

1193
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,020
 I've heard it over and over

1194
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,020
 and over.

1195
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,020
 So use the promo code PORTS tonight.

1196
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,020
 Finally.

1197
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,020
 Everything that I said about

1198
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,020
 history books and that with Louis and his team

1199
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,020
 is not an overstatement.

1200
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,020
 And so I want you guys

1201
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,020
 to help me thank, not just for him traveling

1202
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
 and being away from family tonight, but the

1203
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,020
 investment he has made

1204
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,020
 on so many generations,

1205
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
 or on multiple generations,

1206
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,020
 of this generation.

1207
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
 And thank him also for being here tonight.

1208
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,020
 So we thank Louis and his team one more time.

1209
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,600
 (upbeat music)
