00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,080
 - All right, Dallas, how we doing?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,800
 Hello, Dallas.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,040
 Hello to Fort Worth and everybody else streaming online.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,780
 My name is Adam Tornow.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,960
 I'm excited to be here.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,420
 Thank you, that's awesome.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,380
 My mom and family are up there.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,400
 So anyway, I am excited to be here to continue

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,120
 the First Comes Love series with you guys tonight.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,960
 And tonight, I'm just gonna jump right into

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,640
 what our subject is because we got this whiteboard here.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 And so tonight is going to be a little bit of sex ed.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,320
 All right, so that's what we're gonna do tonight.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,440
 And so I know some of y'all are nervous

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,800
 'cause you're like, he's got a pen,

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,500
 there's a lot of white space.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,640
 There are gonna be some drawings,

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,920
 but they're all tame, okay?

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,380
 So anyway, where I wanna start off tonight is,

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,300
 my story is probably very similar to your story

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,040
 when it came to sex ed.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,900
 If I look at it, I really had a lot of education growing up,

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,560
 but it was all a miseducation.

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,160
 And so what I wanna do is I wanna kinda

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,940
 give you guys a little glimpse into my life

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,840
 and go through kind of the miseducation

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,140
 and the reeducation of Adam Tornow when it came to sex.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,600
 And so let's start off with some of the miseducation.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,260
 The miseducation for me started when I was seven years old

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,940
 with an incident that I will call the snowman incident.

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,420
 All right?

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,760
 You might've had a snowman incident.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,920
 I practice these drawings, by the way, so there we go.

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
 So there's the snowman incident.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,800
 So the snowman incident happened when I was seven years old

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,680
 and it was snowing, that's why there was a snowman.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,240
 It was snowing at my house where I was.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
 I didn't grow up here.

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,880
 I grew up in the Washington, DC area.

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,180
 And so it had snowed and I went outside

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,600
 to go play in the snow.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,000
 And my next door neighbor had a snowman in their front yard

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,320
 and on that snowman, there were two older neighbor kids.

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,720
 They were on that snowman tearing it down.

46
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,640
 They were destroying it.

47
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,700
 And so the seven year old Adam got pretty excited

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,740
 watching these older kids tear this snowman down.

49
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,700
 And so I decided to go next door and to watch them

50
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,640
 as they tore this snowman down.

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,740
 And as they were tearing down the snowman,

52
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,220
 they kept saying this word over and over and over again

53
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,500
 that I had never heard before.

54
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,560
 My little first grade seven year old mind

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,920
 had never, or your ears, had never heard this word.

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
 And this was the F word, all right?

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,760
 So they kept, I'm not gonna write the whole word,

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,880
 I'm just gonna say F word.

59
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
 Honestly, I was about to write it.

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
 I really was.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,640
 So that is the spirit of God at work right now in me

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,820
 to hold me back from all that.

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,920
 So anyway, seven years old, I am hearing this word

64
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,080
 and I'm asking these guys, I'm like,

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,600
 "Hey, what is that word you're saying?"

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,440
 And they're like, "Which word?"

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,800
 And I'm like, "That one, the F word

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
 "that you keep saying over and over and over again

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,440
 "in probably all the wrong contexts, you know,

70
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,160
 "using it as an adverb and an adjective and a noun

71
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
 "and all that kind of stuff."

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,200
 And so they, in the most crass way humanly possible,

73
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
 described to me what the F word really meant.

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,880
 They talked about body parts

75
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,160
 and this is where babies came from.

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,780
 I mean, they gave me the complete education

77
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,800
 at seven years old.

78
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,720
 And at the end of that conversation, I'll never forget,

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,800
 they said, "If you don't believe us, go ask your dad."

80
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,720
 And so I just filed that, you know,

81
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
 and so that may be some information

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,120
 that is gonna be helpful.

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,940
 Well, fast forward two hours, all right?

84
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,940
 So I'm now in my house, we had just finished eating

85
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,560
 and we're getting the bedtime routine

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
 is getting ready to start.

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,840
 My mom is now in the bathroom giving my baby sister a bath.

88
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,000
 My dad happened to be in the bathroom at the same time

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,080
 talking to my mom about something.

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,460
 And so I remembered this word

91
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,680
 and that I should ask my dad.

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
 And so I walked right into that bathroom

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,840
 and I just said, "Dad, what's F mean?"

94
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,040
 And my mom screamed and she's like,

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,240
 covered my baby sister's ears.

96
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,480
 My dad picked me up and like took me out into his office

97
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,200
 and we sat down and he said,

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,360
 "Well, what do you think it means?"

99
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,180
 And I used all those crass words over again.

100
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,120
 And he said, "Yes, that is a somewhat accurate description

101
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,640
 "of what that word means and help me say it

102
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
 "in a little better way."

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,980
 And so from seven years old, I was, my little mind

104
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,400
 was now exposed because of the snowman incident

105
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
 into this world of sex.

106
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,120
 And I learned the F word.

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
 So now fast forward a couple of years.

108
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,680
 So now I'm about 10 years old.

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,680
 I'm about 10 years old and my dad decides to give me a book.

110
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,600
 And I'll never forget the title of this book.

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,580
 I was 10 years old, it was right,

112
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,440
 I think I was in fifth grade.

113
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,980
 And my dad comes up to me one day and he goes,

114
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,980
 "Here's a book that you're gonna need.

115
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,100
 "There's some information in here

116
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,280
 "that's gonna be helpful for you."

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,840
 And I'll never forget the book.

118
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,320
 It was called, "What's Happening to My Body,

119
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,640
 "A Book for Boys."

120
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,920
 [congregation laughing]

121
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,880
 Now, I'm a little bit of a late bloomer, okay?

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
 And my kids still, my two boys now still make fun

123
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,280
 of my lack of ability to really grow a beard

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
 or anything like that.

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
 So I promise you at 10 years old,

126
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,840
 there was nothing at all happening to my body, okay?

127
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,520
 So this was literally just a book for boys for me.

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,860
 And so I remember being handed this book

129
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,780
 and he just telling me, "Hey, there's some information here

130
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,620
 "you're gonna need."

131
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,840
 And so I go into my bedroom and I open up the book

132
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,480
 and I'm like, I see these drawings

133
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
 of different stages of puberty

134
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,680
 and a husband and wife engaged in some sexual activity.

135
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,200
 And I'm like, I do not know what this book is.

136
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,280
 I don't even think I read all of it.

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,120
 I do remember at one point going to ask my dad one question

138
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,340
 of like, what does this word mean?

139
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,840
 And it was the word circumcision.

140
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,760
 And so we had a conversation about that.

141
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,320
 And so I had this book and it was,

142
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
 "What's Happening to My Body, A Book for Boys."

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,220
 So I knew what this sexual activity was.

144
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,140
 I knew some, now had some mental pictures in my mind,

145
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,940
 some drawings of what sex meant,

146
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,820
 but that wasn't the end of my miseducation.

147
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,780
 The end of my miseducation happened

148
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,460
 when I was about 12 years old.

149
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,620
 And it happened when I was hanging out with some friends.

150
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,740
 And so at 12 years old was still a time here in America

151
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,180
 where Netflix wasn't around, DVDs weren't around.

152
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,640
 And so if you wanted to watch a movie,

153
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,500
 you had to go to a video store.

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,140
 And so some of your parents maybe have talked to you

155
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,140
 about a video store, but basically a video store

156
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,360
 is where you went and that's where you rented videos.

157
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,200
 And then you went home

158
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,580
 and then you had to take the videos back.

159
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,580
 And so this one video store in the neighborhood

160
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,380
 or in the town where I was growing up in,

161
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,940
 my buddies and I would get on our bike.

162
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,220
 We drive up to this video store one day

163
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,780
 and we knew this video store had an adult section

164
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,860
 and it was so seedy.

165
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,500
 It was like back in the corner,

166
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,860
 there was this dark curtain that would cover up the section

167
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,660
 and people would sneak in there.

168
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,260
 And the way this video store worked is out on the floor

169
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,700
 where all the movies that you could rent,

170
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,060
 it was just the cover of the movie.

171
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,720
 You would take the cover up to the counter

172
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,120
 and you'd say, I wanna rent this movie.

173
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,500
 This is ET or Raiders of the Lost Ark or whatever it is.

174
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,540
 And then they would go back behind the counter

175
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,740
 on the shelves and they would take the movie off

176
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,740
 and they would hand it to you and that's how you rented it.

177
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,180
 Well, one of my friends figured out

178
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,520
 that all of those adult movies

179
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,660
 that were back there behind that curtain,

180
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,220
 where they were stored on the shelves

181
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,740
 was actually right by the front door.

182
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,380
 And so he decided one day, he said,

183
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,700
 hey, let's go up there, let's steal one of those movies.

184
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,220
 I'll hop over the counter, I'll grab it and we'll run out.

185
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,760
 And as 12 year olds, we said, that sounds like fun.

186
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,660
 So we rode our bikes up there and my friend went over there.

187
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,140
 He pulled that movie off the shelf.

188
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,540
 We jumped off, or he jumped over the counter.

189
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
 We got on our bikes and we went home.

190
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,960
 His parents were not home and we plopped in that movie.

191
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,160
 And I saw for the first time,

192
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
 my first pornographic movie at the age of 12.

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,600
 So I was 12 years old when that happened.

194
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,560
 So I had heard about it when I was seven.

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
 I had seen pictures of it when I was 10

196
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,240
 and now two years later at 12, all of it came together.

197
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
 And for the very first time,

198
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
 I saw how all of this was supposed to work.

199
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,140
 So from the age of 12 up until the age of 21,

200
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,920
 my goal when it came to this new information

201
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,600
 that I had found, my goal was basically to consume

202
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,960
 as much pornography as I possibly could

203
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,360
 and to try to engage in as much activity

204
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,640
 that I saw on those movies as I could.

205
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,760
 And unfortunately, I had some success.

206
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,880
 I was able to consume a lot of pornography

207
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,120
 from the ages of 12 until about age 21.

208
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,760
 And unfortunately, I was able to engage

209
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
 in some inappropriate relationships with other girls.

210
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,480
 And I just thought this was normal.

211
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,300
 This is what all my friends were doing.

212
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,840
 And my parents really,

213
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,880
 we weren't having too many conversations about it.

214
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
 And I just thought, hey, I have a sex education

215
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,160
 and now I'm using that education.

216
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,960
 And then it all kind of came to an end

217
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,080
 and it came to an end very dramatically.

218
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
 And the miseducation now ended when I was 21

219
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,780
 and it ended when I met this guy.

220
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,420
 And I'll call, and his name is John and I was 21 years old.

221
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,400
 I was in college at the time

222
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,440
 and I had just become a Christian.

223
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,480
 A guy in my fraternity had shared with me

224
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,600
 about this Jesus that Shane had just gotten done

225
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,760
 talking about and I had come to understand

226
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,800
 that I was a sinner in need of a Savior

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
 and that Savior was Jesus Christ.

228
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,040
 And God in His grace and in His mercy,

229
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,260
 He opened my eyes right before my 21st birthday

230
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,720
 to see that I needed that Savior Jesus.

231
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,480
 And I placed my trust in Jesus Christ

232
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,360
 as my Lord and Savior.

233
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,400
 A lot of things started to change immediately

234
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,500
 when I came to know Jesus.

235
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,040
 And one of the things that started to change

236
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,840
 is I no longer had this goal of trying to seek out

237
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,560
 inappropriate relationships with females.

238
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,080
 And the only reason that that changed immediately

239
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,840
 is because my view of the Bible,

240
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,280
 what I learned during my miseducation

241
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,160
 is my view of the Bible is that God

242
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
 did not want us to have sex.

243
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,080
 My view of the Bible at that time was,

244
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,220
 hey, don't do a bunch of stuff if you wanna get to heaven.

245
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,080
 And so even though I understood

246
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,960
 just these early understandings of grace,

247
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,760
 I still had this wrong view of God

248
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
 that He didn't want me to do stuff that was fun,

249
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,160
 that He was this killjoy in the sky.

250
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,200
 And so I still believed that,

251
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,920
 hey, God doesn't want me to have sex,

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,680
 and so therefore I'm not gonna have sex.

253
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,400
 But I meet this guy named John.

254
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,660
 He starts to disciple me,

255
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,120
 meaning he starts to spend time with me.

256
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,440
 He starts to teach me the Bible.

257
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,600
 And John starts to really challenge my view of God.

258
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,960
 He's like, Adam, he's not just this God

259
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
 that is up there trying to hold you back

260
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,120
 and say, hey, don't do all this kind of fun stuff.

261
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
 He's not trying to rip you off.

262
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
 He's trying to set you free.

263
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,680
 He's got views of life,

264
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,420
 and he's got this preferred future for you,

265
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,080
 and he's got these ways that he wants you to walk in.

266
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,920
 And it's not because he doesn't want you to have fun.

267
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,360
 He wants you to walk in these ways because he loves you

268
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,240
 and because he knows what is best for you.

269
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,160
 And so for a few years there in college,

270
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,240
 I got to spend time with John,

271
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,960
 and John was the first adult man that I had ever talked to

272
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,400
 that we had this really frank

273
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,160
 and healthy conversation about sex.

274
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,060
 And he started to tell me about God's view of sex,

275
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,140
 and he was saying things that I had never heard before,

276
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,640
 that sex was designed by God, that it was created by God,

277
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,120
 that it wasn't dirty,

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,960
 that it was something that was reserved for married couples,

279
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
 all this kind of stuff.

280
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 It was all brand new based on the miseducation that I had.

281
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,520
 And so then by the grace of God from about age 22

282
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,360
 until about the age 27,

283
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,880
 I had this great opportunity to be involved in the church.

284
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,940
 So all the things that John had told me

285
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,020
 as he opened up God's word and he explained to me

286
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,540
 this heart of God and how much he loved us,

287
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,620
 I then got to sit in all these great churches

288
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,660
 that were continuing to faithfully open up God's word

289
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,180
 and teach.

290
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,020
 And oftentimes they taught about this view,

291
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,620
 God's view of human sexuality.

292
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,940
 And it was completely different

293
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,120
 than anything I had ever heard before.

294
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,660
 And then when I was 28 years old,

295
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
 by this time I had gotten into a relationship

296
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,940
 with a young lady named Jackie,

297
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,660
 and when I was 28 years old,

298
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,900
 we got to take a class here at Watermark.

299
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,220
 And the class was called Merge.

300
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,880
 And that's the logo.

301
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,000
 Don't tell Scott, all right?

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,100
 And so we were seriously dating,

303
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,500
 we were about ready to get engaged,

304
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,300
 and we wanted to take this pre-married class.

305
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,780
 And in that class we heard about a whole bunch of subjects,

306
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,740
 and one of the subjects we talked about

307
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,660
 was physical intimacy.

308
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,100
 And we talked about, from a biblical perspective, sex.

309
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,500
 And I was learning for the very first time

310
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,740
 that sex isn't just this physical act

311
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,300
 that a husband and wife do or that two people do.

312
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,020
 It's not just body parts that are touching.

313
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,380
 That this is deeply emotional, it's even spiritual.

314
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,460
 It's largely dependent on the quality of a relationship.

315
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,340
 And so all of this happened by the time that I was 28.

316
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,340
 And by the grace of God, by the time I got married,

317
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,400
 I not only went through a miseducation,

318
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,140
 by the grace of God I was able to go through a re-education

319
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,780
 of a completely, totally different view of sex,

320
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,100
 a biblical view of sex.

321
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,420
 And I start with all that tonight

322
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,900
 because that's what I wanna do tonight.

323
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,300
 I wanna try tonight for us to re-educate ourselves

324
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,220
 on this subject that has been so distorted.

325
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,100
 It has been, there's so many lies out there in the culture,

326
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,900
 and that so many of us probably have stories

327
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,740
 very similar to mine.

328
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,860
 You may not have it go out the exact same way,

329
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,020
 but I bet a lot of you would go,

330
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,860
 "Hey, that's my story too.

331
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,460
 "I have had a miseducation, and by the grace of God,

332
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,220
 "I'm experiencing a re-education."

333
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,460
 And so tonight, I hope is a part of that process

334
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,140
 for all of us as we're re-educating our minds

335
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,380
 and trying to view this really sensitive

336
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,100
 and important subject from God's perspective.

337
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,460
 And so hopefully that's what we're gonna be able to do.

338
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,900
 And the reason that I start with all this,

339
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,700
 or one of the things that I want to say,

340
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
 why this is so important is that as I went through

341
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,620
 both of these educations, here's what's crazy.

342
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,700
 I can stand up here with complete and total confidence

343
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,700
 and tell you the church has the best information on sex.

344
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,900
 The best.

345
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,540
 And there's one person really excited about that.

346
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,860
 (congregation laughing)

347
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,380
 I hope there's gonna be a lot of you clapping

348
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,260
 by the end of this, and I can convince you

349
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,140
 that the church has the best information on sex.

350
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,660
 I've been through, I've listened to what my friends told me,

351
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,380
 I've listened to what books have told me,

352
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,780
 and what the culture through movies would try to tell me,

353
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,860
 and I would tell you this,

354
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,060
 is that what the church teaches about sex,

355
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,820
 what God's word says about sex, is without a doubt,

356
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,300
 the most helpful, the most refreshing,

357
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,260
 and the best information that is out there.

358
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,980
 And I know for some of you, that sounds like crazy talk,

359
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,900
 but it makes complete and total sense,

360
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,140
 because sex is not the world's idea.

361
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,820
 It's God's idea.

362
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,420
 And so it makes complete and total sense

363
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,700
 that God would have the best information about all this.

364
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,540
 And so what we're gonna do

365
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,820
 as we go through this re-education

366
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,380
 is we're gonna try to look at two things, really.

367
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,020
 We're gonna just look at some of the basics.

368
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
 We can't cover all of it,

369
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
 but we're gonna look at some of the basics

370
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,500
 on what the biblical overview is on sex,

371
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,700
 and then we're gonna come down here second,

372
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,780
 and we're gonna look at some common misunderstandings

373
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,660
 that are out there.

374
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,020
 'Cause we've all got 'em,

375
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,460
 and so we're gonna look at three common misunderstandings

376
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,300
 that are out there.

377
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,420
 So let's go through the basics here first.

378
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,700
 Here's some of the basics

379
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,100
 from a biblical perspective on sex.

380
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,460
 The very first thing that we need to know

381
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,780
 is that it was that sex was created by God.

382
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,860
 If you got your Bibles, look at this.

383
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,860
 In Genesis chapter one, verse 28, here's what it says.

384
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,220
 It said, "God blessed them,"

385
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,340
 he's talking to Adam and Eve,

386
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,140
 "God blessed them and said to them,

387
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,340
 "'Be fruitful and increase in number.

388
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,820
 "'Fill the earth and subdue it.

389
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,780
 "'Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky

390
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,980
 "'and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'"

391
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,980
 And so here it is, 28 verses into this book, okay?

392
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,940
 28 verses into this book.

393
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,300
 I don't know about you, but my guess is every single Bible,

394
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:54,420
 if you open it up, on the very first page,

395
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,580
 the very first page we see that God created sex.

396
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,900
 He created it.

397
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,620
 He wanted Adam and Eve, the first couple,

398
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,660
 to be fruitful and to multiply, to increase in number,

399
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,220
 to fill the earth with babies.

400
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,380
 And so you've gotta be sitting in there,

401
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,220
 and if you came in here

402
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,740
 and you've never heard about the Bible before,

403
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,540
 or you've never read the Bible,

404
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,540
 or you're just into this Jesus thing now,

405
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,420
 this has gotta be really good news to you,

406
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,580
 or very intriguing news.

407
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,140
 I mean, I know there's some of you guys out there

408
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,860
 that are sitting there going, "Really, first page?"

409
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,380
 Like, you know, you're putting on your to-do list,

410
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,380
 "Read more Bible right now," okay?

411
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,020
 It reminds me of when I first came on staff

412
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
 here at Watermark Dallas about seven years ago,

413
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,620
 I spent about a year leading our foundation group ministry,

414
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,180
 and the foundation group ministry

415
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,580
 is a small group for newly married couples.

416
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,220
 And it's a great ministry,

417
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,900
 and it was a lot of fun to lead it.

418
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,300
 And part of the foundation group ministry,

419
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,740
 what you do is you read through four books.

420
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,900
 And at the time when I was leading it,

421
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,860
 the books kinda changed,

422
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,660
 but they're all basically on the same subjects.

423
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,860
 And so it's kind of a biblical view of marriage,

424
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,860
 is one book, you read a book,

425
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,020
 or go through a resource on how to steward your finances,

426
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,660
 you read a book on communication,

427
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,180
 and then you read a book on sex.

428
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,140
 And so every time we would give those books

429
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,820
 to the married couples, to the newly married couples,

430
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,700
 it was amazing, there'd be a stack of books there,

431
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,580
 and the sex book was always the last book

432
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,980
 that you were to go through

433
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,460
 after you'd been in the group about a month,

434
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,700
 'cause it's a sensitive topic,

435
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,380
 and so you'd never really start with that book.

436
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,860
 You just go, "All right, read these in order,"

437
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,140
 and then the last book you'll go through is the sex book.

438
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,660
 And what I knew every time is that when those guys,

439
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,540
 those husbands, they got those books,

440
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,060
 they would drive home,

441
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,980
 and they would immediately just kinda look at their wife

442
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,860
 and just go, "I'm feeling like reading right now."

443
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,220
 And they would start with that sex book every single time.

444
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,460
 They were so intrigued by the sex book,

445
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,660
 and by like three weeks into the foundation group,

446
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,740
 they had already read the sex book

447
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,940
 because they were so intrigued by this topic,

448
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,140
 and it was basically what we see here in Genesis 1:28,

449
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,820
 is that they were just, like, God is into this,

450
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,340
 He created all of this.

451
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,660
 And so that means that it's not dirty,

452
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,820
 that means that it's good,

453
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,380
 that it is something that has been created by God.

454
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,260
 And so we see here in Genesis 1:28, all right?

455
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,100
 Now, let's keep going.

456
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,420
 The second thing that we'll see here

457
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,020
 is that not only did God create sex,

458
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,380
 but God also commands

459
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,740
 married couples to have sex.

460
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,180
 This is seen in 1 Corinthians 7, so look at this.

461
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,940
 1 Corinthians 7, verses two and three,

462
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,500
 and then we'll skip down and read verse five.

463
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,580
 "But since sexual immorality is occurring,

464
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,100
 "each man should have sexual relations with his own wife,

465
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,220
 "and each woman with her own husband.

466
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,140
 "The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife,

467
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,260
 "and likewise the wife to her husband.

468
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,460
 "Do not deprive each other, except perhaps by mutual consent,

469
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,220
 "and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer.

470
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,260
 "Then come together again, so that Satan will not tempt you

471
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,940
 "because of your lack of self-control."

472
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,980
 So the first thing we see is that God created sex,

473
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,980
 and so it's good, it's not dirty, it's a good thing.

474
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,180
 The second thing that we see

475
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,820
 is that God commands married couples to have sex,

476
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,980
 and this is really fascinating to think about.

477
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,900
 One of the reasons that he wants a married couple

478
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,620
 to engage in sexual activity

479
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,340
 is so that they can devote themselves to prayer,

480
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,020
 so that their minds will not be distracted,

481
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,540
 so that they can focus on praying.

482
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,740
 And so this good thing that God created,

483
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,900
 this good thing that he designed,

484
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,820
 he commands married couples,

485
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,460
 he commands them to be able to engage in this

486
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,420
 so that they can focus on their relationship with God,

487
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,980
 so that they can pray to him.

488
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,660
 The third thing we see here is that God deeply cares.

489
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,740
 He cares about sex,

490
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,180
 and he cares about sex in the right context.

491
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,260
 And so let's look here at Hebrews chapter 13, verse four.

492
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,260
 Here's what the author of Hebrews says,

493
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,700
 one of my favorite verses about all of it,

494
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,580
 because there's just so much in these few words

495
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,060
 to describe this biblical and godly view of sex.

496
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,140
 Here's what he says, "Marriage should be honored by all.

497
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,460
 "It should be honored by all,

498
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,240
 "and the marriage bed kept pure,

499
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,780
 "for God will judge the adulterer

500
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,700
 "in all of the sexually and moral."

501
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,820
 And so he wants this activity to be honored by all,

502
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,180
 and he wants this activity to be reserved for marriage.

503
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,100
 And so the bottom line that we see here,

504
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,180
 if we look at all of these,

505
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,540
 and then specifically what we see here

506
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,820
 in Hebrews chapter 13, verse four, is this,

507
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,820
 is that sex is a gift from God reserved for a married couple.

508
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,500
 Sex is a gift from God that is given to

509
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,060
 and reserved for a married couple.

510
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,820
 And so what we need to understand is it's not dirty,

511
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,620
 it's not something that he tells you not to do,

512
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,260
 it is a gift that he has given in the right context,

513
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,540
 and that is in the context of marriage.

514
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,740
 And so this idea of marriage or sex being a gift from God,

515
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,940
 I mean, this is something that I have got to remind myself

516
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,520
 over and over and over again.

517
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,980
 This is something that Jackie and I,

518
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,820
 the way that we're trying to communicate this to our boys.

519
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,100
 So I've got a seven-year-old and a nine-year-old,

520
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,380
 and we had the conversation with them

521
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,620
 before they started school last year

522
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,540
 of just wanting to be the first ones to describe sex to them

523
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,860
 so that they wouldn't have a snowman incident.

524
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,120
 So I'll never forget that night

525
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,740
 that we were having the conversation with them at dinner,

526
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,160
 and it was one of my favorite moments

527
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
 just because of the comedy that ensued

528
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,740
 as we were having that conversation with them

529
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,420
 and asking them, "Hey, have you ever heard of what sex is?"

530
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,680
 And they kind of look at us and they're like,

531
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,380
 "No, I don't know what that is, what is that?"

532
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,940
 And the very first thing we told them,

533
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 what we wanted them to know is that sex is a gift from God

534
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,040
 that is reserved for a married couple.

535
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,420
 And so they were like, "All right, well,

536
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,660
 "what is this gift for?"

537
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,580
 And we talked about, "Oh, this is where babies come from."

538
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,500
 And at that point, the kindergartner was just kind of like

539
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,340
 looking around like, "Where are babies coming from?

540
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,860
 "And how does that happen?"

541
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,580
 And you know, we're using this language,

542
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,780
 we're not talking about pleasure,

543
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,580
 we're just talking about the physical act with them,

544
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,220
 just trying to give them some vocabulary,

545
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,660
 something deep inside dad goes deep inside mom,

546
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,380
 and the seed from inside dad

547
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,820
 matches with the seed inside mom,

548
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,860
 and then a baby is born and the baby comes out.

549
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,180
 And at that point, I mean, the kindergartner is just like,

550
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,140
 "Can we please talk about something else right now?"

551
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,620
 And the first grader at that point,

552
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,100
 or the second grader at that point

553
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,740
 was just very intrigued by all of this

554
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,760
 and just kind of grossed out at the same time.

555
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,780
 And so we have to remind them,

556
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,180
 we've had multiple conversations with them about this.

557
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,140
 I mean, even as early as this Sunday,

558
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,500
 this Sunday, I went on a walk with my now third grader

559
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,180
 and he was talking about something

560
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,020
 in a song that he heard that maybe mentioned sex,

561
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,380
 and he talked about how sex was bad,

562
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,620
 and I just corrected him again to say,

563
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,580
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

564
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,220
 "remember, sex isn't bad.

565
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
 "Remember what we say,

566
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,260
 "sex is a gift from God reserved for married couples."

567
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,780
 If you're married, then sex is good.

568
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,860
 And what I love about this verse

569
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,220
 is that we're seeing the flip side of that,

570
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,300
 that context matters,

571
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,260
 context matters when it comes to whether or not

572
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,320
 God views sex positively or negatively.

573
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,960
 In the context of marriage,

574
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,640
 then sex is something that is to be richly enjoyed,

575
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,160
 but when you get out of the context of marriage,

576
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,980
 sex is something that Scripture is incredibly clear

577
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,820
 is deeply troubling.

578
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,020
 And you see it right here in this verse,

579
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,780
 "So the marriage bed should be honored by all,

580
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,180
 "the marriage bed kept pure."

581
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,460
 So that's in the right context of marriage,

582
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,860
 it should be richly enjoyed.

583
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,700
 But then God is going to judge,

584
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,120
 and then we see two words here to describe

585
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,700
 sexual activity that takes place

586
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,740
 outside of the context of marriage.

587
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,380
 God is going to judge the adulterer.

588
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,700
 An adulterer is somebody who has sex with somebody

589
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,500
 who is not their spouse.

590
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,400
 You have sex with another married person

591
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,300
 that is not your spouse, that's what an adulterer is.

592
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,260
 And that is viewed negatively here.

593
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,040
 And all the sexually immoral.

594
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,380
 And so sexual immorality,

595
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,040
 if you go and you read through the New Testament,

596
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,380
 that's one of the words that is used over and over again,

597
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,220
 and usually in a negative connotation to describe sex.

598
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,900
 What the author of Hebrews here is using,

599
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,240
 and Paul uses it, and again,

600
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,380
 it's all throughout the New Testament,

601
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,140
 when you run across the word sexual immorality

602
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,220
 or the sexually immoral,

603
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,380
 what that is in the original language,

604
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,580
 in the Greek language when the New Testament was written,

605
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,860
 that is the Greek word porneia.

606
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,980
 And that is where we get the English word pornography from.

607
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,980
 In your Bibles, it is translated sexual immorality.

608
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,320
 Sexual immorality or porneia, what it is,

609
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,820
 it's this kind of this junk drawer of a word

610
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,160
 that describes any and all sexual activity

611
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,240
 that takes place outside of the context of marriage.

612
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,160
 All of that is sexual immorality, it's all porneia.

613
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,500
 So this would be sex with your boyfriend or your girlfriend,

614
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,720
 oral sex, casual sex, masturbation, friends with benefits,

615
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,680
 pornography, raunchy films, strip clubs,

616
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,360
 all of that is porneia.

617
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,360
 It's all a cheap imitation of something that God designed

618
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,960
 and a gift that he gave for married couples.

619
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,280
 It's not the real deal, a cheap imitation.

620
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,440
 It's like turkey bacon.

621
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,000
 (congregation laughing)

622
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,040
 Like who cares, right?

623
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,240
 Like what's that worth?

624
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,960
 It's all porneia.

625
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,840
 In the context of marriage,

626
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,120
 in the context of marriage, sex is good.

627
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,420
 It's to be richly enjoyed.

628
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,160
 When you take it out of marriage,

629
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
 it can be deeply troubling.

630
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,260
 And so basically, the basics, what we need to know

631
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,760
 is we need to know this, is that you can trust,

632
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,460
 you can trust the designer.

633
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,720
 You can trust the designer.

634
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,060
 And you know what, we all know this is true.

635
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,320
 We get this, we experience things like this all the time.

636
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,640
 I mean, if you ever buy an appliance from Home Depot

637
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,800
 or from Lowe's, or you ever go buy a big piece

638
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,720
 of electronic equipment or something from Best Buy,

639
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,920
 you know, every time you go buy something from Home Depot

640
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,520
 or Lowe's or from Best Buy, and you get it home

641
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,480
 and you open it up, there are always instructions

642
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,840
 in that box telling you exactly how to use that dishwasher,

643
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,840
 how to use that refrigerator, how to use that DVD player,

644
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,200
 how to use that iPhone, or how to use any of those things.

645
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,320
 And the reason why the instructions are in that box

646
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,160
 and they don't come from Best Buy,

647
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
 and they don't come from Lowe's,

648
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,760
 and they don't come from Home Depot,

649
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,780
 is because those stores know that the designers

650
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,960
 of those products know the best information

651
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,100
 about those products.

652
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,560
 And so Home Depot doesn't want you calling them

653
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,080
 if you can't install the dishwasher,

654
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,300
 they want you calling the manufacturer

655
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,720
 because the designer knows best how to install that

656
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,840
 and knows best how to work it.

657
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,240
 And the exact same thing is true for us with sex.

658
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,160
 We can trust the designer.

659
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,520
 It's his idea, it's God's idea.

660
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,540
 So we can trust him.

661
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,920
 He's not trying to rip us off, he's trying to set us free.

662
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,920
 He knows the best way that this gift was intended to be used.

663
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,520
 And so the summary of the basics is this,

664
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,440
 is that we can trust the designer.

665
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,040
 Now, let's go and move on to the second movement here

666
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,160
 and the second act of all of this.

667
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,720
 And now let's start to think about some

668
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,840
 of the misunderstandings that are out there,

669
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
 'cause there were a lot of misunderstandings

670
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,120
 that I had about sex as I went through my miseducation,

671
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,160
 that I had to relearn or unlearn

672
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,520
 as I went through the reeducation.

673
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,280
 So again, we could be up here all night

674
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,900
 and talk about 20 or 30 misunderstandings

675
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,200
 and we just don't have time to do that.

676
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,000
 So let's just talk about three of them.

677
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,200
 And the first one that I wanna talk about is this idea

678
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,880
 that's out there that practice makes perfect.

679
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,200
 This idea that practice makes perfect is a misunderstanding.

680
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
 It is just not true.

681
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,240
 Now, I understand why many of us would think

682
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,520
 that practice makes perfect,

683
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
 because we are concerned about this thing

684
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,660
 that we like to call sexual compatibility.

685
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,520
 Sexual compatibility, that's one of the things

686
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,420
 that maybe some of you that are not married

687
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
 that you're worried about is,

688
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,800
 "Hey, if I get married and I'm gonna be monogamous

689
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,200
 and I'm gonna have a sexual relationship

690
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,360
 with just one person,

691
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,760
 I wanna make sure that I'm compatible with that person.

692
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
 So therefore I should probably practice

693
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,880
 or I should try before I buy here."

694
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,680
 And so I understand the reasoning behind all of that,

695
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,000
 but let me just remind you of something

696
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,080
 that I know you've heard from this stage multiple times.

697
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,160
 When it comes to sexual compatibility,

698
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,800
 you do not have to worry.

699
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,960
 If you are a man and you marry a woman,

700
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,620
 you are compatible sexually, okay?

701
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,520
 You're not just gonna be sexually compatible

702
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,720
 with one person.

703
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 You are sexually compatible with millions of people, okay?

704
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,160
 So you do not have to worry about sexual compatibility

705
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,400
 and use that as an excuse to engage in sexual activity

706
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,800
 outside of the context of marriage.

707
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,440
 And so sexual compatibility though,

708
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,820
 I think what a lot of us don't understand

709
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,280
 about sexual compatibility

710
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,660
 is that it doesn't have nearly as much to do

711
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,760
 with the physical side of the relationship

712
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,880
 as it has to do with the relational

713
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,120
 or the emotional side of the relationship.

714
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,480
 And so compatibility is mostly relational.

715
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 It's not mostly physical.

716
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,080
 And so I wanna prove this to you guys with some numbers,

717
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,560
 okay, so before I became a pastor

718
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,760
 and came on staff here at Watermark,

719
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,320
 I was a CPA for 10 years and so I love numbers.

720
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,280
 And so I was sitting there thinking about this one day

721
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,600
 and I just had this thought.

722
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,740
 And the thought was this,

723
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,840
 is how much time does the average married couple spend

724
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,640
 engaged in sex, okay?

725
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,480
 Like how much time?

726
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
 I know I had what my eighth grade dream was

727
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,920
 of how much time a married couple would spend

728
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,960
 engaged in sex and I was just sitting there going,

729
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,000
 all right, like how much time is it really?

730
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Like let's put some numbers down on the paper

731
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,840
 and let's look at it.

732
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,160
 So we were checking out some stats today

733
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,720
 about how many times the average married couple has sex.

734
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,040
 And so let's just for argument's sake today,

735
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,000
 let's say that the average couple

736
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,560
 engages in sexual activity six times a month, okay?

737
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,000
 Let's just say for argument's sake, six times a month.

738
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And let's say with those six times

739
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,480
 that every time the couple engages,

740
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,560
 let's say the entire process lasts 30 minutes, okay?

741
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
 Now, and when I say entire process,

742
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,880
 I mean like from brushing your teeth

743
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,480
 all the way to getting dressed again

744
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,240
 and going back and turning on the television, okay?

745
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,920
 Like the entire process lasting 30 minutes.

746
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,880
 So six times a month, six times a month,

747
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,760
 and if it's 30 minutes each time,

748
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,320
 that is 180 minutes a month, okay?

749
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,240
 Now, multiply that by 12 over a year

750
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,760
 and what that comes out to

751
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,760
 is that comes out to 2,160 minutes a year.

752
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:46,200
 Average married couple would spend engaged in sex, okay?

753
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,420
 Anybody know off the top of their head

754
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,440
 how many minutes there are in a year?

755
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
 Glad you asked.

756
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,320
 525,600 minutes, okay?

757
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,040
 You don't have to be a numbers person to know,

758
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,440
 you are not gonna like the answer to this, okay?

759
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,820
 So let's take this, let's do the math, all right?

760
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,320
 If the average married couple spends 2,160 minutes a year

761
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,640
 engaged in sex and there are 525,600,

762
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,560
 [congregation laughing]

763
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,860
 525,600 minutes in a year,

764
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,360
 what that means is this,

765
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,280
 that means that the average married couple spends

766
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,640
 0.41% of their year having sex.

767
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,620
 Now, let's just be generous

768
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,300
 'cause you guys are gonna be different, right?

769
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,120
 Let's just round that up.

770
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,080
 You all are gonna be different.

771
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,440
 Let's just round it up to 1%, okay?

772
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,560
 I'm giving you twice as much sex as the average, okay?

773
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,480
 So let's just imagine you're gonna have 1%.

774
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,540
 So if you can double the average,

775
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,780
 if you can double the average,

776
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,780
 you will spend as a married couple 1% of your year

777
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,160
 engaged in sexual activity.

778
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,260
 Let me show you another number.

779
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:10,260
 That means you will spend 99% of your life

780
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:17,140
 not having sex, okay?

781
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,940
 Sex, okay?

782
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,220
 Emphasis on not, all right?

783
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,460
 So here's what this means.

784
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,880
 Here's what this means.

785
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,940
 This means that sexual compatibility

786
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,480
 has a whole lot more to do with the 99%

787
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,420
 than it does with the 1% because it's relational.

788
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,420
 It's not merely physical.

789
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,520
 And what's crazy for me,

790
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,580
 and you guys can identify this,

791
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,600
 those of you that are not married,

792
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,040
 is that average dating couples,

793
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,880
 as a dating couple,

794
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,880
 it seems like you spend 99% of your time

795
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,600
 trying to avoid something

796
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,440
 that you will spend 1% of your time doing

797
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
 as a married couple.

798
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,160
 This is an incredibly important 1% of a relationship,

799
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,640
 but you better believe that that 1% is directly impacted

800
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,280
 by the quality of the 99%.

801
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,360
 Compatibility is not just a physical thing.

802
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,560
 Compatibility is a relational thing.

803
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,060
 And if you wanna be able to be compatible,

804
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,780
 then you better be focused on the 99%.

805
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,980
 So this idea that practice makes perfect

806
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,340
 really is not true at all.

807
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,580
 But, well, let me qualify that a little bit.

808
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,020
 There is one group where practice does make perfect,

809
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,980
 and that is when you get married.

810
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,700
 When you get married, practice does make perfect.

811
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,420
 And I got another kind of discouraging statistic for you.

812
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,600
 It's this, is that when researchers,

813
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,500
 marriage researchers,

814
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,460
 when they poll married couples

815
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,180
 and try to figure out which married couple,

816
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,380
 which age group is the most sexually satisfied,

817
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,060
 the studies consistently show

818
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,460
 that the most sexually satisfied couples

819
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,220
 are in their 50s and 60s.

820
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,100
 That's your parents' age, okay?

821
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,440
 (congregation laughing)

822
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,100
 So I'll just let you throw open your mouth for a second.

823
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,620
 (congregation laughing)

824
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,820
 Let's get over all that.

825
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,740
 (congregation laughing)

826
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,340
 Makes total sense to me, though.

827
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,300
 Makes total sense to me,

828
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,260
 because they're focused on the 99%.

829
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:23,300
 And you grow, and you continue to make progress in that.

830
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,880
 You don't bless your spouse with practice.

831
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,940
 You bless your spouse with purity.

832
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,260
 Because when you're pure, when you're pure,

833
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,100
 when you're avoiding sexual activity,

834
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,900
 you know what you're focused on?

835
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,920
 The relationship.

836
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,740
 The relationship.

837
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,260
 And when you're focusing on the relationship,

838
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,380
 you know what you're really focusing on,

839
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,020
 what's eventually gonna possibly help,

840
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,340
 is that's gonna help with compatibility.

841
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,060
 So the first misunderstanding that's out there

842
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,340
 for many of us is this idea that practice makes perfect.

843
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,960
 And what I want us to see as we're reeducating ourselves

844
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,380
 is that practice does not make perfect.

845
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,140
 Purity is what we are to do.

846
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,940
 The second one is this.

847
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,620
 Second misconception that's out there

848
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
 is that if we wait,

849
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,860
 if we wait, then sex will be great.

850
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,500
 This idea, if we wait, then sex will be great.

851
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,300
 And some of you, maybe if you grew up in the church,

852
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,460
 you have heard this, or you've believed this.

853
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,180
 Maybe this is what your youth pastor told you,

854
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,500
 or your parents told you, to try to convince you

855
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,980
 to remain pure, to remain a virgin.

856
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,600
 This idea that, hey, when you get married,

857
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,860
 if you're a virgin when you get married,

858
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,700
 then sex is going to be great.

859
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,180
 And I just wanna kinda bust that myth here

860
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,020
 to let you know this, that if you wait,

861
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,320
 that is not a guarantee that sex will be great.

862
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,660
 The worst year of sex for just about every married couple,

863
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,860
 the worst year of sex is the first year of sex.

864
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,080
 And it makes total sense 'cause if you're a virgin

865
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,580
 when you get married, then that makes sense

866
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
 that that first year of sex is going to be

867
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,860
 a little awkward and unusual,

868
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,440
 and you got all this vulnerability

869
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,320
 that you've gotta work through

870
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,700
 and how to communicate about this.

871
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,820
 And so that makes sense that it's gonna be work.

872
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,980
 But what's interesting is even if you've had sex before,

873
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,980
 that first year of sex is the worst year of sex.

874
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,480
 And the reason why is because just because

875
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,240
 you've had sex before you got married

876
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,240
 does not mean that you know what you're doing.

877
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,500
 Because if you've had sex before you've gotten married,

878
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,200
 you've been messing around with the cheap alternative.

879
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,340
 If you think just because you've had sex

880
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,140
 before you get married that that area of your life

881
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
 is gonna be perfect, that line of thinking

882
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,380
 is just as crazy as if my two boys when they turned 16,

883
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,580
 if they were gonna come up to me and go,

884
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,620
 "You know what, Dad?

885
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,020
 "We don't have to take driver's ed.

886
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,300
 "We think we know how to drive."

887
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,140
 And I'd be like, "Really?

888
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,960
 "Why don't you think you need to take driver's ed?

889
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,980
 "How do you know how to drive?"

890
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,040
 They go, "We got it.

891
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,380
 "We know how to drive.

892
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,300
 "We totally crush Mario Kart."

893
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,700
 All right?

894
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,540
 (congregation laughing)

895
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,780
 We totally crush Mario Kart.

896
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,860
 We finished in first and second place every time.

897
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,480
 We know how to drive.

898
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,020
 And so now I don't need to take driver's education.

899
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,200
 I just need to go take the test because I'm a good driver.

900
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,220
 That's crazy talk.

901
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,780
 Mario Kart is a cheap imitation of the real thing.

902
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,500
 And if they think they know how to drive

903
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,060
 just 'cause they can play Mario Kart,

904
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,300
 they're gonna be sorely mistaken

905
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,740
 when they get behind the wheel of a real car.

906
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,700
 And just because you've been messing around

907
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,260
 with the cheap imitation of the real thing

908
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,400
 does not mean you know,

909
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,700
 you know what this thing is that God intended.

910
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,240
 If you wait, it doesn't necessarily mean

911
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,140
 that sex will be great.

912
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,940
 I think if you wait, you're gonna be happy that you did.

913
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,240
 I think there's gonna be a lot less baggage

914
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,200
 that you're gonna be dealing with.

915
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,660
 I think there's gonna be a lot less guilt

916
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,160
 and a lot less shame.

917
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,780
 But don't wait.

918
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,280
 Don't wait just to put God on the line

919
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,680
 because maybe he owes you a good sex life.

920
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,120
 Wait.

921
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,840
 Wait as an act of trust and obedience in worship.

922
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,260
 Wait because you believe that God is good

923
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,460
 and that he is for you and he's not trying to rip you off.

924
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,400
 Don't wait because you think he's gonna owe you something.

925
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,840
 Wait for the right reason.

926
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,500
 And the last misconception that's out there

927
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,700
 is just this idea that marriage

928
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,540
 is gonna satisfy.

929
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:21,940
 That marriage is gonna satisfy your sexual desires.

930
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,640
 And unfortunately, that's not true either.

931
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,300
 And again, that line of thinking makes sense

932
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,340
 that, hey, I've got all these sexual desires right now.

933
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
 I've got this lust that I'm struggling with.

934
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,160
 I've got all these hormones that are going crazy right now.

935
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,980
 And the reason that I'm struggling with these desires

936
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,640
 is because I don't have a sexual outlet.

937
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,580
 Therefore, if when I'm married

938
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,860
 and I do have a sexual outlet,

939
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,420
 then those desires will go down

940
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,780
 and I'm not gonna struggle that much anymore.

941
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,700
 Makes total sense, that line of thinking,

942
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,500
 but I'm just telling you, it's not true.

943
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
 And the reason it's not true

944
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,420
 is because your sexual desires, that sex drive that's there,

945
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,980
 that lust, it's not a physical issue.

946
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,880
 It's a heart issue.

947
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,200
 And heart issues are not fixed by marriage.

948
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,720
 Heart issues are not addressed by marriage.

949
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,620
 Heart issues are fixed and addressed by Jesus.

950
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,340
 And so what we do right now,

951
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,900
 what we do right now while we're struggling

952
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,260
 is we believe what Paul said

953
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,900
 in the 1 Thessalonians 4, verses three and five.

954
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,260
 Look at this.

955
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,740
 He says, "It is God's will that you should be sanctified,

956
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,240
 "that you should avoid sexual immorality,

957
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,060
 "that each of you should learn to control your own body

958
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,300
 "in a way that is holy and honorable,

959
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,900
 "not in passionate lust like the pagans

960
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,460
 "who do not know God."

961
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,260
 If you can't control those desires and those urges

962
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,600
 and those lusts right now,

963
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,360
 then if you get married,

964
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,740
 you're gonna have trouble controlling them then too.

965
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,220
 Now is the time.

966
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,580
 Now is the time to start battling those urges.

967
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,460
 Now is the time to start battling those desires.

968
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:03,160
 Now is the time to work on your heart.

969
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:10,260
 And I am so grateful that God gave me these years up here.

970
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,200
 And I'm so grateful for this season

971
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,140
 when I was dating Jackie and trying to battle these desires

972
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,140
 and learning God's heart for sexuality

973
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,060
 and learning that He doesn't just say no,

974
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,800
 He's saying, "Hey, I want this to be done

975
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
 "in the right context."

976
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,460
 I am so grateful for those years

977
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,860
 when I was able to learn how to battle these desires

978
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,160
 and learn that these desires are not the ultimate in life.

979
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,540
 Because those are tactics

980
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,020
 and those are skills that I have had to use

981
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,740
 every single, just about every single day

982
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,940
 since I've been married.

983
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,700
 And so you learn to battle that stuff now.

984
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,540
 It makes me think about this.

985
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,020
 When my wife and I, when we first got married,

986
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,280
 one of our hobbies, because we had no kids and no pets,

987
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,240
 is that we ran marathons.

988
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,840
 And so we would train for marathons.

989
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,000
 And I remember the very first time

990
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,300
 we were training for a marathon,

991
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,080
 I thought that training for a marathon

992
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,560
 would make the running of the marathon easier.

993
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,000
 And it doesn't.

994
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
 The training for a marathon

995
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,300
 doesn't make the running of a marathon easier.

996
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,680
 When you train for a marathon,

997
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,640
 it is still really, really difficult to run

998
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,960
 26.2 miles in a row.

999
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,320
 The training for the marathon

1000
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,240
 didn't make the marathon running easier.

1001
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,700
 The training for the marathon

1002
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,860
 got you more mentally prepared

1003
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,260
 for the running of the race.

1004
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,100
 You knew what it was like to feel

1005
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,060
 or you knew how it felt

1006
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,500
 when you were starting to run low on fuel.

1007
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,720
 You knew how it felt

1008
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,840
 when you needed to take a break and walk.

1009
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,120
 You knew how it felt

1010
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,320
 when mentally you were starting to get discouraged.

1011
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,100
 And so you had trained for those moments

1012
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,140
 so that when you faced them,

1013
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,340
 you had all the skills you needed

1014
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,940
 to be able to battle those.

1015
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,320
 And this idea that marriage

1016
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,240
 is gonna satisfy all of those urges

1017
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,320
 is just false now.

1018
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,080
 This is when you start to work on it.

1019
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,920
 So these misunderstandings really

1020
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,600
 can be summarized this way,

1021
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,960
 that it's not about practice makes perfect,

1022
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,060
 it's not about wait

1023
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,600
 and that's gonna make sex life great,

1024
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,440
 and it's not that,

1025
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,760
 hey, I'm just waiting until I get married

1026
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,220
 and then all these urges and desires

1027
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,060
 are gonna go away.

1028
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,940
 The way that we could summarize

1029
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,200
 the right way to look at this

1030
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,960
 is to pursue purity.

1031
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,040
 That's what this season is for.

1032
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,520
 So I don't know what your miseducation looked like

1033
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,960
 or what reeducation you need.

1034
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,840
 I don't know if you had similar instances

1035
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,680
 like I did

1036
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,720
 or you're in the middle

1037
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,520
 of going through your reeducation right now,

1038
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,960
 but for every single one of us,

1039
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,780
 what we need to do

1040
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,840
 is we need to be able to trust the designer

1041
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,640
 and understand that marriage is a gift from God

1042
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,480
 or excuse me,

1043
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,300
 sex is a gift from God

1044
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,200
 reserved for married people

1045
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,880
 and we can pursue purity

1046
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,800
 in this time right now

1047
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,000
 when we are not married.

1048
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,400
 And so I'll close with this last story,

1049
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,040
 this last weekend,

1050
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,480
 my family and I,

1051
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,280
 we went camping with our community group.

1052
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,360
 There were five couples and 17 kids.

1053
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,240
 We went over to Mineral Wells State Park

1054
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,920
 and I'm not a camping guy,

1055
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,000
 I'm not an outdoor guy.

1056
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,320
 So there's a lot of things

1057
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,640
 that I do not like about camping.

1058
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,760
 I've never been able to sleep in a tent.

1059
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,080
 My wife and I realized this weekend

1060
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,020
 after another sleepless night in our tent

1061
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:15,340
 that we have spent many more hours awake

1062
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,320
 inside of our tent

1063
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,560
 than we have asleep inside of our tent.

1064
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,800
 And so camping is very difficult for me

1065
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,040
 because I get tired

1066
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,760
 and I'm not sleeping well.

1067
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,560
 It's dirty,

1068
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,400
 it's hot,

1069
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,960
 there are bugs all over the place.

1070
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,320
 I noticed this weekend

1071
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,160
 that I just kind of give up on life

1072
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
 when I'm camping.

1073
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,040
 I don't change my clothes,

1074
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,920
 I don't brush my teeth,

1075
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,820
 I like, I don't comb my hair.

1076
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,400
 I'm just like, what does it matter?

1077
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,240
 We're out here in the wild right now.

1078
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,520
 I'm gonna get dirty again.

1079
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,820
 My wife, before she went to bed,

1080
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,940
 she's like, I'm gonna go wash my face

1081
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,780
 and brush my teeth.

1082
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,620
 And I'm like, why?

1083
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,580
 What does it matter?

1084
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,080
 And I just give up on life when we're there.

1085
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,720
 I just, I don't like camping

1086
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,540
 and that's a whole nother issue.

1087
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,140
 But there is one part of camping

1088
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,980
 that I really do like

1089
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,820
 that is my favorite,

1090
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,180
 one of my favorite things to do in life

1091
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,720
 and that's at night

1092
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,000
 after the 17 kids go to bed

1093
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,160
 and all the adults are around.

1094
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,040
 What I love doing

1095
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,320
 is I love getting around the campfire.

1096
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,220
 There's just something mesmerizing about it.

1097
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,020
 So you sit around the campfire

1098
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,860
 and it's amazing.

1099
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,680
 You got the fire there

1100
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,100
 and it's just interesting to watch

1101
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,180
 and you can cook, make the s'mores

1102
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,340
 and just seems like around a campfire,

1103
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,800
 there's, you're never short of conversation.

1104
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,920
 It's always something to say.

1105
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,660
 The conversation is great.

1106
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,740
 The warmth is there.

1107
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,940
 It brings people together

1108
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,900
 and it's just an awesome experience.

1109
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,900
 And so as I was looking at our campfire this weekend,

1110
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,600
 the thought just kind of dawned on me

1111
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,640
 that right now this campfire is contained.

1112
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,380
 There's these stones all around here

1113
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,340
 and that campfire is right there

1114
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,580
 and we're all gathered around it

1115
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,580
 and it's providing warmth and life for us

1116
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,060
 and we're making these s'mores

1117
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,460
 and we're having great conversation

1118
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,300
 and we're all around it.

1119
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,620
 It's great.

1120
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,300
 But if that fire moved,

1121
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,300
 if it moved just a few feet over to the right,

1122
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,940
 if it went up just a little bit higher

1123
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,040
 and caught that tree,

1124
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,580
 you take that thing that is so contained right there

1125
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,420
 in that fire pit

1126
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,900
 and brings so much joy and so much life.

1127
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,780
 If you take it

1128
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,500
 and you move it out of its context,

1129
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,900
 it could reap just so much destruction so quickly.

1130
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,180
 If you guys saw the headlines,

1131
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,940
 this is what's going on out in California right now.

1132
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,380
 Out in Sonoma and Napa Valley right now in that area,

1133
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,600
 I wrote down some stats of what's going on there right now.

1134
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,460
 These fires are going crazy out there right now.

1135
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,560
 Right now they've consumed,

1136
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,840
 as of about five o'clock today,

1137
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,960
 they've consumed an area

1138
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,580
 that's three times the size of Washington, DC.

1139
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,220
 This fire is moving at a rate

1140
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,780
 where it's moving 300 yards in about three seconds.

1141
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,180
 That's how fast it's moving.

1142
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,700
 Over 20,000 homes have been destroyed.

1143
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,420
 15 people have lost their lives in this fire.

1144
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,180
 It's amazing that fire is this thing

1145
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,740
 that when it's in the right context,

1146
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,060
 when it's in a fireplace or it's in a campfire,

1147
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,900
 it's in a fire pit,

1148
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,460
 can provide so much life, so much joy,

1149
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,220
 provide warmth and bring people together.

1150
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,300
 But if you take it out of its context,

1151
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,300
 it can cause destruction, it can cause damage,

1152
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,260
 and it can ruin lives and leave scars.

1153
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,600
 And the exact same thing is true about sex.

1154
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,620
 In the right context, in marriage,

1155
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,700
 it can be this beautiful thing

1156
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,620
 that can draw people together,

1157
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,180
 it can draw a husband and wife together,

1158
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,840
 that can bring new life,

1159
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,420
 something where you can enjoy

1160
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,700
 this deep intimacy with one another.

1161
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,740
 And it's amazing when it's in the right context of marriage.

1162
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,260
 But when you take it out of the right context,

1163
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,420
 when you take it out of marriage

1164
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,460
 and it involves sexual immorality or it involves adultery,

1165
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,340
 it's damage, just like fire.

1166
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,340
 It destroys lives, it destroys people's paths,

1167
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,720
 and it leaves an unbelievable scar on so many.

1168
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,700
 We can trust the designer and we can pursue purity, amen?

1169
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,640
 Amen, let me pray for us.

1170
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,840
 God, thank you so much

1171
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,760
 for the gift that you have given.

1172
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:30,320
 And God, we recognize that although sex is a great

1173
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,880
 and an amazing gift that you have given to married couples,

1174
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,520
 it is nowhere close to the ultimate gift.

1175
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,820
 And that ultimate gift is the gift you gave us

1176
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,360
 in your son, Jesus Christ.

1177
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,020
 And so I thank you, Lord.

1178
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,100
 I thank you for Jesus.

1179
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,020
 I thank you that we can be forgiven

1180
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,180
 and that we can be redeemed.

1181
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,820
 And I thank you, Lord,

1182
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,860
 and because he has risen,

1183
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,260
 that we now can pursue purity in this season,

1184
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,420
 that we can trust you in this season,

1185
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,960
 that we can follow your path,

1186
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,380
 and we do not have to follow the ways

1187
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,100
 of the world on this subject.

1188
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,820
 So God, I pray for my friends in this room.

1189
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,460
 I pray that they will reject the lies that they have heard.

1190
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,560
 I pray for my friends that still need some more reeducation,

1191
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,060
 that you will bring people into their lives,

1192
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,540
 that your word will speak into their hearts

1193
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,780
 and that it will help them as they are reeducated,

1194
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,100
 to have the right and proper view of this amazing gift

1195
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,660
 that you've given to humanity.

1196
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,360
 And so God, we thank you.

1197
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,140
 We can come together and then we can talk about this

1198
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,340
 and that your word guides us and instructs us.

1199
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,940
 And so we need help and we ask for it.

1200
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,120
 And we ask this in Jesus's name, amen.
