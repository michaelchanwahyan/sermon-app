00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:24,840
 >> Well, hey Dallas, it's great to be with you tonight.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,640
 My name is Garrett.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,040
 If we've never met before, I wanna give a shout out to my Fort Worth family,

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,520
 where I spend most of my Tuesday night missing you guys this evening.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,220
 Also to anybody that's dialed in through the porch app online or

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,240
 gathered in your city to experience the porch this evening.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,920
 So glad that you guys are with us.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,920
 Hey, I wanna catch you up on some news if you missed it.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,960
 48 hours ago in the country of Pakistan,

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,760
 on Sunday, an oil tanker disaster happened.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,000
 So this is an 18-wheeler oil tanker carrying about 5,000 gallons or so of oil.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,400
 And it turns over and starts gushing into the street.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,200
 And here's the thing about oil, it's valuable anywhere.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,440
 It's valuable in Texas, it's valuable in Pakistan.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,000
 It's worth money, it's liquid money, it's pouring out everywhere.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,280
 And all of a sudden, as soon as this disaster starts to happen,

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,720
 the word gets out that liquid money, aka oil, black gold as they call it,

19
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,240
 is leaking out everywhere all over the street by the thousands of gallons worth.

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,600
 And one of the local mosques there in Pakistan starts to broadcast

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,760
 over their speaker that they normally use for a call to prayer,

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,600
 starts to broadcast that oil is in the street.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,880
 And so everybody starts to grab buckets, they grab cans, they grab cups,

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,000
 everything that they can possibly grab for the goal of grabbing some of that oil.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,600
 Because that could be a life-changing event, right?

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,360
 So everybody rushes forward to enrich themselves on what has just happened.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,800
 And unfortunately, if you haven't read, it ignited and blew up.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,680
 And over 150 people, over 150 people and counting,

29
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 have lost their lives in the literal pursuit of wealth.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,400
 The actual action of wealth.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,880
 And the world says, "Get rich or die trying."

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,640
 Get rich or die trying, go get what you can.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,760
 Get rich or die trying.

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,280
 And these people tried to get rich and they literally died.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,120
 So on that note, we're gonna begin the porch.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,360
 Welcome, so glad you're here.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,400
 So kind of a somber start.

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
 The apostle Paul, the apostle Paul in 1 Timothy chapter six

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
 is going to beg you, beg you tonight, warn you.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
 He's gonna pull out all the stops.

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,320
 You're gonna hear him say crazy, crazy warnings.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,100
 He's gonna pull out all the stops to convince you

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,220
 that get rich or die trying might be the most dangerous advice

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,520
 that you have heard yet.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,040
 And so 1 Timothy six is where we're gonna start.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,300
 And here is the challenge.

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,720
 If you can hear my voice right now,

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,560
 you probably are in the wealthiest country

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,960
 in the history of the world.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,880
 If you're in the same room with me right now,

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,440
 then you're in one of the most materialistic cities,

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,260
 for sure by reputation in that country,

53
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,200
 in the history of the world.

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,120
 That's where we're at.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,440
 And we are so accustomed to everybody just having a bucket

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,400
 and filling up everything that they possibly can

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,860
 as frantically as they can, that we don't even notice.

58
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,320
 We don't even see where we are.

59
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,460
 We don't even see what's going on

60
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,800
 because we're immune to it.

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
 But this is what we do.

62
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,980
 We pursue wealth.

63
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,280
 It's natural for all of us.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
 It's the American dream.

65
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
 It's what we do.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,320
 And I wanna tell you, I'm a struggler tonight.

67
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,560
 I don't, this is not an area

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,280
 that I claim to have conquered.

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,420
 I wanna read and interact with the text with you tonight,

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,760
 but this is not a place

71
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,400
 that I would call a strong suit for me.

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,880
 I would much rather hustle and get on a grind

73
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,680
 and earn a dollar than I would to chill

74
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,940
 and be content with what I have.

75
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,960
 And so this text is particularly challenging for me.

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
 I want you to know that,

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
 but I think it's appropriate for us all to admit

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
 as we get started tonight,

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,360
 that pursuing wealth is more natural to us than we think.

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,480
 This is why, this is why some of you

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
 have not been at a job longer than 12 to 18 months,

82
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,520
 because as soon as somebody offers

83
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
 like 3,000 more dollars a year,

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
 you're like, boom, gone.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,200
 Like, I don't need to hear anything else.

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,560
 Don't need to read a job description.

87
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,880
 Give me the cash and I'm good, right?

88
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,240
 Some of you like make dating decisions based on this.

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,320
 You know, it's like, okay, well,

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,800
 we don't have that much fun together.

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,400
 And he, I think he kind of knows Jesus.

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,320
 He's at least heard of Jesus,

93
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,940
 but he's in medical school, winner.

94
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,160
 All right, big deal.

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,040
 All right, and so you're like completely

96
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,680
 wrapping your life around the pursuit of wealth

97
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,900
 and you don't even realize it.

98
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,440
 And some of us, when we daydream,

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
 oh man, this is me.

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
 When we daydream, sometimes the daydream

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,540
 starts to look less about who you're with.

102
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,880
 You know, oh, when I'm 50, when I'm 60, when I'm 70,

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,920
 I wanna be with my family.

104
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,440
 I wanna be with my brothers and sisters,

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
 my wife, my husband, my grandkids.

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
 It stops looking like that and it starts to sound like

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,360
 this is where I'm gonna live, you know?

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
 This is what I'm gonna have.

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,580
 This is what I'm gonna live in.

110
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,080
 This is the right address I'm going to have.

111
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,040
 This is the kind of car I'm gonna drive.

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,920
 And all of a sudden, your dreams and hopes and plans,

113
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,320
 and as you picture life later

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,040
 when you're living it down the road,

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,140
 all of a sudden it becomes more about what you have

116
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,980
 than who you're with.

117
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,800
 We think materially instead of relationally.

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,720
 It's just natural to us.

119
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,540
 That's what we do.

120
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,760
 Some of you can't complete a purchase

121
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,320
 without already thinking about the next one.

122
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,200
 This is me.

123
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,760
 Oh man, we bought a house.

124
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
 I got married 10 months ago.

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,480
 We bought a house and as we did,

126
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,420
 four months later we remodeled the shower.

127
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,200
 The house was built in 2014.

128
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
 We don't need to remodel a shower.

129
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,600
 That's ridiculous.

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
 Now we barely closed the papers

131
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,860
 and I'm looking for ways to improve this thing.

132
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,880
 It's embarrassing.

133
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
 All right, that was my authentic moment for the evening.

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,880
 And so we are, we naturally are moving toward wealth

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
 and we don't even realize it.

136
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,360
 We are embarrassingly rich.

137
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
 And I don't think God wants us to feel guilty about that.

138
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,520
 But I do think he wants us to be careful about that.

139
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,960
 And get rich or die trying is a bad advice

140
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,900
 that may make for a great 50 cent debut album,

141
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,120
 but it is not gonna help you very much

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
 in your walk with Christ, all right?

143
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,880
 So we're gonna get started.

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
 First Timothy six, all right?

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
 Verse three.

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,780
 If anyone teaches a different doctrine,

147
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,260
 it's not gonna sound at first like he's teaching on money,

148
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,100
 hang with it.

149
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,660
 If anyone teaches a different doctrine

150
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,020
 and does not agree with the sound words of Jesus

151
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,940
 and the teaching that accords or fits with godliness,

152
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,900
 then he's puffed up with conceit and he understands nothing.

153
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,520
 In other words, if you disagree with Jesus,

154
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,860
 then you have a conceit problem.

155
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,680
 And part of the problem for these particular people

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,100
 that Paul has in mind is that they imagine

157
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,200
 that godliness is a means of gain,

158
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,400
 that their Christianity is going to make them rich,

159
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
 that if they can be godly or faithful,

160
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,860
 that somehow their bottom line is gonna actually

161
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,800
 and materially move in kind of a one-to-one relationship,

162
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,180
 in kind of a push-pull relationship.

163
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,120
 If I'm godly, then I will be wealthy.

164
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,000
 And if you ever hear that message,

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,240
 then you need to turn the TV off

166
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,840
 because that is not what God's word teaches.

167
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,060
 It says right here that imagining that godliness

168
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,920
 is a means of gain is a mistake.

169
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,860
 But in verse six, it says,

170
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,120
 "Godliness with contentment is great gain."

171
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,440
 Godliness with contentment makes you already rich.

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,280
 If you're godly today and you're content today,

173
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,500
 then you are rich today.

174
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,020
 Now that's a huge claim.

175
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,860
 That's a big claim.

176
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,460
 I don't know about you, but that kind of makes my mind go,

177
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,980
 "Ah, are you sure?"

178
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,820
 'Cause last time I checked,

179
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,580
 my mood doesn't really change my bills.

180
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,420
 You know what I mean?

181
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
 And so if I feel content or if I feel happy

182
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,440
 or if I feel peaceful or if I'm godly or not,

183
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,900
 I still got the bills, I still got income,

184
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
 I still got to do the whole financial thing.

185
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,860
 And so how and why would he get away with a crazy claim

186
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,300
 like godliness with contentment is great gain?

187
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,860
 And here's why, it's pretty obvious.

188
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,540
 Verse seven, "For we brought nothing into the world."

189
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,960
 For is like a because word right there.

190
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,900
 "Because we brought nothing into the world."

191
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,860
 That's why godliness with contentment is great gain,

192
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,540
 because we brought nothing into the world

193
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,960
 and you can't take anything with you out of this world.

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
 Death is the end of the road.

195
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,240
 And so the first reason,

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
 Paul's gonna give us two warnings tonight,

197
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,120
 two warnings and an instruction,

198
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
 two reasons why get rich or die,

199
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
 trying is bad advice and then some instruction.

200
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
 And the first warning is this,

201
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,260
 you are guaranteed to lose your money.

202
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,480
 The death statistics are impressive, 100%.

203
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
 (congregation laughing)

204
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,440
 There will be a day when you have nothing.

205
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,800
 Billy Graham said, "I have never seen a hearse

206
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,740
 "pulling a U-Haul."

207
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,560
 You are not ever, you are not ever going to be able

208
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,120
 to get anything out of this world, okay?

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,320
 You are guaranteed to lose your money.

210
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,600
 That's true just by experience.

211
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,480
 It also says in the scripture in Hebrews chapter nine,

212
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,520
 "It's appointed for man to die once."

213
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,360
 So it's appointed for you to die, that's going to happen

214
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,840
 and you're gonna lose everything you have.

215
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,660
 Death is the great equalizer.

216
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,280
 You might be a rare kind of rich.

217
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,720
 You may be a rare kind of rich, right?

218
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
 The kind of person that people just wanna be around

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,040
 because it might go better for them.

220
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,540
 But on the day of your funeral, your net worth will be zero.

221
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,240
 Not a single thing will you have.

222
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,280
 This is a really practical reason why get rich or die trying

223
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,340
 is really bad advice.

224
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,960
 Because the best you can actually do

225
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,420
 is get rich and then die.

226
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,200
 That's the best you can do.

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,240
 Nobody can outrun that.

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,080
 You can't outlive that.

229
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,600
 No amount of money can overcome that law.

230
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,460
 You can get rich and then die.

231
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,560
 That's all you can do.

232
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,840
 You might've heard of John D. Rockefeller before.

233
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,580
 John D. Rockefeller was considered to be maybe

234
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,880
 the most wealthy American in the history of our country.

235
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,960
 He was an oil and philanthropist magnet essentially.

236
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,500
 And his worth, at his peak in today's dollars

237
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,080
 would have been over 350 billion.

238
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,400
 300, three, five, zero, nine zeros.

239
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,120
 That's how much wealth this man had

240
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
 at the peak of his wealth.

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
 You might've heard the story before they asked him,

242
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,260
 "Hey John, how much is enough money?"

243
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,200
 And he said, "One more dollar."

244
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,220
 You might've heard that.

245
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
 But you might not have heard this.

246
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,160
 At his funeral, someone kind of edged up

247
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,360
 to John Rockefeller's accountant.

248
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,200
 And he said, "Hey, how much did he leave?"

249
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,900
 The accountant said, "All of it."

250
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,080
 (congregation laughing)

251
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,120
 What do you mean how much did he leave?

252
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
 100% of it.

253
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,920
 There's nothing about John Rockefeller

254
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,680
 that is going with him into the next life.

255
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,640
 Now he left a mansion for his family.

256
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,680
 He left Rockefeller Center in New York City.

257
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,720
 Some of you have been there.

258
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,520
 And so he left things behind in this world

259
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,880
 because of his wealth.

260
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,320
 But he did not take anything with him out of this world.

261
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,280
 Ecclesiastes 2.21.

262
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
 This is not gonna be the most encouraging verse

263
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
 you've ever heard, I'm gonna warn you.

264
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,100
 "For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge, and skill.

265
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,560
 "And then they must leave all they own to another

266
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,300
 "who has not even toiled for it.

267
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,220
 "This too is meaningless and a great misfortune."

268
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,360
 Let me translate that.

269
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
 You can get on your grind for 60 years

270
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,460
 and they're gonna throw you a 30 minute retirement party.

271
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,520
 Everybody's gonna clap for you.

272
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,720
 And then you're gonna die and your spoiled nephew

273
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,540
 is gonna get your money

274
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,080
 and they didn't do anything to deserve it

275
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,640
 except to be born into your family.

276
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,380
 This is a great misfortune, says Ecclesiastes 2.

277
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,540
 Whoever dies with the most toys still dies.

278
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,100
 That's what it says in 1 Timothy 6, 7, paraphrase.

279
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,060
 If you think, yeah, well, if I'm gonna die,

280
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,680
 I mean, I know the way our minds can get around

281
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,520
 this kind of thing.

282
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,220
 You think, well, if I'm gonna die,

283
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,240
 sometime I still got a life to live between now and then.

284
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,840
 So if I'm gonna die and it's gonna go to zero,

285
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,960
 I guess I might as well have a lot

286
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,440
 between now and the time I die.

287
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
 Paul knows that some of you think that way.

288
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,220
 And that's why he is gonna turn up the heat a little bit

289
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,060
 on the next warning.

290
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,320
 Look at this in verse eight.

291
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
 "But if we have food and clothing,

292
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,120
 "with these we will be content."

293
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,160
 Try living that one out.

294
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,120
 "But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."

295
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,800
 And now listen to the vocabulary he reaches for

296
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,100
 when he starts to warn about the danger

297
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,500
 of wanting to be rich.

298
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,620
 "But those who desire to be rich fall into a temptation,

299
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,060
 "into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires

300
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,840
 "that plunge people into ruin and destruction.

301
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
 "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils."

302
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,740
 That's a pretty popular misquoted verse right there.

303
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,240
 You ever heard money's the root of all evil?

304
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,080
 You ever heard that?

305
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,900
 Money's the root of all evil.

306
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,240
 Bible says that money's the root of all evil.

307
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,840
 The Bible doesn't teach that.

308
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,520
 It doesn't say that money is the root of all evil,

309
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,440
 as if you just see some evil out there.

310
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,400
 And if you follow the path back to where it began,

311
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,520
 money's behind it all.

312
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,560
 That's not what the Bible says.

313
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,680
 It doesn't say every evil in the world out there

314
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,800
 is because of money.

315
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,480
 What it does say is that if you fall in love with money,

316
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
 you will become capable of any kind of evil.

317
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,760
 If you fall in love with money,

318
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,120
 you will surprise yourself with what you're capable of.

319
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,000
 "The love of money is a root of all kinds of evils."

320
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,160
 Anything can come from this thing.

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,160
 It's through this craving that some have wandered away.

322
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,420
 From the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.

323
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,480
 Pierced themselves with many pangs.

324
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,920
 Money is a gateway drug.

325
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,400
 If you fall in love with money,

326
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,320
 who knows what you'll love next?

327
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,480
 You might start to love respect.

328
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,600
 You might start to love power.

329
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200
 You might start to love position.

330
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,240
 Maybe one day you'll love money enough to steal some of it.

331
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,080
 Maybe next you'll love it enough to cheat on your taxes.

332
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,760
 Maybe one day, according to this,

333
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,880
 you'll even wander away from your faith.

334
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,960
 And you think that's crazy.

335
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,080
 There's no way that I would do that.

336
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,560
 But that's just the point.

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,440
 Is if you fall in love with money,

338
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,680
 you don't know how crazy you're gonna become.

339
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,000
 That is the danger of falling in love with money.

340
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,640
 So my second point is this.

341
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,560
 Loving money is self-destructive.

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,360
 Loving money is self-destructive.

343
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,000
 Suicidal to your faith.

344
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,720
 If you fall in love with money,

345
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,600
 you are destroying your faith.

346
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,820
 They work together.

347
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,940
 You can have money.

348
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,280
 God, I mean, it says right there,

349
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,120
 we have food.

350
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,020
 We have food and clothing.

351
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,860
 We'll be content.

352
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,840
 So you're gonna need some amount of money

353
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,380
 to have food and clothing.

354
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,220
 God knows that.

355
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,800
 God's not calling you to hate your money

356
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,420
 or to pretend that you can operate in the world

357
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,880
 without some measure of money.

358
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,400
 He is telling you that you cannot love money and love God.

359
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
 Jesus said, related to this topic,

360
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,160
 you cannot serve both God and money.

361
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,840
 No one can serve two masters.

362
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,220
 And if you think you can, he's not your master.

363
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,480
 You can't serve God and money.

364
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,080
 And if you fall in love with money,

365
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,360
 then your faith just jumped into the rear view mirror

366
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,800
 of your life and you were headed a different direction.

367
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,160
 Another story came out this week of a jeweler.

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,400
 This one is crazy.

369
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,120
 Of a jeweler who claimed to have hidden some jewels

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,640
 and gold in New Mexico, in the mountains, okay?

371
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,240
 Now, my first reaction when I hear that is not,

372
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,160
 hmm, I wonder how many mountains are in New Mexico

373
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,840
 and I wonder if I could somehow search them all

374
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,900
 and find the jewelry, okay?

375
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,640
 Or whatever the treasure is out there.

376
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,800
 But are you ready for this?

377
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 Two people in the last five months have died in New Mexico,

378
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,760
 in the mountains, looking for jewelry

379
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,040
 because a man claimed that he hid it there

380
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,880
 for alleged jewelry.

381
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,400
 Now, I don't know what's crazier.

382
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,280
 The fact that those people went after some kooks jewelry

383
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,440
 in the mountains of New Mexico,

384
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
 or if part of you are on your phone on Google right now

385
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,160
 looking up flights to New Mexico,

386
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,040
 trying to figure out, you know,

387
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,120
 like, oh, my aunt lives out there.

388
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
 You know, we could stay with her.

389
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,660
 This is gonna go great, you know?

390
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,500
 This will drag you into a pit.

391
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,100
 This will drag you away from God.

392
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,020
 There is no way that you can cultivate

393
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,220
 the kind of love relationship with God that you want

394
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,780
 and love money at the same time.

395
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
 It's not possible.

396
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,980
 Paul's telling you, you will self-destruct.

397
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,660
 Galatians 6 says, "God is not mocked.

398
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,400
 "You will reap what you sow.

399
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,700
 "And if you sow to your flesh, you'll reap destruction."

400
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,040
 I can trace this in my life.

401
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,260
 I've been alive 28 years.

402
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,100
 It's not a long time,

403
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,320
 but I've loved a lot of things that aren't God.

404
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,760
 I can remember times I needed, I felt like I needed,

405
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,680
 I wanted new Nikes.

406
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
 I can remember wanting a new fishing pole.

407
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,480
 I can remember wanting my dad to take me out to play ball

408
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,360
 or go to the Rangers game.

409
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
 I can remember wanting a new house.

410
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,880
 And I can tell you this,

411
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,080
 not a single thing has satisfied my soul except Jesus Christ.

412
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,560
 And I know this, that when I love anything other than Him,

413
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,280
 when I pursue anything other than Him,

414
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,760
 there is an interruption.

415
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,580
 It is not a both and when it comes to our loves.

416
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,700
 Now here's something important to see.

417
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,260
 I don't want you to miss this.

418
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,160
 Nowhere in that text does the Bible demonize money, okay?

419
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,960
 Nowhere in the text does it talk about dollar amounts.

420
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,180
 It doesn't say you have to have a minimum amount of money

421
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,220
 to be a Christian.

422
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,860
 It doesn't say you have to stay under a maximum amount

423
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,460
 of money to be a Christian.

424
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,620
 It doesn't say that.

425
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,000
 There are no dollar signs.

426
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,480
 It is talking directly to your heart's posture.

427
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,320
 Do you see that?

428
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,660
 Look at these words right quick.

429
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,700
 In verse nine and verse 10, it says,

430
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,820
 "Those who desire to be rich fall into temptation."

431
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,780
 It doesn't say those who are rich

432
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,940
 are automatically in a temptation.

433
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,780
 It doesn't say that.

434
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,620
 Whether you have money or whether you don't

435
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,460
 is not the issue.

436
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,600
 It's what do you love.

437
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,420
 Those who desire to be rich.

438
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,660
 Look in verse 10, "The love of money."

439
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,060
 I'm not saying money's the root of all evil.

440
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,700
 It says, "The love of money, the human response to money

441
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,420
 is a root of all kinds of evils."

442
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,640
 Through this craving, there's another heart word.

443
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,840
 It's through this craving.

444
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,480
 Not through the having of money,

445
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,240
 but through the craving of money.

446
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,980
 And if your heart, if your heart gets wrapped

447
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,960
 around this thing, that is what will lead you away.

448
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,320
 God is not calling you to hate your money.

449
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,620
 He is the one who gives it to you.

450
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,840
 Later, the text will say to enjoy.

451
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,760
 Focus your hope on God who gives you everything to enjoy.

452
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,480
 And so he doesn't want you to hate it

453
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
 and he doesn't want you to love it.

454
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,480
 He wants you to use it.

455
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,080
 So the guy who stands up and says that God wants Christians

456
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
 to be financially poor is just as wrong

457
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,000
 as the guy who stands up and says,

458
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,820
 "God wants all Christians to be financially rich."

459
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,100
 There's nothing in the text that mandates a dollar amount.

460
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,400
 You just need to see that.

461
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,280
 The problem is not that you have any amount of it.

462
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,420
 The problem is if any amount of it has you.

463
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,860
 That's the issue in the text.

464
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,380
 Hop down to verse 17.

465
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,300
 It says, "As for the rich in this present age,"

466
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,860
 and I'm just gonna pause right there for a second.

467
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,480
 This is a unique opportunity.

468
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,900
 The Bible is about to coach rich people.

469
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,740
 So this is an interesting opportunity

470
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,580
 that you're about to see.

471
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,420
 This is unique, okay?

472
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,040
 I don't know off the top of my head

473
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
 anywhere else in the scripture

474
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,660
 that God actually takes the time to say,

475
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,660
 "Hey, and if you're rich, do this."

476
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,680
 David down here is probably like,

477
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
 I got like three references for you

478
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,120
 that you've totally forgot about.

479
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,380
 But I can't think of any other

480
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,960
 off the top of my head right now

481
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,440
 that involve God actually coaching rich people.

482
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,360
 Okay, so here it comes.

483
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,400
 "As for the rich in this present age,

484
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,740
 "charge them not to be haughty."

485
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,880
 Don't be prideful.

486
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,120
 Don't set your hope on the uncertainty of riches.

487
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,880
 What an irony, since we think that riches

488
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,400
 is what is gonna secure us.

489
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,600
 We think that money is what's gonna make our boat

490
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,560
 go straight and everything go smoothly, right?

491
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,320
 And it is too volatile for that.

492
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,680
 But on God, don't focus on the uncertainty of riches,

493
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,440
 but on God, who richly provides everything to enjoy.

494
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,280
 There's a relief.

495
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,300
 God's not calling you to sell everything you have

496
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,400
 automatically just because you come to the faith.

497
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
 And you go, wait, didn't Jesus tell a guy,

498
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,920
 "Sell all you have, give it to the poor,

499
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
 "and then follow me."

500
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,200
 Yes, he did, because he knew

501
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,640
 that's what that person's heart needed.

502
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,540
 And if you're afraid of that, man,

503
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,240
 maybe that's what you need.

504
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
 But I know this, God does not mandate

505
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,120
 a uniform dollar amount that everybody's gotta come under.

506
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,700
 What he mandates is that you love him and not your money,

507
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,800
 and he will take care of the rest.

508
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,280
 Every dollar you have is a gift from God,

509
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
 and he's in charge of it.

510
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,460
 Verse 18, "They," meaning the rich in this present age,

511
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,580
 "They are to do good, to be rich in good works,

512
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,460
 "to be generous."

513
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,300
 Be ready to share.

514
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,200
 Don't be ready to collect.

515
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,320
 Don't be ready to get things.

516
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,480
 Be ready to share something.

517
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,240
 "Storing up treasure for yourself,"

518
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,920
 storing up treasure for themselves,

519
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,880
 "as a good foundation for the future,

520
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,680
 "so that you may take hold of that which is truly life."

521
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,980
 You have an eternity ahead of you.

522
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,600
 You're gonna spend forever somewhere.

523
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
 That's for sure.

524
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,140
 You're gonna spend forever in a place, awake.

525
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,420
 That's where you're gonna be.

526
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,320
 And how full your life is there

527
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,660
 depends on how empty you can make it here.

528
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:50,720
 Paul's instruction tonight is be rich in good works.

529
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,940
 It's the third point, straight from the text in verse 18.

530
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,940
 Be rich in good works.

531
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,980
 Now this is hard for us,

532
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,740
 because we are all rich on a global scale, all of us.

533
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,980
 Now I know you don't feel rich.

534
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,060
 I know you probably don't wanna think of yourself as rich,

535
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,540
 because that could come with some sort of a responsibility.

536
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,060
 But I want you to know, on a global scale,

537
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,660
 you are probably, if you can hear my voice right now,

538
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,700
 you are probably rich.

539
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,880
 And so let me give you two resources,

540
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,620
 just so you know I didn't pull that out of thin air.

541
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,100
 One would be the Bible.

542
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,300
 So that was just a couple of verses up,

543
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,100
 where it says, "With food and clothing, we'll be content."

544
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,540
 And so if you have food and you have clothing,

545
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,300
 and then anything on top of that, you have extra.

546
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,820
 So if you have more than enough food,

547
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,620
 and you have more than enough clothing, congrats.

548
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,700
 You are rich, man.

549
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,900
 You are rich.

550
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,100
 In 1 Timothy 6 terms, if you have more food,

551
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,060
 if you have more than food and clothing you need for today,

552
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,200
 then you are officially rich.

553
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
 But if you wanna look at something

554
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,940
 that is objective in the sense

555
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,980
 that it looks at the whole world statistically,

556
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,180
 then I would invite you to go to globalrichlist.com.

557
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,700
 Globalrichlist.com.

558
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,060
 And you can find out, you just type in, it's super easy.

559
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,900
 You type in your name,

560
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,260
 and you type in what your income is,

561
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,580
 and you hit start, and get ready to be embarrassed,

562
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,340
 all right, by how much wealth you have,

563
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,420
 and how difficult it is for the rest of the world, okay?

564
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,940
 So I'm just gonna assume safely tonight that we are rich.

565
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,360
 And it's saying be rich in good works.

566
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,460
 And I think we may be the worst rich people ever.

567
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,220
 Like imagine what a good rich person would like.

568
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,200
 Can you get that person in your mind?

569
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,760
 Like what would a good rich person be like?

570
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,140
 I'm assuming that they would be fulfilled.

571
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,420
 I'm assuming that they would be relaxed, right?

572
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,140
 They're rich, how do you have a bad day?

573
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,700
 Just relax, right?

574
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,140
 When you envision a good rich person,

575
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,980
 you probably assume that they are relaxed,

576
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,180
 at peace, and generous, right?

577
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,020
 They're ready to share.

578
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,700
 They're exactly what 1 Timothy 6 says they should be.

579
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,500
 But we have got a nation of rich people.

580
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,420
 This is, America is Disney World to the rest of history,

581
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,620
 not just to the rest of the globe,

582
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,760
 but to the rest of history.

583
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,460
 And we are the worst rich people in history.

584
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,300
 Depression rates have skyrocketed

585
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,020
 as America's wealth has continued to rise.

586
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,740
 We are not good at being rich.

587
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,580
 We are not good at this thing of having wealth.

588
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,380
 It's like we're worried about going hungry

589
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,740
 and we live in a permanent Thanksgiving.

590
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,460
 It's like, somebody wake up and see what's going on.

591
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,140
 We are not good at being rich.

592
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,180
 And the text says right here, if you will do good,

593
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,140
 if you will be rich in good works,

594
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,620
 okay, this has to do with other people.

595
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,700
 This doesn't have to do with you.

596
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,580
 To be rich in good works, be generous,

597
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,220
 and ready to give something, and you will store up,

598
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,280
 get this, treasure for yourself

599
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,700
 as a good foundation for your future.

600
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,100
 Now, I don't want you to miss what that means.

601
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,700
 When it says for the future, it does not mean on earth.

602
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,820
 Okay, God is not guaranteeing that if you put dollars in,

603
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,460
 God is going to give you dollars back.

604
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,620
 He could work that way.

605
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,980
 He can do whatever he wants.

606
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,660
 But if anyone teaches that you,

607
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,460
 if you will just give your cash,

608
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,860
 God will give the cash back to you.

609
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,500
 You know, if you need that 10,000,

610
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,300
 just drop that 100 in and watch God work.

611
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,020
 Anybody who says that,

612
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,000
 that as if they know that God is going to give you

613
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,320
 material earthly currency, they are off.

614
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,120
 This guarantee is in the future.

615
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,060
 That's why it says for the future,

616
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,160
 so that you can take hold of that,

617
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,840
 which is truly life giving.

618
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,980
 And real riches aren't what you have.

619
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,940
 It's who you serve.

620
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,440
 That's one of the reasons why I love serving

621
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,080
 at the porch in Fort Worth.

622
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,100
 I love it because I get to be around people

623
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,120
 who have decided, you know what, this is not gonna be,

624
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,640
 my life on earth is not gonna be,

625
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,360
 my few minutes on earth before all of my stuff is gone

626
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,020
 are not gonna be about what I can collect.

627
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,600
 They're gonna be about what I can give.

628
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,720
 And we've got a group of people over there

629
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,160
 from every occupation you can possibly imagine.

630
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,280
 All right, we've got nurses,

631
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,480
 we've got oil and gas landmen,

632
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,960
 we've got students, we've got teachers,

633
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,240
 we've got physicians assistants,

634
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,880
 physicians assistants students.

635
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,240
 There's like nine hospitals in Fort Worth

636
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,080
 or something crazy.

637
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,440
 I mean, it's just huge all in a big clump.

638
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,780
 So it's like a ton of medical.

639
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,480
 And so we've got people all over the place

640
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,320
 from every occupation.

641
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,000
 I don't know what a single one of them makes,

642
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,840
 except my wife.

643
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,560
 I don't know what a single person on our team makes.

644
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,720
 I know this, they have decided to be rich

645
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,200
 in the way they live their life.

646
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,100
 They have decided to give away their lives

647
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,360
 for the sake of Christ, for the sake of the gospel.

648
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,240
 They have decided that they wanna be rich

649
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,920
 instead of endlessly trying to get rich.

650
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
 They've decided, you know what,

651
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,000
 what I wanna do is I wanna live a life

652
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,880
 that is consistent with what this book says.

653
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,680
 And with what the book says is to be generous

654
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,080
 in the way that I handle other people,

655
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,200
 be ready to share, not ready to collect.

656
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,380
 And I don't know what life is gonna look like in heaven,

657
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,160
 but I suspect for them it's gonna be really good.

658
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,260
 And the same for you if you're doing this.

659
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,080
 And the Bible promises you'll be rewarded.

660
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
 And some of you, I know, you just go,

661
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,800
 man, I don't wanna be generous to be rewarded.

662
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,100
 But the Bible says you're gonna get one anyway,

663
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,200
 even if you don't want one.

664
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,700
 'Cause God's good in that way.

665
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,360
 So in summary, don't pursue wealth

666
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,320
 because you're guaranteed to lose your money.

667
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,400
 Don't pursue wealth because your loving of money

668
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
 is self-destructive.

669
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,060
 And then lastly, be rich in good works.

670
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,300
 Be generous to other people,

671
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,040
 and you will be a good, rich person for a change.

672
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,600
 'Cause 1 Timothy 6 has a word for you

673
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,780
 and what to do with all your wealth.

674
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,500
 And even if you don't think you have it.

675
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,160
 And I know some of you maybe have been sitting there,

676
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,040
 I should've said this earlier,

677
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,240
 but some of you may be sitting there going,

678
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,040
 you know what, I'm not trying to get rich, man.

679
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,840
 I'm just trying to get out of debt, amen.

680
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,560
 You know, like I'm not trying to get rich, dude.

681
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,840
 Like I'm just trying to get out of debt.

682
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,020
 I just wanna tell you, I get debt.

683
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,960
 I have found myself in debt.

684
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,960
 Medical debt, private school education debt, twice, okay?

685
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,560
 Yeah.

686
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,280
 House, car, the whole deal, man.

687
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,180
 Like I have been under a mountain of debt.

688
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,480
 And I wanna tell you, sprinting to get a dollar of debt

689
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,160
 off the books is the same thing as sprinting

690
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,140
 to get a dollar of income on the books

691
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,240
 because it's hope in wealth.

692
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,940
 You gotta handle things responsibly, not obsessively.

693
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,460
 Paying debt obsessively is the same thing

694
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,120
 as going to get income obsessively.

695
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,000
 Trust God and be rich.

696
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,300
 Stop trying to get rich and just be rich.

697
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,800
 We're gonna give you a chance to do that next week.

698
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,080
 So next week, we're not gonna gather in this place, all right?

699
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
 So here in Dallas, we will not have a porch.

700
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,140
 Let it be known, we will not have a porch

701
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,160
 in the traditional sense next Tuesday night.

702
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
 In Fort Worth, we will not have a porch

703
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,800
 in the traditional sense.

704
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,660
 If you show up to either one of those two places,

705
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,920
 you'll be very patriotic and you'll be very alone.

706
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,860
 So do not come to the porch next Tuesday night.

707
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,960
 What we are gonna do is we are gonna allow you,

708
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,620
 we're not gonna take on the red, white, and blue.

709
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,560
 We know you got plans.

710
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,060
 And so here's what you can do.

711
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,080
 Be bold where you are.

712
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,940
 Have the most generous 4th of July you've ever had.

713
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,080
 That means picking up a meal, pick up a meal.

714
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,540
 But I know what this, I know what we want it to include.

715
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,960
 Generosity with your time, generosity with your intention,

716
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,920
 or with your attention, with the way you focus.

717
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,080
 Put your phone down and pay attention

718
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,640
 to your family for a minute, you know?

719
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,920
 Go with your friends and get into their lives a little bit.

720
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,700
 Talk to them, and especially, especially,

721
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,760
 look for your opportunity wherever you are,

722
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,280
 whatever environment you go into on the 4th of July,

723
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,700
 whatever environment you go into,

724
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,040
 look for a chance to be bold about the Savior

725
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,600
 who really set you free.

726
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,360
 And that's why we're gonna hand you,

727
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,760
 if you need some help with that, if you need a prop,

728
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,240
 what we're gonna do is we're gonna hand you one of these.

729
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,160
 Okay, and so this is a red, white, and blue band.

730
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,320
 It says, "Be bold on it," okay?

731
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,820
 And so let that be a reminder to you,

732
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,360
 wherever you are, that when you see that,

733
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
 you want to move yourself toward a bold conversation,

734
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,400
 not hanging out at the lake, drinking Natty Light,

735
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,440
 all right, stay away from that, that ain't gonna help you,

736
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,200
 all right, but a sense of intentionality, okay?

737
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
 A sense of urgency, a sense of,

738
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,200
 I'm gonna live my life in front of you

739
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
 maybe different than I ever have before,

740
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,080
 and I want to show you who it is

741
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,960
 that has caused me to live in this way.

742
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,020
 The most generous way that you can spend

743
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,800
 the Fourth of July is to share with someone

744
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,360
 the hope that you have in Christ,

745
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,800
 the freedom that you have in Christ.

746
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,500
 Ask somebody if they have a faith.

747
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,400
 Ask somebody if they've been to church.

748
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,740
 Ask somebody if they'll just listen to your story.

749
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,180
 If they're not comfortable engaging in a thing,

750
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,680
 I know some of you are like, oh no,

751
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,400
 this is the stuff I hate, I can't talk to people like this.

752
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,200
 The introverts' knees are like shaking right now.

753
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,880
 I'm telling you, just ask someone

754
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,320
 if they'll listen to your story,

755
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,360
 and then you can just share the way Christ has saved you.

756
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,240
 That is our hope.

757
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
 Every one of you in Dallas and Fort Worth

758
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
 are gonna get one of these,

759
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,640
 and you hang onto it for next week.

760
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
 Wear it on the Fourth of July,

761
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,960
 and celebrate the United States.

762
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,860
 I love it, I'm a patriot, but I'm telling you what,

763
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,560
 I'm not loyal to the United States

764
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,100
 above my relationship with Christ, not even close.

765
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,480
 And so make that day an opportunity

766
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,960
 to be rich in the real way.

767
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,200
 Let's pray together.

768
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,640
 Father, my prayer this evening, our prayer this evening

769
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 is that you would launch a group of young adults

770
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,880
 into the city by the hundreds, by the thousands, God,

771
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,400
 that you would raise up a generation,

772
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,020
 continue to raise up a generation that will speak boldly,

773
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,160
 they'll be bold, they won't be sidetracked

774
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,080
 by the customs of the day, by the holidays of the day,

775
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,400
 but God, we will live a generous lifestyle

776
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,700
 in the way that we engage with those around us.

777
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,560
 God, help us to stop bowing down to the almighty dollar,

778
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,620
 God, we don't wanna spend 50 more years chasing money

779
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,120
 and then coming face to face with you

780
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,240
 and wondering why another day,

781
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,740
 another dollar sounded better.

782
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,500
 God, when we see you at the end of our life,

783
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,560
 when all of our net worth just falls to the ground,

784
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,600
 we wanna know that we were rich on earth

785
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,240
 in the way you said, God,

786
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,960
 not in the way Dallas or Fort Worth said,

787
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,820
 not in the way Houston said, not in the way America said,

788
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,160
 but in the way you said, God, we were generous,

789
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,040
 we were ready to share,

790
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,340
 we were ready to share our hope in Christ,

791
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,000
 we were ready to share a defense for the faith

792
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,500
 and the hope that's within us.

793
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,020
 God, preserve our faith by helping us turn back now.

794
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,840
 Corporate America is not worth us bowing down to.

795
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,600
 God, help us to stop resisting church membership

796
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,140
 because we're trying to get a career launched.

797
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,880
 Help us just to go in where you want us to go.

798
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,480
 We're not good at being rich, God,

799
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,760
 you've given us material wealth

800
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,600
 and we're not good at it, God,

801
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,040
 and so we ask you for spiritual wealth

802
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,720
 and we wait for you, in Jesus' name, amen.

803
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,720
