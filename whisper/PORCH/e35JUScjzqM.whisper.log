[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.800]   - Well, what's up Porch?
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.000]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.620]   Hey, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.780]   Welcome to the Porch.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.160]   My name is Timothy Atik,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.640]   and I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   on Sundays as well as here on Tuesday nights.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.520]   I do wanna give a shout out
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.220]   to all of our Porch Live locations watching tonight.
[00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.280]   I'm looking at you Midland, Tulsa, Boise.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.360]   I'm so glad that you're tuning in with us tonight.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.960]   Would y'all say hello to my good friend, Jenny Allen,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000]   who's with us tonight.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400]   Hey, so here's the deal.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.520]   If you are just jumping in for the first time in a while
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.840]   here at the Porch, we have been in a series
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.440]   on the topic of prayer.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.180]   And the whole goal of the series has been
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.180]   to help us gain traction in talking to and hearing from God.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.440]   And Jenny came and joined me
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.000]   on the first night of the series,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.680]   and we, that was a voice crack.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.460]   I just hit puberty yesterday.
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820]   It's going super well so far.
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.680]   But on the first night of the series, four weeks ago,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.280]   Jenny jumped in and we had a great conversation
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.160]   around prayer and it just felt right
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.800]   to bookend the series, having Jenny come back.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.680]   If you haven't been tracking with us,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.800]   Jenny, you wanna say hello?
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.600]   I'm just talking and you're there.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.440]   - I'm good.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.680]   It is so good to be here.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.040]   Y'all, we're gonna cause trouble tonight.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.240]   We don't totally have a plan for all of this.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.920]   Can I just give a little hint?
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920]   - Sure.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.080]   - We're gonna pray tonight.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.920]   (congregation cheering)
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920]   Isn't that good?
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.620]   So creative.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.080]   - Yeah, I mean, we were talking about it.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   It was like, okay, we'd been doing a series on prayer,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.440]   but we haven't really prayed.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.880]   So it felt right for us to,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.440]   as we're doing a series on prayer,
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.320]   to actually pray together.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.840]   So we're gonna do that in just a little bit.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.000]   But before we do that,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.040]   I felt like one of the best things I could do
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.040]   is take you to these couple verses in the Bible
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880]   that I think will really set us up for tonight.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.840]   I want you to turn in your phones to Matthew 21.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.160]   And I just wanna look at verses 12 and 13 very quickly,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.980]   because it has everything to do
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860]   with where we're going tonight.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.500]   The fact that we are going to spend
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.400]   a little bit of time praying together,
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.900]   these couple verses will show us
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.200]   why we are going to do that.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.520]   And it's a story in the Bible
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.800]   about Jesus cleaning out the temple.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Here's what it says in Matthew 21, verses 12 and 13.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.720]   It says this, "And Jesus entered the temple
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.660]   "and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple.
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.000]   "And he overturned the tables of the money changers
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   "and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.260]   "He said to them, 'It is written,
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.160]   "'My house shall be called a house of prayer,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.920]   "'but you make it a den of robbers.'"
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.440]   So here's why I wanted to start there, Jenny.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.140]   I feel like it's a great place for us to start,
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.140]   because we wanna be people who value the presence of God.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.400]   Like we wanna believe,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.660]   and I know you believe this firmly in your life,
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.440]   that our God is a personal God,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.320]   that he wants to meet with us.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.280]   So when we step into this place at the porch,
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.360]   we believe God is here.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.920]   He wants to meet with us.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.640]   He wants to speak to us.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   In the temple, in the Bible,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.600]   it was the place where God's presence dwelt.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.560]   Like it was a very special place.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.680]   The temple had a special room inside of it,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.320]   known as the Holy of Holies,
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.160]   where the presence of God filled that one room.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.700]   And only one person once a year
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.520]   was allowed to enter that room.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.960]   And he would enter that room
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.120]   with a rope tied around his ankle
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.920]   in case he died when he was in there meeting with God.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.000]   People could pull him out
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.840]   without having to go in after him.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.560]   And so you have the temple,
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.660]   which is supposed to be the place
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.800]   where the presence of God resides,
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.600]   and the people of God are supposed to come
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.940]   and worship him and meet with him.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.720]   But Jesus shows up, and what's going on?
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.440]   There's people who are selling animals in God's house.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.240]   There's sheep and cows and pigeons
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.320]   roaming around God's house.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.160]   And not only that,
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.880]   there's people inside of the temple
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.320]   who are exchanging money.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.080]   Why is that happening?
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.760]   Well, people would come to the temple
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.500]   to offer sacrifices to God.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.200]   So the reason that they're selling animals
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.000]   is because there are people from all over the Roman Empire
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.720]   who are coming to offer sacrifices to God.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.200]   So they're doing people a favor
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.360]   so that they don't have to drag their sheep
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.000]   across the Roman Empire.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.880]   They can just show up and buy one.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.560]   And the reason that they're changing money
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.060]   is that there was a temple tax
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.120]   that every male over the age of 20 was supposed to pay,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.280]   and there was only one currency that was accepted.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.000]   But you had various currencies
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.720]   from around the Roman Empire that were coming.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.800]   And so they offered that they would exchange money.
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.440]   The issue is not that animals were being sold
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.120]   or that money was being exchanged.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.960]   What was the issue?
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.760]   The issue was where they were doing it.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.200]   They were doing it inside of God's house,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.800]   which was supposed to be the place
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.080]   where people met with God.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.920]   Let me ask you,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.160]   have you ever had your quiet time in Walmart
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.220]   on Good Friday?
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.680]   No?
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.080]   What about at a petting zoo?
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.400]   Have you ever taken your Bible
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.720]   and had a quiet time at a petting zoo
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.640]   or at the State Fair of Texas?
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.640]   Probably not.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.120]   Why?
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.860]   'Cause that's not the most conducive environment
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.640]   to meet with God.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.400]   The issue wasn't what they were doing.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.320]   The issue is where they were doing it.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.360]   One commentator said this,
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.440]   "Instead of solemn dignity in the murmur of prayer,
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.760]   there is the bellowing of cattle in the bleeding of sheep.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.280]   Instead of brokenness and contrition,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.740]   holy adoration and prolonged petition,
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.320]   there is noisy commerce."
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.120]   So here's the most fascinating thing,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.400]   and this is why I bring this up
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.800]   just to frame what we're about to do.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.900]   The crazy thing is that the presence of God
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.600]   had long departed from the temple,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.960]   and it was just business as usual
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   for the people who were supposed to be the people of God.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.320]   Like they had lost all awareness of the presence of God.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.900]   Instead of valuing presence,
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.700]   they valued convenience and attendance.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.160]   We don't wanna be those people.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.660]   We wanna be a people who values the presence of God.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.840]   We wanna be people who show up tonight
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.160]   believing God is here, and he wants to meet with us.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.160]   Jesus says, "My Father's house is a house of prayer."
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.200]   Jesus wanted the temple, the house of God,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.980]   if it was known for one thing,
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.860]   Jesus wanted it to be known for prayer.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.760]   Now, this is the final thing that I wanna,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.360]   this is the final point that I wanna make.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.120]   This is the most important part.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.260]   Don't miss this.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.080]   What's interesting is the temple
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.360]   that was the house of God where the presence of God
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.960]   was supposed to reside,
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.840]   listen to what Paul says in the book of 1 Corinthians.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.400]   He says, "Do you not know that you,"
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.960]   and in the Greek, you is plural.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   So he's talking to the people of the church.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.480]   He's saying, "Do you not know that you are God's temple
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.220]   "and that God's spirit dwells in you?"
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.440]   So here's what I need you to do.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   I need you to put Matthew 21
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.320]   and 1 Corinthians 3 together.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.840]   1 Corinthians 3 says that you, in fact, now are the temple,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.000]   that we, the people of God, the church,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.040]   are the temple where God's presence resides.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.880]   What does Matthew 21 say?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.140]   It says God's house should be a house of prayer.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.720]   The temple should be referred to as a house of prayer.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.600]   It should be known for prayer.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   So if you pair that with 1 Corinthians chapter three,
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.400]   what do we find out? That we, the people of God,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.400]   the temple of God now, should be known for prayer.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.520]   So that's why we wanna be a people tonight
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.040]   who gather together and pray.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.640]   - So I don't know how you're feeling when you hear that,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.540]   that we're gonna pray tonight.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.220]   Some of you, I imagine, are here and you aren't a believer
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.540]   and you haven't prayed ever or very often in your life.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.320]   And I just wanna say, this is a really safe place
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.360]   to not know what you're doing,
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.280]   that you're not gonna experience any judgment
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.880]   or anything that should make you uncomfortable.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.480]   This should feel easy.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.400]   And if you just want to be quiet, it's okay.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.680]   But I would say to those of you
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   that don't yet know God or trust Christ,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.080]   that talking to Him is an awesome thing to do.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   And asking Him, "Hey, if you're real,
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.260]   I would love to know you,"
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.700]   to talk to Him in a way that is honest and real.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.140]   That is what we're going to do tonight.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.500]   We're going to be honest and real.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.380]   And so I actually wanna begin this night
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.460]   by you getting really comfortable.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.460]   So if that means you spread out, get on the floor,
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.060]   whatever you need to do, just move around.
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.820]   I want you to get in a different location
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.220]   and posture than you're in now.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.380]   So move around.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.260]   Good luck.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.420]   Spread out.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.480]   Make a new friend.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.740]   - Huh, yeah.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.900]   (audience chattering)
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.060]   (audience chattering)
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:11:02.580]   - All right.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.440]   Here's how we're gonna start.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.500]   I want you to close your eyes.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.880]   And we're just gonna be quiet for just a minute.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.900]   I want you to close your eyes,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.540]   and I want you to think about your feet on the ground
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.060]   or where you're sitting.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.320]   I want you to think about your breath.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.620]   I want you to remember that God is with you,
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.900]   but you are also with many people who love him.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:51.740]   And I wanna begin with just as honest as you can be,
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.340]   you in the quietness of your heart,
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.520]   expressing to God how you're doing with him.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.900]   What is your relationship like?
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.500]   I want you to be honest about it.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.900]   I want you just to tell him.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:27.700]   Likely, in the last 15 seconds,
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:31.380]   your attention was hard to focus.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.780]   It was hard to focus on prayer.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.120]   And I wanna tell you, do not judge that.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.500]   Just every time that your attention wanders off,
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.300]   just gently bring it back.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.780]   Now I want you to express to God
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.300]   what you want your relationship with him to be.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.460]   (silence)
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.620]   (silence)
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.780]   (silence)

[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.100]   (silence)
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.260]   (silence)
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.420]   (silence)
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.580]   (silence)
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.740]   (silence)
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.740]   And I want you to ask him what he thinks about you.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.900]   (silence)
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.060]   (silence)
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.220]   (silence)
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.380]   (silence)
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.540]   (silence)
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.700]   (silence)
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.860]   (silence)
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.020]   (silence)
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.180]   (silence)
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.340]   (silence)
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.180]   What are some of the things that you've heard?
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.300]   You can yell them out.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:40.400]   (indistinct)
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.800]   (indistinct)

[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.000]   (indistinct)
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:47.600]   So Father, we enter this night in the safety of your love for us.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.400]   And we thank you that you have provided the means for us to be right with you.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.400]   And wherever we are, we can come to you.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.200]   We don't have to make everything right about us.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   We don't have to keep our attention perfectly focused on you.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.600]   We don't have to even have nice things to say to you.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.400]   We can just come to you.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.000]   Thank you.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Now we're gonna turn our eyes to God.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.200]   And I want us to just thank him for who he is.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.800]   That's how we're gonna begin.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.200]   So we're gonna do that corporately because it's so special that we can
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.000]   and say these things out loud to God.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So God, you are kind.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.600]   I want you just to speak out and even wherever you are listening from,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   if you're in a location with other people,
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   I think speak out the words to each other.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.000]   And let's just pray and thank God for who he is.

[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   God, you are all of these things,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   all of the words that are being thought and said in the room.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   God, you are beyond these words,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   thousands of them being spoken at the same time.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   You are different than us.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   We can't imagine your holiness and your goodness and your kindness,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   and yet you set your eyes on us.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Thank you.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And we know because the scripture tells us that you care for us
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   and that you want us to make our requests known to you.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   So God, would you bring to mind the things that we need,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   the things that the people we love need?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And as God brings those things to your mind,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   I want you to share with two or three people around you,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   and then I want you to pray together over those things.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And if that is not comfortable for you, it's okay.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Just say, "I'd rather not pray out loud."
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   But I would encourage you to pray together,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   two to three of you right now,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   for the things that are on your heart.

[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And so that's what we're doing right now.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   We're just acknowledging what we need, and we are asking you to provide it, Lord.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And so what a joy it is to be able to bear one another's burdens and to pray for one another now.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   And we thank you that you hear our prayers, and we thank you, God, that our lives are safe in your hands,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   that you know what we need.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Just as you met the Israelites' needs every morning, that there was always man awaiting,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   we pray that you, God, would provide for whatever was just spoken in this place.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I pray that you would provide it in your kindness and in your perfect way.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Here's what I want to do now.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I just want to ask you guys to be honest as much as you're willing,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   but I would imagine that there are people in this room who would say, "Yeah, life is really tough right now."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Maybe you feel like you're in the midst of a dark place or just in the midst of a trial,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   what you hoped your life would be right now and what it actually is are very, very far apart.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   So if you're going through a trial right now, if life is hard, if something is hurting,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   would you slip up your hand real quick so we know who that is?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And here's what I want to ask you to do.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I want to ask you to leave your hand up, and if you look around and you see someone with their hand up,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   if you're willing, would you just come around them and ask them their name?
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And what we want to do is we want to pray for them.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And you can even take a moment and share if you feel comfortable and just say,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   "Would you pray for this? Would you pray for my mom who has cancer?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Would you pray that I could find a job quickly?"
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Whatever it is, share that real quick.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And then what I want to ask you guys to do is to pray out loud for one another.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And if you're not around someone who has a hand lifted up, that's okay.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Would you pray for them out loud?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Would you pray for the people who are hurting in this room?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Take a moment and do that.

[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Pray for those who feel suicidal.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Pray for those who have a loved one who is battling cancer.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Pray for people who desperately need a job.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Pray for those who have gone through a breakup and are dealing with a lot of heartache.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Just pray for those who are dealing with hurt and pain right now.

[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Psalm 40 says, "I waited patiently for the Lord.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   He inclined to me and heard my cry.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust."
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Lord, I do pray for every person in this room who is hurting right now.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I thank you that there is not one person in this room who has to hurt alone.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Lord God, that you see into the darkest places of our lives.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   You know the thoughts that have been had in this room of taking their own lives.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Lord, you know the people who have despaired, who feel lonely,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   who feel anxious or depressed.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Lord, you know those who have lost a loved one.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Lord, you know those who have parents who are going through a divorce right now.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Those who are having to navigate all sorts of complexities
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   in a friend's situation or something at work.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Lord, I just thank you that you are a God who is near to the brokenhearted.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   God, I pray that you would put a new song in people's mouth.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   I pray that you would put people's feet on solid ground.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   For those who feel hopeless, I pray that even right now as I'm talking,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   they would sense you breathing hope into their souls.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Lord, I thank you that you deeply love each one of us and that you're with us.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   David says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I will fear no evil for you are with me."
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Thank you that you are with us, even in the toughest moments of life.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   I want to take just a minute and make some observations of some things
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   that are happening in the room.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   This isn't something we do all the time together.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   And one of the things that just happened is you were the priesthood of the believers.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   You owned your place.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   You believed that a pastor didn't have to pray for that person,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   that you could pray and pastor that person.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   And that is a weapon that God has given us into your hands.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   He has given you a weapon, and it is the weapon of prayer.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And we don't believe how powerful it is because we don't believe how powerful our God is.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   We don't know that he really is listening.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   But whether you're in your workplace or on the side of the road
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   or with a checkout person or with a waiter, you can pray for people.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   You can be this for people.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Doesn't it feel powerful?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   All of you that just got prayed for, is that not the greatest gift?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Such a gift, yes.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And we get to go give that away anytime.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   So, we're going to move into a time of confession.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   You knew we were going to go there.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   If I didn't get excited, here's why.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Because, T.A., there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   That is true.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It is true.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   And if it is true, then this is the safest place in the world to say your sin.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   But before we get to that, I actually want to help your view of confession with God to grow a little greater.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Confession means to say what is true.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And sometimes what is true is that you're struggling with addiction.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Sometimes what is true is that you're struggling with sin.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Sometimes what is true is you're struggling with immorality in a relationship.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   But sometimes what is true is you are paralyzed in fear.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And so, I want to begin this little part of confession, I want to begin by praying against fear.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   And by naming your fears.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Each of you is probably afraid of something.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   It may not be obvious to you every day, but it's probably the thing beneath the thing.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   It's something that you're afraid of.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And so, I want to take just a minute, and I want you to process that with the people you've been praying with.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And 2 Timothy 1:7 says this, "For God gave us a spirit, not of fear, but of power, of love, and self-control."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   So, if we're going to fight sin, then we have to not be afraid.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And so, what is it that you're afraid of?
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Of course, the thing that the enemy has made you believe is more powerful than God.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   So, with your people right now, I want you to just confess your fear.

[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   I know, y'all are just getting started.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   But I'm not going to miss sin, too, so we're going there.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And here's how I want to do this.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   So, you've said your fear. Many of you haven't had a chance to pray for it yet.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And here's how we're going to do confession.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   We're going to say it out loud.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "God, forgive me for blank."
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   "God, release me from blank."
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Whatever that fear is, say what is true.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   And we're just going to spend some time in the quiet.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And you can stand up and say it loud, or you can stand up and say it quiet.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I don't care, but I want you to stand up, because there is something powerful about standing up and speaking it.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   [silence]
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Alright. Calm down, folks.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Let's go.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   [silence]
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   [inaudible]

[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   [inaudible]
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   [inaudible]
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   [inaudible]
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   [inaudible]
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   You promise, God,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   if we confess our sins to you,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   that you will forgive us our sins.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And so we believe that.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   And we pray against the enemy who condemns.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   We pray against the enemy who lies.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   We pray against the enemy who issues a spirit of fear.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   God, we want you.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   We want a night like tonight to be our everyday life.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Praying with our friends and running after you and fighting the darkness.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   God, we don't want to exist for our few days here.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   We want to be in the river of your spirit.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   We want to not miss every good work that you have prepared in advance for us to do.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   So, God, would we not bow down to the lies?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Would we not bow down to the condemnation?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   But would you be the lifter of our heads?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Would you lift our heads and remind us what is true?
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   You have us.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   You love us.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   You like us.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   And we can come to you with anything and everything.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Every word that was spoken,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   God, in confession, quiet or loud.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   God, I pray that you would bring comfort and peace.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   I pray that there would be no shame,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   that there would be no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And for those who have not yet met Christ Jesus,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   would this be the moment?
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Would this be the moment where they realize
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   a broken people can come to God in their brokenness?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   God, I pray for the person right now
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   that knows that they don't know you.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   God, I pray that this would be the minute
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   that they would just simply pray these words,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   because this is all we do,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   is to put our faith and hope in you.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Jesus, I need you.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I believe that you are the son of God.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   I believe that these sins that I've been so afraid
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   to say out loud, God, that you knew them already.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   And that you have the power to forgive them
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   because of the blood of Jesus.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   So would you come into my life and I will serve you.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I will follow you.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   Help me do that.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   And our God who conquered death
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   has the power for sure to conquer sin.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Yes, it is good.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   It is good.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   And so we're gonna pray for the world
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and for the people that don't know him yet.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   - Yeah.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   So the last thing we wanna pray is,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   I wanna invite you to just think about the people
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   in your spheres of influence
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   who do not have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   They might be here with you tonight.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I was thinking about a woman in scripture, Lydia,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   and here's what it says about her.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   It says, "The Lord opened her heart
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   "to pay attention to what was said by Paul."
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   And so I just want you to think,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   is there someone in your life,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   maybe it's a family member, maybe it's a friend,
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   maybe it's a co-worker,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   maybe it's someone that you work out with
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   or someone that you live next to in your apartment complex,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   and something in your heart is burdened
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   for them to know Jesus Christ.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   And it is your deep desire for God to do in their life
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   what he did with Lydia,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   that he would open their heart
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   to pay attention to the good news that Jenny just shared,
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   that Jesus Christ died.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Why did he die?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Because we needed a savior,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   that every single one of us is sinful,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   that we've all turned and gone our own way,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   that no one has lived the life that God has required,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and because of that, we all deserve punishment,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   separation from God.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And yet Jesus Christ died in our place.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   He was punished so that we wouldn't have to be.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   He rose from the dead as a display
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   that his payment for our sin was enough.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So if there's someone in your life that you want that for,
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   would you just take a moment and would you pray that?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   You can pray out loud, you can call their name out.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   If they're with you right now, maybe you don't call it out.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   But let's take a moment,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   and I want to invite you to pray specifically
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   that God would open up specific people's hearts to the gospel.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Take a moment, pray out loud for them.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   (gentle music)
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   (people whispering)
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   (gentle music)
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   (people whispering)
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   (gentle music)
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   (people whispering)
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   (gentle music)
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   (people whispering)
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   (gentle music)
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   (gentle music)
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   (gentle music)
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   (gentle music)
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   (gentle music)
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   (gentle music)
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   (gentle music)
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   (people whispering)
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And as you continue to pray,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   I want you to pray for those around the world
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   who have never heard the name of Jesus.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   I think about what Revelation chapter seven says.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   It paints the picture of a day.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   It says this, "After this I looked and behold
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   "a great multitude that no one could number
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   "from every nation, from all tribes and peoples
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   "and languages, standing before the throne
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   "and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   "with palm branches in their hands,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   "and crying out with a loud voice,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   "'Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   "'and to the Lamb.'"
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   And so I want to ask you guys to pray for that.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   Beg God to raise up people to go to those in the world
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   who have never heard the name of Jesus.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   Maybe that's you.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Maybe that is you sitting here in this room
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   and something in your heart right now is on fire saying,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   "I'll take the gospel to those who have never heard of Jesus."
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   But let's pray right now.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Pray that God would raise people up and send them out.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Pray that God would reveal himself
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   in miraculous ways tonight in various people groups,
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   that there would be revival all around the world.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Pray for that right now.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   [music]
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   [whispering]
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   [music]
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   [music]
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   [music]
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   [music]
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And as you continue to pray, I'm going to read you a prayer
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   that the apostles prayed in the book of Acts
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   when they were enduring persecution for sharing the gospel.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   Here's what was prayed.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   "And now, Lord, look upon their threats
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   with all boldness while you stretch out your hand to heal,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   and signs and wonders are performed
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   It says, "And when they had prayed, the place
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   in which they were gathered together was shaken,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   and continued to speak the word of God with boldness."
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   And so, God, my prayer is right now in this place, God.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   You would fill each person who knows you,
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   who calls you Savior and Lord.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   I pray that you would fill them with your spirit.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   And I pray that this would be a generation of young adults
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   that are filled with boldness, God, that tomorrow,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   when they wake up and they go to their work,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   may they see their workplaces as mission fields,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   as places with people who desperately need to hear the gospel.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I pray that tomorrow there would be hundreds,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   if not thousands of conversations that are happening
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   across the city of Dallas where the name of Jesus
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   is being proclaimed, the gospel is being shared.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   And I pray that tomorrow or even tonight
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   would be the day of salvation for someone,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   that the gospel would be shared and someone would put their trust in you.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   I thank you, God, for what you're doing in this place.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   I thank you for every individual here.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   I pray that when they leave in just a few minutes,
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   God, they would know that you are leaving with them,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   and they can continue the conversation with you
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   as they get in the car.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Lord, I pray that as we seek you in prayer, we would find you.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   And I pray that this summer we would have our best summer yet with you,
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   because as we draw near to you, you would draw near to us.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   May we be a people who know the joy of your presence
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   and the pleasures forevermore that exist in you, Lord Jesus.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   We need you, we love you, and we sing to you in Jesus' name.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   Amen.
