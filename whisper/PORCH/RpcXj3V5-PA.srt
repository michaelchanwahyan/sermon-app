 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:17,760
 Well, welcome to The Porch.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,440
 Wherever you are tuning in tonight from around the country

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,000
 or even the world, welcome.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,120
 And if you find yourself in Houston tuning in,

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,720
 then I want to encourage you to check out The Porch Live

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,240
 Houston.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,720
 Friends down there are starting tonight for the first time

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,480
 live since the quarantine.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,440
 And if you're in this room, welcome, friends.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,600
 Appreciate y'all being here.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,200
 My name is Josiah, and I have the privilege of serving here

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,520
 on staff at The Porch.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,200
 Well, I thought I'd start out with just sharing a quick story.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,040
 I want to take you back to sixth grade.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,720
 Yes, we're going back to sixth grade.

17
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,720
 So go back there with me for just a minute.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,000
 If you're anything like me, it was baggy Tommy Hilfiger

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,880
 shirts, it was baggy jeans, and it was the ball chain necklace.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,560
 Like, I get it.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,920
 I know I just dated myself.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,760
 I did it.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,240
 All good, though.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,280
 But here's what I know.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,780
 Here's what I know about sixth grade.

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,960
 I remember walking into science class for the first time,

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,260
 and the science teacher gave me one of these.

28
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,920
 He gave me a Styrofoam cup, and he gave me some soil,

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
 and he gave me a bean.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,760
 Y'all remember this?

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,240
 I know, Ramsey, you remember this, don't you?

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,120
 Yeah, so we get this Styrofoam cup, we get some soil,

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,440
 and then we get a bean.

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,880
 And before too long, we see a little green shoot sprout up.

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,880
 And I remember the science teacher specifically saying,

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,080
 you're going to need three things in order for this bean

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,960
 to grow.

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,560
 You're going to need sun, you're going to need water,

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,720
 and you're going to need soil.

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,280
 And some of you are like, man, you've

41
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
 been growing that in your garage?

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,960
 No, no, no, that's not what this is about, I promise you.

43
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,320
 Maybe BC, before Christ's days, but listen, stay with me.

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,120
 Listen, this is why I start there tonight.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,880
 Because just like science class, they told us,

46
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,800
 hey, you're going to need these things to grow, sun, water,

47
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,680
 and soil to grow this bean.

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,040
 There are things in our faith that we need to grow.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,600
 There are things that God is asking us to have,

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,380
 and really saying, hey, if you don't have these things,

51
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,760
 then you will not grow.

52
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,000
 And so stay with me for a second.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,560
 Imagine your prayer life.

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,240
 Imagine your prayer life is the sun, okay?

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,160
 So the sun equals your prayer life.

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,760
 Let's say the Bible, the Bible equals,

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,840
 man, that equals the water, okay?

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
 Let's say the Bible equals the water.

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,440
 That's your intake of God's word.

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,480
 And then let's say the soil represents your community.

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,800
 And when I say community,

62
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,960
 I'm talking about your friend groups.

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,760
 I'm talking about those people that you hang out with.

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,540
 And this is what I know.

65
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,920
 You can have an amazing prayer life.

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,200
 You can get into God's word every single day.

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,100
 You can memorize scripture.

68
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,860
 But if your soil, which is your community,

69
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,560
 your friend group, if your soil is toxic,

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
 then you will not grow.

71
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,280
 Like bottom line, it will not happen.

72
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,200
 We've never, we will never be the best version of ourself.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
 So if we wanna grow,

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,600
 then we will have to have the right community.

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,120
 And if you don't wanna grow, said no one ever,

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,420
 like you, then you won't pursue these things.

77
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,320
 Tonight, I wanna talk to you about community.

78
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,480
 Where are you planted?

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,940
 Psalm 92, 13 says,

80
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,760
 "Planted in the house of God, you will flourish."

81
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,500
 You will flourish.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,320
 And for some of us, man,

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,140
 it's been a long hard season of this coronavirus

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,140
 because like we've been quarantined.

85
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,420
 But my fear tonight is that some of you

86
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,160
 are gonna hear a message like this,

87
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,380
 and you're gonna sorta connect with God,

88
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,260
 and you're gonna sorta connect with God's people,

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,420
 but you're gonna walk away

90
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,620
 and you're just not gonna go all in.

91
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,760
 And here's what's at stake.

92
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,800
 The Bible says that when you don't go all in with community,

93
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,800
 then in other words, like you're hushing the voice of God,

94
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,400
 because one of God's primary means of communicating

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 and provisions in our life as Christians is community.

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,120
 It's getting with other trusted friends who follow Jesus.

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,360
 We call that community here at the porch in Watermark.

98
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,080
 It's a core value that we embody here.

99
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,580
 It's this idea that we were made for relationships.

100
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,260
 If you're taking notes, and I hope you are,

101
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,720
 point number one, we were made for relationships.

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,160
 Like we were created for relationships.

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
 Like you see this rhythm in Genesis 1

104
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,200
 where God is creating and he says it's good,

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,840
 and he creates and he says it's good,

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,640
 and he creates and he says it's good.

107
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
 And he does this six times.

108
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,600
 And then on the seventh time, he rests.

109
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,720
 And so you have this paradise, a place of perfection.

110
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,140
 Sin hasn't even entered the world yet.

111
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,080
 It's just Adam and God, and God is giving Adam authority

112
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,360
 among all the animals and in the entire creation.

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,080
 And so there should be this amazing connection

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,620
 and a perfect situation with Adam and God,

115
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,400
 but then something happens.

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,600
 There's an interruption that breaks into the creation story.

117
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,040
 God says there is something there that is not good.

118
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,920
 Like what could be wrong with perfection after God created?

119
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,740
 That's a question.

120
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,960
 Can there be something not good in a perfect place?

121
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,640
 Let's check out Genesis 2.18.

122
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,120
 This is what it says.

123
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,600
 The Lord God said it is not good for the man to be alone.

124
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,120
 Being alone was the very first thing that God said

125
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,880
 that hey, it wasn't good.

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,480
 And I know this is kind of fascinating to me

127
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,040
 because nothing is fallen yet.

128
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,640
 Everything is still in perfection.

129
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,000
 And so God is saying in this moment that,

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,680
 hey, it's not good for you to be alone, Adam.

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
 And he's telling us tonight, years later,

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
 that it's not good for us to be alone.

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
 Humans are created to live in relationship with each other.

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
 Think of it like solitary confinement.

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,600
 Solitary confinement is what they do in prison.

136
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,480
 I mean, I looked it up and it's people in prison.

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,920
 They dread this punishment of solitary confinement.

138
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
 Like one person said,

139
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,760
 keeping prisoners totally isolated from a living world

140
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,000
 comes dangerously close to the penal tomb.

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
 Being locked up is a place

142
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
 where you have zero human interaction.

143
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,700
 And we know that one of the worst things that can happen

144
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,440
 is you cut humans off from the rest of the world.

145
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,400
 Psychologically, it literally destroys them.

146
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,240
 This is what this person is saying.

147
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,960
 In other words, it's a slow death for prisoners.

148
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,540
 And listen, you might not be in a prison

149
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,000
 of solitary confinement,

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,200
 but you could be in a prison to anxiety.

151
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,640
 Like you could be in a prison tonight to depression.

152
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,760
 You could be in a prison tonight of loneliness

153
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,680
 because you're disconnected from God's people.

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
 And so there's an amazing truth

155
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
 for us to latch onto tonight.

156
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,440
 And this truth is even if it was just us and God alone

157
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,480
 in perfection, he would say that's not good.

158
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,140
 Because you know, I hear people tell me all the time,

159
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,500
 man, I'm good Josiah.

160
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,660
 I don't need the church.

161
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,200
 I don't need other brothers or sisters in my life

162
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
 to run with.

163
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,860
 I'm good, man.

164
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,980
 It's just me and God.

165
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,320
 Like he knows me, I know him and we're tight.

166
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,080
 And I'm sorry to break it to you,

167
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,700
 but the Bible contradicts that type of thinking.

168
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,960
 I mean, I thought that way for so long in my own life,

169
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,140
 but in Proverbs 18, one, it says this,

170
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,940
 "Whoever isolates himself."

171
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,740
 In other words, cuts himself off, seeks his own desire.

172
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,500
 He breaks out against all sound judgment.

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,040
 I mean, he will not have the wisdom

174
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,740
 that God wants him to have.

175
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,580
 In case you missed it earlier, Psalm 92, 13,

176
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,740
 "Those who are planted in the house of the Lord

177
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,860
 self-growth, self-flourish."

178
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,020
 Planted in the house of God, you will flourish.

179
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,220
 Doing life together, getting connected with people

180
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,220
 that don't look like you, maybe even act like you,

181
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,060
 smell like you, dress like you,

182
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,740
 have the same desires as you.

183
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,100
 God is saying that's a good thing.

184
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,940
 Listen, my wife and I, Kathy, like we could be,

185
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,000
 I mean, we couldn't be any different.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
 I mean, she's creative, she's a designer.

187
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,860
 She's just kind of has this, you know,

188
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,940
 I call them piles of goodness all over the house.

189
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,020
 She's messy, but she's creative.

190
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,060
 I'm type A to the max, right?

191
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,740
 I mean, seriously, that's it.

192
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,400
 We're totally different,

193
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,700
 but God has used that to compliment us

194
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,700
 and to grow us and to make really us

195
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,800
 into the people that he wants us to be.

196
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,620
 Like it's easy for us to believe this lie

197
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,860
 that my faith is just between me and God

198
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
 and I don't really need anyone else.

199
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,900
 God and I are cool.

200
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,540
 I don't need to worry about the rest of you guys.

201
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,740
 I'm just gonna do my thing.

202
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,100
 And although that sounds really good,

203
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,420
 it's just not truthful.

204
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,580
 It's just not healthy, as God would say.

205
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,160
 You know why Corona has been so hard for some of us?

206
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,560
 It's because it's put us in a quarantine state

207
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,080
 where we really haven't been able to interact with people.

208
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,320
 And so God is saying,

209
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,960
 "Hey, you were never meant to be isolated.

210
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,160
 You were made for relationships."

211
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
 And eventually, no matter where you live,

212
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,240
 they're gonna open everything up.

213
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,080
 And they're gonna say,

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,360
 "Hey, you don't need to quarantine yourself anymore."

215
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,720
 And tonight the God of the universe is saying,

216
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,480
 "Hey, you don't need to quarantine.

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
 You can come out of hiding.

218
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,480
 You can interact with people.

219
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,760
 Still be safe.

220
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
 Jump on Zoom.

221
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,740
 We'll talk about that here in a minute,

222
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,600
 but you can do things that causes you to lean

223
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,340
 into other trusted men and women who love Jesus

224
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,480
 and are following Him."

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,960
 And so some of you are like,

226
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,320
 "Man, I got relationships, Josiah.

227
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
 I got it.

228
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
 I mean, seriously, you don't need to tell me that.

229
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,160
 I know that I was created, I was made for relationships,

230
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,600
 but this is what I wanna ask you.

231
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,240
 Are they the right people?

232
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,680
 Are they the people following Jesus?"

233
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
 So when I say stop quarantining from people,

234
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,080
 this should also, for some of us, it should say,

235
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,560
 "Hey, some of us need to start quarantining

236
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,800
 from the wrong people."

237
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,640
 Why?

238
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,460
 Because this is what I know,

239
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,960
 because you catch the symptoms of those you run with.

240
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
 Like the people that you run with,

241
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,000
 the people that I run with,

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,120
 like I'm gonna catch the symptoms.

243
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,240
 I'm gonna catch their sicknesses.

244
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,640
 Like we know this to be true, like corona season.

245
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,080
 I don't know how many times I've done this.

246
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,460
 Like, "You've been traveling?

247
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,680
 Oh man, you probably got corona.

248
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,520
 I'm out.

249
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,400
 Hey, we need to separate ourselves from each other."

250
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,120
 And so we do this,

251
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,760
 even in the season that we find ourself in.

252
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,840
 And some of us, quite frankly,

253
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,520
 we need to do this with some of the people in our life

254
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,800
 that are dragging us down,

255
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,640
 because you're gonna catch the symptoms

256
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,440
 and the sicknesses of the people that you run with.

257
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,840
 This is true physically.

258
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,240
 And what God's saying tonight, this is true spiritually.

259
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
 The Bible says it like this.

260
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,940
 2 Corinthians 6, 14.

261
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,620
 "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.

262
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,040
 For what does righteousness and wickedness have in common?

263
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,760
 They contradict each other.

264
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,700
 They're on totally opposite ends of the spectrum.

265
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
 And so don't be yoked.

266
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,420
 Don't put yourself in a position where, man,

267
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,280
 your best friends are people that aren't like-minded.

268
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,640
 It's not saying, "Hey, you can't have friends

269
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,840
 that don't think like you and believe like you."

270
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
 But they're saying,

271
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
 "Hey, when it comes to your closest boys

272
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,680
 or your closest ladies, women,

273
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,200
 like those should be people

274
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,600
 that are running hard after Jesus."

275
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,640
 I mean, it shouldn't be this idea where,

276
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,800
 "Hey, we're just gonna separate ourself

277
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,640
 and we're just gonna have our little holy huddles

278
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,480
 and Christian cliques.

279
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
 We're never gonna try to affect the rest of the world."

280
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
 No, that would be crazy.

281
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,320
 No, we've been called to be the light of the world.

282
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,280
 But when those people start affecting us

283
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,000
 and bringing us down, that's when it's like,

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,700
 "Hey, man, we gotta draw the line

285
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,960
 and we gotta have people around us that we can trust

286
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,640
 that are gonna point us back to Him."

287
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,460
 Goes on and says,

288
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,720
 "Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?"

289
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,640
 Point number two, if you're taking notes,

290
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,720
 we were made to be fully known.

291
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,080
 We were made to be fully known.

292
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,680
 Most people who fight anxiety, shame, and guilt

293
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,600
 do so on their own when we were never supposed to do so.

294
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,280
 Like God meant for us never to hide.

295
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,240
 You were made to be fully known.

296
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,460
 God is saying tonight, "Hey, I've made you to be known."

297
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,260
 Our generation who is literally

298
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,080
 one of the most connected generations ever in human history

299
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,980
 because of the smartphone and social media,

300
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,900
 social scientists are saying that,

301
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,100
 "Man, even though we're connected, we're the most lonely.

302
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,380
 We're the loneliest

303
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,740
 and the most depressed generation statistically."

304
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,920
 And this is even truer right now during the Corona season.

305
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,860
 Like these, I mean, these stats are just skyrocketing.

306
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,980
 And this is why we also tend to make really poor decisions

307
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,560
 when we make these decisions in isolation.

308
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,580
 If nobody truly knows you,

309
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,780
 knows how you're feeling, what you're facing,

310
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,260
 what's going on in your life,

311
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,340
 then God's saying, "Hey, that's truly not good."

312
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,180
 God's also saying,

313
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,620
 "Hey, it's not good to be alone in the crowd."

314
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,180
 Like some of you tonight, you're like, "Man, I'm not alone.

315
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,820
 Man, I do the CrossFit thing.

316
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,140
 I do SoulCycle.

317
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,800
 I do bar classes.

318
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,540
 Man, after work, I go to the restaurant.

319
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,260
 I have a few drinks at the bar with some of my friends."

320
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,620
 But come on, if we were honest with ourselves,

321
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,100
 like they don't know much else than, you know,

322
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,140
 you're a Cowboys fan,

323
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,940
 what you bought on Amazon the night before

324
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,580
 and what you think about the Bachelor.

325
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,660
 Like God is saying,

326
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,740
 "Hey, it's not good to be alone in the crowd."

327
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,620
 Some of you are like, "I get a hundred likes on Instagram

328
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,260
 or retweets on Twitter," or whatever the case may be.

329
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,160
 That's not being known.

330
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,940
 And here's why it's not good.

331
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
 This is so important.

332
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:03,240
 I believe that you'll never be fully loved

333
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,260
 until you're fully known.

334
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,940
 Like you will never be fully loved until you're fully known

335
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,320
 because they're just loving some false version of yourself

336
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,200
 and of myself.

337
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,980
 And so I kind of liken it to this quarantine mask.

338
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,260
 Everywhere you go lately,

339
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,980
 it seems like someone is wearing one of these

340
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,240
 and when you're not wearing one,

341
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,520
 you just kind of feel out of place.

342
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,560
 That's me 'cause I can't stand these things.

343
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,240
 But I was in Costco the other day

344
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,520
 and it was my duty to get groceries this week.

345
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,760
 And so I went into Costco and my wife couldn't even go in

346
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,560
 because we only had one of these in the car.

347
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,560
 And so I made my way in Costco and I can't,

348
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,360
 I'm having a hard time breathing in this thing.

349
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,580
 It's just, they're just awkward.

350
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,360
 They're uncomfortable, right?

351
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,100
 And it's bizarre because, man,

352
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,580
 now you really have to wear one.

353
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,580
 And so listen, this isn't really a new concept.

354
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,000
 Like if you were to be honest with yourself

355
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,840
 and if I were to be honest with myself tonight,

356
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 like physically, like this is a new concept.

357
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,200
 But we've been wearing masks for a long time.

358
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
 Like some of us, like we wear masks,

359
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,840
 because this mask represents hiding.

360
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,640
 Like we wear a mask when we sin

361
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,140
 and we try to hide ourself from letting people see that.

362
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,860
 Or, I mean, we just wanna put our best foot forward

363
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,580
 or hey, we try to act like we have it all together.

364
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,340
 So we wear this mask, we hide from people out of fear

365
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,260
 of, hey, what are they gonna think of us if I share this

366
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,120
 or if they know this part about me?

367
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,300
 And so you see, I got pretty good.

368
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,980
 I mean, from my life, I got pretty good at wearing a mask.

369
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,700
 You know, it was invisible of course,

370
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,780
 but it was a mask nonetheless.

371
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,660
 I was, remember the first time I looked at porn,

372
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,700
 this idea, man, I love this.

373
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,760
 It was amazing.

374
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,060
 It sparked all this emotion

375
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,740
 I never felt before in these feelings.

376
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,260
 But I knew deep down something was wrong,

377
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,540
 something was broken.

378
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,660
 And so I just put on this mask of like,

379
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,500
 man, I'm just gonna keep that thing suppressed.

380
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,620
 I'm not really gonna let anyone know

381
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,060
 that I'm becoming an addict.

382
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,380
 Or the cross necklace.

383
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,540
 I remember wearing a cross necklace

384
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,300
 when I played baseball games and it was good luck charm.

385
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,620
 I wanted people to think that I was spiritual

386
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,380
 or going out to the parties and getting drunk,

387
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,500
 doing that lifestyle.

388
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,580
 I wanted, I mean, I had my cross necklace outs

389
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,060
 for everyone to see 'cause I wanted them to see

390
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,140
 that I was a pretty good person.

391
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,220
 And so that was just a form of a mask

392
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,700
 or being single 'til I was 31 years old.

393
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,220
 I wanted to wear the mask, say, hey man, I don't need that.

394
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,620
 I don't need a woman.

395
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,180
 But deep down inside, I'm like, man, I wanna be married.

396
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,900
 So I just kind of put the mask on of, man, I'm good.

397
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,820
 See, we wear masks to mask the pain

398
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,140
 and the hardship that we're facing.

399
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,180
 But you know who I'm not wearing a mask around?

400
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,820
 My community.

401
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,540
 These are men that I've grown to love

402
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,940
 because I know them and they know me.

403
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,460
 No matter where I've been in thought, word, and action,

404
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,900
 like I can come to them and I can share where I've been

405
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,140
 in those areas of my life.

406
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
 And here's what I know,

407
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,040
 they're gonna love me unconditionally.

408
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,180
 They're not just gonna affirm

409
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,900
 or condone the things that I'm doing,

410
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,540
 but they're gonna point me to Christ

411
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
 and they're gonna point me to his truth

412
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,180
 and they're gonna hold me accountable.

413
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,860
 Just last night, I had a disagreement with my wife, Kathy,

414
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,540
 and it was getting late and I knew I needed to study.

415
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,740
 And we just kind of shelved it and said,

416
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,860
 hey, let's talk about it in the morning.

417
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,340
 And I went downstairs and started studying

418
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,560
 and the attack came.

419
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,420
 The attack to get on Instagram

420
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,980
 and start looking at things,

421
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,300
 the temptation came for me to look at things

422
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,820
 that I knew I shouldn't have looked at.

423
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,260
 And in that moment, I was, man, I was getting,

424
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,300
 I mean, I was getting worked up over the fact that,

425
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,580
 hey, this is a part of my past,

426
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,780
 this is a part of my story, I want it,

427
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,660
 there's still a part of my heart that loves porn,

428
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,500
 I'm just trying to be honest tonight.

429
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,780
 But in that moment, I reached out.

430
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,260
 I reached out because I knew Satan wanted nothing more

431
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,260
 than to get me to fall before I taught this message.

432
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,500
 And by God's grace, I didn't look at anything,

433
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,260
 but I was tempted, so I reached out to four men in my life

434
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,980
 that God has placed in my life since I moved here

435
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,220
 about 10 months ago.

436
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,580
 And I just said, hey, look, I'm in the middle of studying

437
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,860
 and I'm tempted, my wife and I just had a disagreement

438
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,700
 and listen, I am tempted to look at things

439
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,660
 I know I shouldn't.

440
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,820
 And they were probably sleeping,

441
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,780
 but you know what that did in that moment?

442
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,700
 It lessened, it weakened that temptation

443
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,300
 because I knew the very next day,

444
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,180
 they were gonna ask me and they did,

445
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,940
 hey, did you win the battle?

446
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,700
 Did you look at porn?

447
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,340
 Did you reconcile with your wife?

448
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:18,180
 And they did, they asked me and by God's grace, I did, I won.

449
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,700
 But don't be fooled, I wanna wear a mask all the time.

450
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,620
 Like I wanna cover up the brokenness in my life.

451
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,260
 Like, do you think I wanted to reach out to them

452
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,220
 and let them know that I was struggling last night?

453
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,540
 Absolutely not.

454
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,660
 Like I want them to see my best foot forward.

455
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,700
 Like I want them to see that Josiah is strong.

456
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,020
 I want them to see that, hey, there's no struggles,

457
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,780
 but when I'm feeling tempted to look at something

458
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,940
 I know I shouldn't look at,

459
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,060
 like I need to confess that on a thought level,

460
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,020
 not wait till I get to the action.

461
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,500
 And I remember thinking last night,

462
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,560
 God, thank you for providing a way out.

463
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,340
 Thank you for weakening this part of me.

464
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,380
 Thank you that, hey, even though I wanna be seen

465
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,580
 and I wanna be in the best light,

466
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,060
 thank you that like I can by faith remove the mask

467
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,460
 and trust that when they see the real me,

468
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,620
 I won't get infected with rejection.

469
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,220
 I won't get infected with shame and guilt and condemnation.

470
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,040
 Why?

471
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,940
 Because you nailed Jesus to the cross for those things.

472
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,220
 And Romans 8, one says,

473
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,980
 "There is therefore now no condemnation

474
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,340
 "for those that are in Christ Jesus."

475
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,100
 And so listen, even if they wanted to shame me,

476
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,580
 I know that there's no shame in that

477
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,900
 because you went to the cross

478
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,220
 and all of my sin was poured out on him at the cross.

479
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,160
 And so this is why I can be real.

480
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,860
 This is why I can be,

481
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,500
 I can stand boldly before you and even share this.

482
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,100
 Like there's a part of my heart, it's like,

483
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,300
 man, what are people gonna think of me?

484
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,700
 I don't care.

485
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,460
 It's because Christ paid for that.

486
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,060
 And he set me free from that rejection

487
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,060
 and that condemnation and that shame.

488
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,120
 And he wants to do that in your life too.

489
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,060
 It's time to take off the mask tonight.

490
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,720
 What mask are you wearing?

491
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,220
 What mask are you wearing

492
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,280
 that you're tempted even to put on?

493
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,780
 Tonight it's time to take off the mask.

494
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,420
 Psalm 32, three.

495
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,300
 The Psalmist says, "When I kept silent,

496
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,680
 "my bones wasted away.

497
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,520
 "Through my groanings all day long."

498
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,540
 The Psalmist is saying, "Hey, when you suppress sin,

499
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,360
 "your bones are gonna waste away.

500
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,780
 "Like you're gonna get sick.

501
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,620
 "Like when you don't bring that to the light,

502
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,020
 "when you don't share that,

503
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,020
 "share that thing that you thought you'd never tell anyone."

504
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,100
 Like some of you right now, you're listening to this like,

505
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,500
 "Oh no, I couldn't do that.

506
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,180
 "Like I promised myself

507
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,840
 "that I'm taking that thing to the grave

508
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,700
 "and I'm not doing, I'm not going there, Josiah.

509
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,220
 "Absolutely not."

510
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,520
 And God is saying, "Hey, if you go there,

511
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,860
 "there's healing, there's forgiveness.

512
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,120
 "I want to make you whole."

513
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,180
 I believe this with all my heart

514
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,380
 that the power of sin is in secrecy.

515
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,360
 In other words, like when we decide to suppress sin

516
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,160
 and we decide, "Hey, we're not gonna tell anybody

517
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,380
 "those things that we thought we were gonna take

518
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,220
 "to the grave."

519
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,000
 But when we bring those things to light,

520
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,480
 it loosens its power and it weakens.

521
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,200
 This is why in James 5:16, he says,

522
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,820
 "Therefore confess your sins to each other

523
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,800
 "and pray for each other so that you may be healed."

524
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,640
 And then it goes on and says,

525
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,060
 "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."

526
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,800
 It's not saying just confess that to anybody.

527
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,760
 It's saying to confess that to a righteous person,

528
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,600
 someone that loves Jesus,

529
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,420
 someone that's in right standing with God,

530
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,060
 someone that's pursuing Him.

531
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,880
 See, I believe with all my heart that the secret to life

532
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,480
 is to live a life without secrets.

533
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,820
 Where we begin to see that our whole life is exposed

534
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,440
 before God and someone that we can trust.

535
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
 Am I saying, "Hey, go share this with 10 people?"

536
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,280
 No.

537
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,760
 Real practical, let's just bring it down a level.

538
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,880
 Do you know someone that you could trust

539
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,900
 that follows Jesus?

540
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,200
 That I encourage you tonight to pick up the phone

541
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,160
 before you go to bed and just say,

542
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,320
 "Hey, how are you doing?"

543
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,640
 And then tell them about how you're doing

544
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,140
 and say, "Hey, listen, I don't know why I called you,

545
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,900
 "but I know God is telling me to call you.

546
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,740
 "And I just got to share with you, I'm struggling.

547
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,180
 "Can you pray for me?"

548
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,120
 And maybe you can't be giving explicit details,

549
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,920
 but maybe you just said, "Hey, I'm struggling.

550
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,500
 "I looked at something that I shouldn't have."

551
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,720
 Or, "Hey, I've been overeating or I've been under eating

552
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,600
 "because life seems out of control.

553
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,240
 "And this is one area of my life that I can control."

554
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,200
 Maybe you would pick up the phone

555
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,980
 and you would just say something like,

556
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,880
 "Hey, I've been trading naked pictures with people

557
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,960
 "because I've been just craving for affirmation."

558
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,220
 There, I said it.

559
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,960
 Will you help me?

560
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,720
 Listen, if you're waiting for someone to come to you

561
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,680
 and ask you how you're doing

562
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,620
 or ask you what you've been struggling with,

563
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,400
 listen, you're probably gonna be waiting

564
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,700
 longer than you want.

565
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,720
 Like confession isn't gonna find you.

566
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,680
 You have to find it.

567
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,980
 You have to run to confession.

568
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,960
 You have to find someone that you can trust

569
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,920
 that will not mismanage information.

570
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,680
 And some of you, that's your story.

571
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,660
 But I would say, don't stop.

572
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,620
 Hang on to Romans 8.1.

573
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,640
 I don't care if they miss,

574
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,320
 I mean, I do care that they mismanage information,

575
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,880
 but listen, at the end of the day,

576
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,160
 you don't have to let that mismanaging of information

577
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,800
 define you because God says you're forgiven

578
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,980
 and you do not have shame anymore

579
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,860
 because I put that on my son, Jesus.

580
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,180
 Listen, the best version of you and I

581
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,740
 stands on the other side of community.

582
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,580
 Do you know that?

583
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,300
 Do you believe that tonight?

584
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,960
 The most healed and whole person

585
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,000
 that you wanna be and that I wanna be,

586
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,060
 I believe stands on the other side of community

587
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,900
 where you can go to them and you can confess.

588
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,240
 And I'm wondering tonight, do you have that?

589
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,080
 Do you have that?

590
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,400
 Have you prayed and maybe asked God to forgive you

591
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,300
 and he's forgiving you,

592
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,060
 but you're still walking around wounded

593
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,560
 and kind of beat up?

594
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,260
 And I believe it's because some of us,

595
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,780
 and we walk out 1 John 1, 9,

596
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,540
 where we confess our sin and he's faithful

597
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,940
 and just to forgive us of our sin

598
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,740
 and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,

599
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,060
 the scripture says.

600
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,300
 And so we're forgiven, but we're not healed

601
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,660
 because healing comes when we confess that one to another.

602
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,380
 Where you have trusted friends who come alongside of you

603
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,000
 and help you fight against your sin.

604
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,420
 They begin to help you come up with a game plan

605
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,100
 to defeat that sin that continues to beat you down.

606
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,400
 Let me ask you, what's your plan for defeating sin?

607
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,280
 What is your plan for defeating sin in your life?

608
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,200
 Like some of us, man, we're losing the battle

609
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
 before we ever go to war

610
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,760
 because we walk into the battle without a plan.

611
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,120
 And the God of the universe is saying,

612
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,800
 "Hey, listen, it's okay to be vulnerable.

613
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,700
 It's okay to be transparent."

614
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,560
 2 Corinthians 12, eight, God responds to Paul and says,

615
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,800
 "Paul, my power is made perfect in your weakness."

616
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,580
 And look what Paul's response is.

617
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,600
 "Therefore, I'm gonna boast about my weakness

618
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,720
 because when I'm weak, who is strong?

619
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,360
 He's strong."

620
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,680
 That's when you begin to experience the power of God

621
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,520
 in your life and my life.

622
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,480
 This quarantine, it's been a completely different experience

623
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,940
 for those who have been in community

624
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,920
 versus those who have not.

625
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,640
 But tonight, that can change.

626
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,760
 Tonight, like right after this message,

627
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,760
 you can go to watermark.org/community

628
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,000
 and you can sign up.

629
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,360
 If you live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area,

630
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,720
 you can sign up to get in community.

631
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,600
 Maybe you're just like, "Hey, I don't have that.

632
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,760
 I don't know what this guy's...

633
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,720
 I mean, I'm starting to understand

634
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
 what this guy's talking about,

635
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,000
 and I'm starting to believe that I need it."

636
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,660
 Do it.

637
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
 Some of you tonight, you're like,

638
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,360
 "Man, I don't live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area."

639
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,320
 Then hey, find a church that loves Jesus

640
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,800
 and preaches Jesus and wants to be about Jesus.

641
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,160
 And if you need help, reach out.

642
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,260
 We'd love to help you.

643
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,600
 I can't challenge you enough to take this step,

644
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,680
 not just because we see this rooted in God's word,

645
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,720
 but because I've experienced this with my own life

646
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,360
 and continue to experience this to this day.

647
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,360
 Jesus got ahold of me in college and I was narcissistic.

648
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,240
 I was selfish.

649
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
 It was all about Josiah.

650
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,160
 But then the breaking moment happened

651
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,000
 where I finally saw my sin for what it is

652
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,960
 in light of a holy God.

653
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,160
 And I saw in that moment that all of my sin

654
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,240
 was poured out on Him, and I got what He deserved,

655
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,260
 and He got what I deserved.

656
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,260
 And I remember experiencing this incredible conversion

657
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,200
 where I'm like, "Hey, man, I'm empty.

658
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,840
 I'm unsatisfied and unfulfilled."

659
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,960
 And it's because the proverb says,

660
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
 "There's a way that seems right to man,

661
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,680
 but that way ends in death."

662
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,000
 And tonight, God is saying, "Hey, if you want life,

663
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
 then you'll pursue this thing called community."

664
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,760
 And what I quickly learned is that God never calls you

665
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,720
 from something until He calls,

666
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,160
 He will never call you from something

667
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,360
 without calling you to something.

668
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,440
 And one of the very first things He called me to

669
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,480
 was to change my playground and my playmates.

670
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,120
 In other words, those places that I would hang out,

671
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,680
 those people that I would hang out with,

672
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,880
 He said, "Hey, if you're gonna be my man, Josiah,

673
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,920
 then you gotta start changing where you hang out,

674
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,200
 where you go on the weekends, and who you hang out with."

675
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
 And sometimes people come up to me and like,

676
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,960
 "Dude, pornography, sex addiction, lying,

677
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,560
 partying, stealing, like those things,

678
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,480
 like how did you do it?"

679
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,880
 And I look at them and say, "Hey, I got with some men

680
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,740
 that wanted to be about it.

681
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,800
 I got with some men that really loved Jesus.

682
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,120
 They didn't just talk about it,

683
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,780
 but they really wanted to live out who He is."

684
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,920
 And so I know everyone here for a fact,

685
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,360
 if you're saying you wanna have a relationship with Jesus,

686
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,920
 or you say you have one, you're saying you wanna grow,

687
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,200
 and if you're not saying you wanna grow,

688
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,760
 then it might be because you don't have

689
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,860
 a relationship with Jesus.

690
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,480
 Because at that time at church camp

691
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,880
 where you committed your life to Him,

692
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,440
 it was never for you just to go home

693
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,760
 and wait for Jesus to return.

694
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,760
 It was for you to grow your faith so it becomes beautiful

695
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,240
 and it becomes attractive to a watching world.

696
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,700
 And I always wonder what would my life look like

697
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,720
 if I never plugged into community?

698
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,800
 I might be an addict.

699
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,200
 I mean, I could be lying and cheating and stealing.

700
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,960
 Man, I could be this person that takes advantage of others.

701
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,880
 I mean, I could be the all-star tailgater

702
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,560
 at the Cowboys game talking about how I never made it,

703
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,060
 getting drunk before the game.

704
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,920
 I could be playing video games

705
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,880
 at a really unhealthy level in my parents' house.

706
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,800
 And I just think back, it's like,

707
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,380
 God, man, if I never made that decision,

708
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,400
 if you never caused me to have a desire

709
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,280
 to step out in faith and say, yes, I trust you,

710
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,620
 even though this is hard,

711
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,860
 I wonder what my life would look like.

712
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,400
 'Cause I get people come up to me all the time

713
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,920
 and they say, hey, what's God's will for my life?

714
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,040
 And the answer that I,

715
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,060
 or the question that I respond to is this,

716
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,160
 do you have community?

717
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,760
 Well, there was this time where,

718
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,120
 man, I got into community and there was this conflict

719
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,100
 and it just kind of broke off.

720
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,920
 Man, there was this time where I got in community

721
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,740
 and there was some people

722
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,640
 that just began to talk bad about me.

723
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,680
 And man, I just kind of walked away.

724
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,200
 There was this time where there was some people

725
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
 that really weren't committed

726
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,240
 and I just decided not to be committed either.

727
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,000
 There was this time when I walked in

728
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,520
 and man, these people are weird.

729
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,860
 They're just weird, man.

730
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,200
 And so I just say, all right,

731
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
 well then, man, with all the love that I can share with you,

732
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,320
 don't complain that you can't hear from God

733
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,800
 because one of God's greatest provisions in our life

734
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,240
 is he gives us trusted men and women who love him

735
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,900
 and are a voice for him in our life.

736
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,760
 Listen, I'm not trying to beat you up.

737
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,520
 Like I get it, community is hard.

738
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,680
 I've made the same excuses before.

739
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,560
 I mean, just recently, I'll close with this.

740
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,460
 About 10 months ago, I moved to Dallas from Kansas City.

741
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,400
 And man, things were going well in Kansas City.

742
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,560
 Ministry was growing and things were comfortable

743
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
 and I had my community.

744
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,600
 I had men in my life that I cherished and I loved

745
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,160
 and man, God began to continue to move.

746
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,480
 But then all of a sudden out of nowhere,

747
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,320
 which God does this sometimes,

748
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,440
 he began to lay this move to Dallas

749
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,400
 and be a part of Watermark Church and the porch

750
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,220
 on my wife and I's heart.

751
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,100
 And so we couldn't shake it anymore

752
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,120
 and we decided to make a decision to move to Dallas.

753
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,920
 And so we got in the car and packed up all of our stuff

754
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,480
 and drove down with my two little girls.

755
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,200
 And let me just be honest,

756
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,960
 man, this has been one of the hardest seasons of my life.

757
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,420
 And I actually started to pursue community and it got hard.

758
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,720
 And there was a little bit of conflict.

759
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,960
 And I caught myself saying the same excuses

760
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,580
 that I hear other people make.

761
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,180
 Oh man, it's hard and then there's this conflict

762
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
 and people just don't understand me.

763
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,620
 Man, people just, they don't understand a move.

764
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,900
 Like they don't understand what we've gone through.

765
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,720
 And I started making excuses after excuses

766
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,680
 until I had a couple of men in my life

767
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,120
 sharpen me like Proverbs 27, six says,

768
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,960
 "Faithful are the wounds of a friend,

769
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
 but an enemy multiplies kiss."

770
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,980
 And they said, "Hey, you gotta keep pursuing it.

771
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,560
 You can't just check out Josiah.

772
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,720
 This is the worst time for you to check out."

773
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,580
 And they began to love me and push me into community

774
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,840
 where now I'm seeing God move like never before.

775
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,040
 And listen, I want that for you tonight.

776
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,520
 More importantly, God wants that for you tonight

777
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,580
 where you can experience what we've been talking about

778
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,280
 even though I know it's hard

779
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,840
 and I don't wanna be insensitive.

780
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,740
 But in the same way I had brothers come into my life

781
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,960
 and tell me what I didn't wanna hear,

782
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,200
 in the same way I'm sharing this tonight

783
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,960
 because some of you who are listening need to hear this.

784
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,840
 And so tonight, let me pray that you would.

785
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,640
 God in heaven, Lord, we need you.

786
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,320
 I need you.

787
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,160
 This has been an incredible reminder for me

788
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,160
 that when I don't want to read your word

789
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:09,440
 and do what it says, you put people in my life

790
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,280
 to challenge my thinking, to encourage me,

791
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,280
 to push me to places where I don't wanna go.

792
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,320
 And I've said this over and over tonight,

793
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,840
 but I thank you, God,

794
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,020
 because that is one of your greatest provisions.

795
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,660
 And I pray for my friends who are listening to this tonight

796
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,660
 that they would understand your will for their life

797
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,640
 when it comes to community,

798
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,160
 when it comes to people in their life

799
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,360
 that you want to introduce them to

800
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,240
 and you want them to lock arms with.

801
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,840
 And I pray that they would stop at nothing until they do.

802
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,760
 I don't care what barriers come into their life

803
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,200
 to try to keep them from community.

804
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,400
 God, would you push through those barriers

805
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,360
 and would you give them the power

806
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
 and would you give them the strength

807
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,360
 to do what only you can do.

808
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,040
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

809
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:11,040
