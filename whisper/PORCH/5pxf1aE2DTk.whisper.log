[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.760]   Hey, welcome friends in the room, friends in Fort Worth, El Paso, Phoenix,
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.640]   Nashville, Austin, Houston, wherever you are listening in from tonight.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.760]   We are wrapping up this series, Jesus Walks, so
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.840]   there will no longer be a Kanye West intro bumper.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.040]   Sadly, unless we start next week's series off with that, which maybe who knows.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.760]   So if you're listening online, you can't hear that because we don't have the
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.880]   copyright rights to it, so you just heard some other tune on there.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.880]   But hey, either way, we are finishing up this series.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.080]   And anybody live in the M Streets in this area?
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.000]   Good, three of you, awesome.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.360]   The epicenter of young adults.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.280]   Hey, when my wife and I got married, we moved into a place that's duplex in
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.280]   the M Streets, which if you're listening, is just an area of Dallas that is kind
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.000]   of a lot of young adults, families, it's kind of South Dallas by Mockingbird.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.560]   It's not really the point, but point being, we moved into this duplex, and
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.480]   it was the first home that we lived in together.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.840]   We got ready to move everything in.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.640]   We met the guy who was living there before us, and while he was moving,
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.960]   he said, hey, this TV is attached to the wall.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   I don't really wanna take it down.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.840]   I'm moving to Chicago.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.400]   I'm gonna be in a place where I can't really use it.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.760]   I'll give you guys a great deal.
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.720]   This was when smart TVs were really brand new, and so it was not just a smart TV.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.640]   It was like the nicest TV I'd ever seen.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.360]   He gave it to us at basically half off.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.480]   It was like sold, and it had this feature to it that I'd never seen before.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.040]   I still haven't seen it to this day, where you could watch any show you want in 3D.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.560]   You guys seen this before?
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.080]   No?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.160]   Yes, some of you have?
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   I don't even know if this is a thing, but on this TV, you could watch any TV show
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.960]   that you wanted to in 3D, but there was one catch to it.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.240]   In order to watch it, you had to put on the 3D glasses in order to watch.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.560]   And these weren't like the 3D glasses from the 1990s when you were in the IMAX theater.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.960]   These were like next level.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.920]   You gotta turn them on.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.040]   They basically look like they come from NASA or something, and they allow you to watch any TV show
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.880]   that you want in total 3D.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.040]   So you, like, sit there, you're watching The Office, and it's like they're coming out of the TV at you,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.760]   or whatever show, Parks and Rec, whatever your thing is, you can watch these shows,
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.320]   and it's all in three dimension.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.960]   The funny thing is, it's not that practical, because as great as it sounds on the surface,
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.560]   like as a dude and just like someone who likes tech stuff, I was like,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.880]   "Babe, this is gonna be amazing.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400]   We're gonna watch everything in 3D.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.280]   We're gonna watch the news.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.920]   It's gonna be coming out at us."
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.560]   And it's very impractical, because you'd be shocked how often your wife is not like,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.480]   "All right, I'm ready.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.560]   Go."
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.560]   You know?
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.760]   It's like, we use it like three times.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.120]   But those three times we did use it, or I tried to...
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.840]   I was more of a buyer than she was.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.440]   So she would come in, and I would be watching something in 3D, and she'd be like,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.600]   "What are you watching right now?"
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.160]   And she wouldn't put the glasses on, and she would begin to like try to make out exactly what's
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.720]   happening, because you can kind of see it.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.960]   It's fuzzy, if you remember seeing things in 3D.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.280]   But until you put those glasses on, everything's out of focus.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.200]   It's hard to make out exactly what's going on.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.840]   So if you're watching a movie, and you don't have the glasses on, it's hard to exactly see what's
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.920]   happening, because not everything is in...or most things are not in focus, and just like it's a warped,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.760]   it's a fuzzier perspective on what's taking place.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.680]   And the reason I start there is because in that same way, without having the ability,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.400]   without putting on the lenses of the 3D glasses to see in a 3D TV, in this series,
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.160]   "Jesus Walks," what we've been attempting to do is look at what the gospel writers,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.200]   inside of the New Testament, the gospel writers means Matthew, Mark, Luke, John,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.600]   what they essentially were attempting to do.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.320]   And as we collectively look together, and to see or to find in focus Jesus.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.000]   In other words, when we read the stories and lives and the different things that we've been going
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.200]   through the past six weeks, what we've been attempting to do is help the image of who Jesus is,
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.960]   his character, his characteristics, all of those things go from kind of this fuzzy,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.400]   abstract, "I kind of know who Jesus is," to putting you in front of...or putting him in front
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.360]   of you and in front of me, and us looking and seeing, "Man, this is actually what Jesus is like.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.400]   When he walked on this planet, when Jesus walked, this is what he was like."
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.180]   There's few tragedies that maybe could be worse than someone who spends time in church,
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.400]   maybe grew up in church, maybe claims to be a Christian, and having a fuzzy or a flawed
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.800]   or warped view of what Jesus is like.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.360]   A lot of us came into the room tonight, and it's as though you have some idea of what Jesus is like.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.200]   You may have grown up in church, you know some of the Bible stories,
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.280]   you know kind of what he's like, but you have a fuzzy picture of him.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.320]   Like for you, you may not describe it this way, but when you think about God,
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.280]   when you think about Jesus, you think of some, like, sheriff up in the sky who's just kind
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.020]   of waiting to pull you over if you get too much out of line.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.320]   He's waiting to send down lightning bolts, and he's almost like a referee that's there to,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.420]   like, call you out and punish you whenever you go out of bounds or you step off sides.
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.640]   Others of you may think of God, I mean, this is a really common one,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.000]   where the perspective that you have is fuzzy and it's flawed, and you think of God almost
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.800]   like this, like, hippie God up in the sky who's kind of like, "Dude, love is love.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.920]   It's all chill.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.400]   Do whatever you want in whatever windmill.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.080]   It's all cool."
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.320]   And that's how you think of God.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.280]   But regardless, all of us came into the room, and to the degree that we do not see Jesus
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.920]   as he is, to that degree, our life, our experience of where meaning is found,
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.000]   our experience of what is important in this life and really what matters in the end is
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   going to be flawed.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.160]   Your ability to experience joy, your experience of anxiety is all directly
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.280]   connected to your ability and my ability to see Jesus, to know who he is,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.040]   to know what he's like.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.680]   Because in knowing what he is like, it puts everything else in life into focus.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.240]   It begins to bring all the fuzziness of what life is about into focus,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.640]   just like putting 3D glasses on.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.000]   So tonight, we're going to look at three interactions that the resurrected Jesus has
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.360]   as we finish this series.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.640]   We're going to be in John 20 and John 21.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.920]   I'm going to hammer home this idea of 3D because we're going to look at 3D adjectives,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.440]   or three words that start with the letter D, that showcase his interactions with these
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.120]   three men and women on Jesus's resurrection day.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.360]   Specifically, we're going to look at how Jesus welcomes the desperate,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.240]   we welcomes the doubting, and how Jesus is a God.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.680]   The God who's there is a God who welcomes the disgrace of people.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.520]   We're going to look at these three adjectives, and hopefully,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.920]   by the end of the night, all of us have a little bit more clear
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.560]   perspective as we just open and we read from John, one of Jesus's best friends.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   This is what the Son of God, this is what God in the flesh is really like.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.920]   And if you come to know him, this is who you're going to get to come to know.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.160]   So we're going to look at the first one that comes from John 20.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.120]   It's one of my favorite stories in this whole series that we're covering.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.800]   It's honestly one of those stories that, for whatever reason,
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.240]   it, like, emotionally connects with me in a way that I don't even know that I can put
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.640]   it into words, but there's just something so powerful as we look at Jesus's
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.000]   interaction with this desperate woman.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.960]   So let me set up what's happening in verse...
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.640]   We'll pick it up in verse 11, but here's what happens.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.000]   So Jesus dies, he goes to the cross, he's crucified, he's buried inside of a tomb.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.680]   We read the story and we think like in light of the ending, because we kind of all
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.600]   know the ending, they're like, "Yeah, guys, everything, you know,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.920]   Sunday's coming, that's it."
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.000]   When they were experiencing the story, the disciples, the followers of Jesus,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.720]   the woman we're about to look at who is a follower of Jesus,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.320]   they don't think like we think.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.520]   In other words, sometimes I think that we think that the disciples, you know,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.640]   "Jesus is dead," but they're like, "Hey, it's going to be great.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.240]   He's coming back.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.320]   Sunday's coming."
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.200]   And they gathered outside of the tomb for a big tailgate and they're like waiting
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.480]   for Sunday and all of a sudden the ground's rumbling and they're like,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.760]   "It's come, 10, 9, and so Jesus is going to bust out."
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.000]   And they're like, "He's here."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.880]   They didn't see it that way.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   They thought it was over.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.760]   The guy that they've been following for the last three years,
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.640]   the guy that they've seen raise dead people to life, give sight to blind eyes,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.840]   he's dead.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.600]   He was the guy who was going to conquer the Roman Empire.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.720]   He was the guy who was going to turn everything around for our country,
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.560]   for our people, for us.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.160]   And if we followed him, we'd live forever.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.520]   Now, he doesn't even live forever.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.280]   I mean, their world is shattered.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.240]   And so early on the first day of the week, which is Sunday,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.440]   that's the third day, we're told that Mary goes to the tomb.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   She's going to the burial site.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.800]   This is essentially akin to somebody going to the burial place of someone that they
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.760]   love and, you know, you go, you bring flowers.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's kind of a place where you have closure.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.520]   She goes to the tomb, and it's early in the morning on Sunday.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.680]   And she gets to the tomb, and she sees what all of us know that she sees,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.360]   but she didn't see it coming.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.560]   The stone is rolled away.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.080]   The tomb, when they buried Jesus, it's empty.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.760]   She takes off running.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.080]   She goes and gets John and Peter, and she brings both of them,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.480]   and all of them come back to the tomb.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.720]   And Peter and John were told they look in, and they're all just confused on what
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.520]   happened.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.480]   And we think, "Of course you know what happened.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.120]   He rose from the dead."
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.760]   That's not what they thought.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.000]   She begins to explain, like, "Frantically, somebody has stolen the
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   body of Jesus."
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.160]   The one thing in this life that I had, I mean, I just lost the guy that I banked
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.200]   everything on.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.400]   And now I don't even have a place where I can come bring flowers at his grave because
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.240]   they stole the body.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.160]   And she begins to weep, so let's pick it up in verse 11.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.120]   "Now Mary stood outside of the tomb crying."
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.760]   The word "crying" there is "kaleo" in Greek.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.560]   It's not the ordinary crying.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.640]   It's literally translated "sobbing" or "wailing out loud."
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.560]   This is like she's full-blown ugly cry right now going on.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.760]   She's just losing it.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.520]   She thinks the body of Jesus is gone, the one last thing that she had.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.560]   As she bent over to look into the tomb, she saw two angels in white seated there
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:56.160]   where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.000]   And they asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?"
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.360]   "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I do not know where they have put him."
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.200]   At this, she turned around and she saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   it was Jesus.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.440]   And he asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.040]   Who is it that you are looking for?"
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:23.520]   Thinking that Jesus was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.560]   tell me where you have put him and I will get him."
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:36.560]   And Jesus said to her, "Mary," and she turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni,"
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.560]   which means "teacher."
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.520]   We're told that Jesus says her name, she realizes it's Jesus, and she throws her arms around
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   him in the next verses and he holds on to her, or she holds on to him and Jesus says,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.520]   "Hey, I've got to go ascend and go tell other people, 'Don't hold on to me.'"
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:59.720]   And we're given a glimpse into how God deals with the desperate.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.280]   We're given really a parallel into your story if you're a Christian and my story as a Christian.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.280]   What do I mean by that?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.080]   Mary, Mary Magdalene, there's a lot of Marys in the Bible.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.800]   I don't know if you know this, there's like Mary the mother of Jesus, there's Mary the
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.320]   mother of Cleopas, whoever that was.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.240]   There's different Marys that played roles.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.320]   There's Mary in Luke 7 who breaks kind of the perfume and rubs it on Jesus' feet, but
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.440]   Mary Magdalene, dude, this girl had a story.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   What do I mean?
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.880]   In Luke chapter 8, we're told Mary Magdalene became a follower of Jesus and it was after
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.920]   Jesus healed her from seven demon possessions that she was a woman who was possessed by
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.480]   seven demons.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.080]   Now when you're possessed by one demon, that's a bad day.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:47.960]   When you've got seven, you've got a holiday inn of demons running on your house.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.200]   That can't be good.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.680]   And yet Jesus shows up to this woman, and we're not even told the story of how it all
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.640]   went down, but she shows up, she meets Jesus one day, and we're told that he casts out
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.020]   the demons, he healed this woman, her whole world changed, everything changed.
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.960]   She followed him for years, for the few years that he was around on this planet, and she
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.560]   believed he was the Messiah, he was everything.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.080]   She banged everything on this guy.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.120]   And now he's dead and it's over and it's gone.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:21.520]   And who he thought she was, or who she thought Jesus was, she's thinking, "I was wrong."
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.000]   She's confused.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.420]   We're told that she's so desperate, I mean, it almost reads, what we're told is that Peter
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.680]   and John, like they go to the tomb, they're like, "Man, what happened?
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.240]   I guess let's go back to our life."
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.800]   Mary doesn't go anywhere.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.480]   It's like she didn't have a life to go back to.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.040]   And she's just weeping and bawling.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.760]   You know the last person that the cross was?
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.560]   Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.240]   I mean, I think the power of just the story, it almost makes it like emotional, just he
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.360]   was everything.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.640]   And now I'm weeping because everything that I thought about world, the world, the reality,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.480]   where life is found, it's all been shattered.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:21.240]   And in a moment, everything changes with a word where Jesus says, "Mary," and she realizes,
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.720]   "Who is speaking to me?"
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.920]   He's alive.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.520]   He rose from the dead, just like he said he would, though he didn't fully understand it.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.440]   And everything in a moment changes.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.280]   The reason it's such a parallel to the Christian experience is the Bible says that Jesus is
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.960]   a good shepherd in John chapter 10, and it says he's a shepherd that he calls his sheep
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.960]   by name, and they know his voice, and they follow him.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.420]   And Mary did what every Christian who's ever lived did in that moment where Jesus speaks
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:53.040]   their name, and in doing so, awakens their eyes to see he's alive.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.920]   He's who he said he was.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.760]   He's the Messiah, the Savior, the Savior of my sins.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760]   Mary was desperate.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   In the Christian, what does desperate mean?
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.400]   It means I'll go to great extremes because I have great need.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.400]   I have nowhere else to turn, nowhere else to look to.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:16.880]   And in similar parallel fashion, the Christian life begins by you understanding that you
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.240]   are desperate.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.720]   Jesus welcomes the desperate into having a relationship with him.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.920]   What do I mean by desperate?
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.120]   I mean like Mary, those who realize they have a great need.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.320]   We're desperate in our own way.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.200]   And if you're ever going to become a Christian, it comes by you starting to realize, "Man,
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.120]   I am desperate and in need of a God to save me.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.720]   If I'm going to have a relationship with God, it is not by me doing a bunch of good things.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.920]   It is by God in his mercy, in an unexplained, undeserving way, calling my name and allowing
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   me to see he's alive."
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.880]   That's what Christians believe.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.880]   You know that, right?
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.040]   I think that the fuzzy view, if you will, to use that illustration of 3D stuff, the
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.440]   fuzzy dimension is the perspective that many people in our world have where they kind of
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.360]   think they can see what's going on.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.080]   And here's what that looks like as it relates to desperate.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.880]   They think that God, the God who's there, doesn't welcome the desperate, which is the
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   first point.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.920]   He's a God who welcomes those who have it all together.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.440]   He's a God who welcomes those who kind of live pretty good lives.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.920]   And that's the type of person that God welcomes into his arms.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.520]   And the Bible says the only ones that have a relationship with Jesus are those who say,
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.520]   "I am in need.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.300]   I bring nothing to the table, and yet God accepts me.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.120]   No matter how good of a person I think I am, no matter how bad I am, none of that matters.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:38.280]   " In terms of having a relationship with Jesus, and he goes and he welcomes the desperate.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.080]   And it's only those who see themselves as desperate who will have a relationship with
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.080]   him.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:52.120]   In so many ways, he operates distinctly opposite of how most of us interact with someone that
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.400]   we perceive to be desperate as it relates to having a relationship.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.000]   Like whenever you're dating somebody, we've all been in that experience, or a lot of us
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.240]   have been in this experience where you sit down and like in two seconds, you're like,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.440]   "Dude, this person is desperate."
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.000]   And is there anything less attractive when they're like, "Hey, look, okay.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.840]   I've got a note on my phone with the names of our children that if we just ended up working
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.280]   out together, and I'm just hoping that this will be great.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.280]   Really whatever you think about life, I'm great.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.280]   I'm just looking for a...
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.440]   I'm looking to get booed up.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.040]   And so if this is something that you're open to, is there anything less attractive than
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.960]   someone who's like, "Look, I got no other options."
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.560]   They're texting you every five seconds.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.680]   You've been on one date and they're showing up to your work like, "Hey, I'm just changing
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.160]   things in your office and this is going to be great."
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.580]   Is there anything where you're like, "Oh man, that girl, she has got seven kinds of crazy
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.720]   going on and it's unattractive.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   It's weird."
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.040]   Like being honest, dude, some of you guys don't text back immediately even though you
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.240]   see the text when it's someone of the opposite sex, because you're like, "Look, I don't want
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   to come off too intense.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.320]   And so I'm going to let it lie for a second.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.040]   And so maybe I'll cause the dots to leave them wanting a little bit."
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:08.040]   Am I right?
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.280]   Because if somebody's desperate, we're like, we know people don't want to have a relationship
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.800]   if somebody's desperate.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.200]   The only type of people that Jesus will have a relationship with are those who are desperate.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.880]   Those who see their need for a savior.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.000]   Those who don't say, "Man, I bring a lot to the table and you know, God, I've been doing
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.840]   a lot of good things, know a lot of Bible verses, go to church a lot here at the porch."
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.160]   That should earn me a relationship with you.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.120]   That is not what the Bible teaches.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.940]   It teaches that God is there, welcomes those who see themselves as God.
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.960]   You alone are the only hope that I have of eternal life.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   If I'm going to have access to knowing and walking with you, it's not going to be by
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.440]   how good of a person I am.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:52.000]   But Jesus shows us the first D, which is that he's a God who welcomes the desperate.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.080]   Second story comes, and it's probably more familiar to, it's related to a guy who ended
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.840]   up getting a nickname.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.320]   And that was around the idea of doubting.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   And that is doubting, anybody know?
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   Thomas.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   Come on, dude.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.440]   We've got some Bible scholars here.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.320]   Thomas brings us our second D and we're told that there was a, later on this day.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.040]   So that morning he appears to Mary and then later that night, Jesus goes and he goes to
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.440]   see the disciples and they're hanging out in what's called the upper room.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.560]   Like they were just up there.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.960]   They didn't know what was happening.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   They didn't know what to do now.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.000]   Jesus there, the one that they banked their life on is dead.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.320]   So they think, and they're hanging out and it says that they've got the doors locked
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.160]   because they're afraid of what the religious leaders are going to do to us.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.480]   We just saw what they did to Jesus.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.280]   They're all hanging out and Jesus shows up and he like straight walks through the wall
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   and he's like, "What's up guys?"
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   It's like savage Jesus.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.160]   He just comes through the wall.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.160]   I don't need a door.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160]   I don't need anything.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.160]   And he's totally resurrected.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.720]   Like it's not like some ghost or anything.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.320]   In fact, they're like, "Oh man, is this a ghost?"
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.280]   And Jesus is like, "No, touch me.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   This is real deal."
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.560]   In fact, is that fish right there?
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:59.440]   And he begins to eat some of the food to like show or it displays, man, it's totally resurrected
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   physical body.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.320]   It's not some ghost, but there was one disciple not there.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   Thomas.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:11.080]   Thomas was out getting pita bread or whatever, you know, the grocery store they had back
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.400]   then and he missed it.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.360]   And he comes back home and all the disciples are like, "Dude, you just missed Jesus.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.560]   Jesus was just here."
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.800]   Like he was here, we're hanging out and he like showed up in the room, was like, "You
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   got any fish?"
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   It was crazy.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.160]   And he let us see the scars in his hands and on his side.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.720]   And Thomas basically goes, "You guys are crazy.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.920]   I will not believe that."
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   Here's what it says.
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:40.360]   So when the other disciples, verse 25 of chapter 20, told him that we have seen the Lord, but
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.520]   he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and I put my finger where the
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.440]   nails were and I put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.160]   A week later, his disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.880]   Though the doors were locked, Jesus came in and he stood among them and he said, "Peace
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.240]   be with you."
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:09.760]   And then he turned to Thomas, the one who had doubted him, the one who had seen everything
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:17.320]   that he had done, the one who demanded that he prove himself to Thomas.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.120]   And what does he say?
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.400]   "Thomas, put your finger here in my hand.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.920]   Reach out your hand and put it into my side.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.240]   Stop doubting and believe."
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.720]   And Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God."
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:42.040]   And then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you believed."
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.920]   And he says something that's true about you if you're a Christian, which is next.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:54.960]   "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:21:01.040]   The amount of humility it would take to be God in the flesh and to say, "Man, I'm going
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.360]   to go out of my way to go back to care for Thomas," this one doubting person.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.200]   He doesn't shun Thomas for his doubts.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.520]   He doesn't dismiss him.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.760]   It doesn't disqualify him.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.360]   He moves towards him as though God is like, "Man, that's okay.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   Come here.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.400]   You can come see it."
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.200]   The God who's there, the second idea, the second D in the 3D is that the God who's there
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.360]   is a God who welcomes the doubting.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.740]   He welcomes the doubting.
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.220]   And Thomas sees Jesus and it's as though he puts on the glasses and he sees more clearly,
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:35.380]   "My God, my Lord."
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.700]   But what you need to know, if you're in the room, Jesus doesn't shun or shy away from
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.380]   those who have doubts.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.660]   He moves towards them.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.660]   He's a God who welcomes it.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.380]   If you have doubts and you've ever experienced doubts, here's what you need to know.
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.380]   You are in great company.
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.300]   In other words, sometimes, like the message, people like feel if they're a Christian and
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.580]   they're in church, they feel like, "Man, I can't even be honest about the fact that sometimes
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.900]   I'm like, 'Dude, I don't know if I believe everything exactly inside of this book or
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:08.180]   I just have questions that I feel like I can't be honest and wrestle with.'"
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.820]   And that is a lie.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.820]   You don't need to be ashamed.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.820]   You don't need to be afraid.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.580]   You don't need to be unwilling to explore or to ask questions to seek answers to those
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.340]   questions.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.460]   And you need to know that God, while you're doing so and as you do so, because all of
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:28.180]   us are going to face doubts in life and anyone who tells you you won't is a liar.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.420]   But while you do so, you need to know that God doesn't shun you.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:35.100]   He welcomes the doubting.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.980]   And so if there's questions you're wondering, here would be the practical encouragement
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.260]   that I would give you.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.900]   Seek answers to the questions.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.180]   Like there are libraries and books and all kinds of resources to questions.
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.340]   The worst thing you can do is to stop on doubt.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.020]   It's like playing a board game of Monopoly and, "Hey, don't stop on doubt.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.860]   Don't stop on doubt."
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.620]   Let those drive you towards seeking answers to the questions.
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.620]   Here's what's true.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.780]   If Christianity is true, you don't need to be afraid of asking questions.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.140]   Like it's not like you're going to pull the one card and everything, the whole thing collapses.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.140]   Ask questions.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.300]   Seek answers to your questions.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.940]   It's been said that if something is true, no amount of scrutiny can take it down.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.940]   And so ask questions.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.820]   And if you can't ask questions and we can't be certain that it's true, dude, we should
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.860]   shut this whole thing down and find a much better place to go on a Tuesday night.
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.700]   There's probably a good happy hour deal somewhere or there's something else that we could do.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:28.160]   But if it is true, then there's no better use of our time than knowing God and walking
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.180]   with his people, seeking to live on purpose for him.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.860]   But you do not need to be afraid of asking questions.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.820]   All throughout the New Testament, there's people who experienced doubt.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.300]   We're told that John the Baptist, you guys heard of John the Baptist?
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.300]   He's not the first Baptist.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.220]   He just was a guy that baptized people.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.620]   And John showed up and we're told Jesus said, "Hey, there's never been someone born of a
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:55.140]   woman," which is everybody, "who is greater than John."
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:01.220]   And in John's last days on the planet, he sends a letter to Jesus, who he knew his whole
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.740]   life, who he was raised up with, who was his cousin.
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.740]   And he says, "I'm sitting in this jail cell.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:12.300]   I just need to know, Jesus, are you sure you're the Messiah?
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.500]   Because I feel like if you were, you would change my circumstances right now."
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   And in the face of pain and disappointment, he doubted.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.260]   We're even told that the disciples in Matthew chapter eight, as Jesus gives a great commission,
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.260]   remember the great commission?
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.620]   It's a really famous, you've probably heard it.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:31.140]   Go into all the world and make disciples and baptize them in the name of the Father, the
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.940]   Son, and the Holy Spirit, and lo, I'm with you always to the end of the age.
[00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.760]   As he's doing that, we're told that Jesus ascends to heaven.
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.220]   And as he does, it tells us in the text that the disciples were gathered around and watching
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.100]   Jesus ascend, kind of levitate up towards heaven.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:53.300]   And as he's doing so, it says, "And they saw him, and some worshipped him, and some doubted."
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.980]   Think about that.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.620]   They're seeing Jesus levitate up in the air, and some are like, "Ah, I don't know.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.380]   David Blaine does the same thing.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.340]   I'm not totally convinced."
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.340]   I mean, think about it.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.500]   Like, you may be sitting here, and you're like, "Did he really ascend?
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   What was that like?
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.780]   I wish I could have seen that."
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.340]   People who saw that doubted.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.860]   Did he really do it?
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.140]   And so you need to know, and those were disciples who followed Jesus.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.420]   It is a normal part of the human experience and the Christian experience to experience
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.780]   doubts, but it is not okay to stop on doubt.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.020]   Let those doubts drive you towards seeking answers.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:33.820]   You do not need to be afraid of the answers or of truth, because as a follower of Jesus,
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.580]   truth is yours, and all truth is God's.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.580]   And so let it drive you.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.820]   Here's two resources if you have questions.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.380]   One is, could be just for friends you have, one is gotquestions.org.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.380]   Gotquestions.org.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.020]   There's over 500,000 different questions that have been asked.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.460]   I am confident whatever question you have likely is on there.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.060]   Another one is something we do the second Tuesday of the month here at The Porch called
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.060]   Great Questions.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.940]   It's just a chance for, if you have questions wherever you are wrestling in terms of faith,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.380]   for you to come and ask those questions.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.140]   If you are someone wrestling to believe, I hear this every single week, "Man, I want
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.300]   to believe.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.940]   I want to believe that Jesus is who he says he is.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.100]   He died in my place and he rose from the grave.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.340]   I'm struggling to get there.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.380]   I can think it, I just don't know.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.100]   I'm struggling to get there."
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:23.380]   I want you to pray one prayer just this week.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.100]   "God, if you are real, will you reveal yourself to me?
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.380]   God, if you are real, will you reveal yourself to me?
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.140]   God, if you are real, will you reveal yourself to me?"
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:43.820]   But be careful, if that is a question, he longs and often likely answers.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.220]   He longs to answer and often likely does.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.320]   And ultimately, at the end of the day, here's what I know.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.060]   You want to know God more than you want answers to your questions.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.060]   So do I.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.820]   As much as I want to know the answers to everything, how exactly does the problem of evil and pain
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.300]   and all of that work and, you know, the creation, was it seven literal days and how did the
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.100]   dinosaurs fit on the boat?
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.420]   All those different great questions.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.260]   There's a great answer to that one.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:16.940]   Not that, we're not going to go there right now, but I want to know Jesus more than I
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.740]   want answers.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.740]   And I know you do too.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:24.740]   And it's not just because I'm like, "Yeah, yay, motivational."
[00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.740]   You do.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.260]   Like, if Jesus showed up to your room tonight and he woke you up and he was like, "Hey,
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.260]   it's Jesus.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.340]   What's up?"
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.140]   You would not pull out your list of questions and be like, "Oh, it's you.
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.140]   Huh?
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.140]   Let's start from the top."
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.500]   So seven literal days, you would go, "It's real.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.100]   He's alive."
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:50.140]   Because you want to know him more than you want answers to your questions.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:52.060]   We all do.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.940]   And so if you're wrestling to believe, this week, the challenge I would give you is to
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.860]   begin to ask God, "If you're real, will you reveal yourself to me?"
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:04.460]   Ultimately, it is not the amount of your faith or the strength and size of your faith, but
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.140]   it is what your faith is in that matters most.
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.140]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.100]   Because sometimes we have this idea, the flawed, fuzzy view here, before you put on the glasses
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:17.340]   here, the fuzzy view would be that God welcomes or loves those who are just full of faith,
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.420]   huge amounts of faith.
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.180]   And the truth is, it is not how much faith that you have that matters in terms of having
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.620]   a relationship with God and where you spend eternity.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.620]   It is what your faith is in.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.620]   Here's what I mean.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.620]   Tim Keller pointed out in a book called Reason for God, which is a great resource, if you
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:41.100]   have questions or people in general, and he pointed out that if I was on the side of a
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.380]   mountain and I was losing my grip on the side of the mountain, and I'm hanging there and
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.820]   I'm losing my grip, and I look over and I see a tree branch right there that I could
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:52.860]   grab, and if I could hold onto it, I could pull myself to safety, and I know that I'm
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.780]   slipping off of this thing.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.780]   I have a decision.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.140]   Am I going to grab the tree branch or just kind of fall off to my death?
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:04.260]   In that moment, what matters most is not how confident I am that that tree branch can hold
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.260]   me.
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.540]   If I have a lot of confidence, it'll hold me, or if I have a little bit of confidence,
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.260]   that it'll hold me.
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.580]   Matters less than if it will hold me.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.140]   In other words, if I'm like, "Dude, it's for sure going to hold me," and then I grab and
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:24.780]   I fall, that matters less, or that matters more than however much confidence I have.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.540]   The question is, can it hold you?
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.260]   The Bible says whether it is the size of a mustard seed faith or something far bigger
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.940]   than that, what matters most is whether or not you are holding onto Christ, because he's
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.180]   strong enough to hold you.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.460]   In other words, what saves a Christian is not the strength of their faith.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.980]   It is the strength of Jesus.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.400]   If you're going to have a relationship with him and know, you need to know.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.500]   You don't have to deal with all of your doubts before you come to trust in Jesus.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.320]   You should deal with them, and you should seek answers, and you should know it's a safe
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.340]   place to be filled with doubts.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:56.580]   I have doubts at times.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:03.020]   I have probably doubts every week, whether they're related to just different things,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:07.300]   or what exactly all happened here.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.940]   Reading some of the stuff in the Old Testament, candidly, one of the things that I doubt most
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.580]   is like, "God, you really love me?
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.420]   Really?
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:25.580]   Could you really be as scandalous in love as it seems to present in the Bible, and as
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:29.900]   for my good as you seem to say?"
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.820]   Yet those are doubts that I have the choice to, I'm either going to allow that to drive
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.980]   me back to seeking answers and drive me back to him, or I'm just going to stay in that
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.980]   fog and let it paralyze me.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.720]   But let me be abundantly clear.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:47.740]   Some of you, your problem is not that like, "Man, I've got these doubts, and I just can't
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.740]   find answers."
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.940]   You don't want answers.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.100]   All the questions for some of you, not all of you, maybe not even most, but this for
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.540]   sure, I've just been doing this a while.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.900]   There's people inside of this room that are like, "Dude, hey, it's not that I can't believe
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.900]   it's true.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.380]   I don't want to believe it's true yet, because if it is, then I may have to change some things.
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.540]   I may have to not date the way that I've been dating, and I may have to move out with him,
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.460]   and I may have to make some changes in my job, and I may have to do some things differently
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.180]   and spend my time a little bit differently."
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.820]   You're like, "You just throw up the smoke screens.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.460]   Well, you know we can't really trust that, and you throw up smoke screen after smoke
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.460]   screen."
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.860]   You don't want the answers to those questions.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.420]   You just want to hide behind them, and you're missing out.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.820]   That is it.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.820]   You're missing out on purpose.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.700]   You're missing out on seeing the reality of the world around you, and you stay behind
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.580]   that fuzzy wall, but you like it there.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.820]   Just be honest.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.900]   Stop hiding behind, "There's just too many doubts that I have," and just say, "I want
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.860]   to be my own God.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.220]   I want to be God of my life, and I don't want to change things."
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:58.100]   Don't hide behind doubts, because if they're there, seek answers.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.460]   The final D that we see as we wrap up just the 3D or three dimensions here of seeing
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:07.700]   Jesus in 3D is related to Jesus' best friend.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:12.540]   It happens in John chapter 21 in his interaction with Peter.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:20.220]   It says this, "Afterward, Jesus appeared again to his disciples by the Sea of Galilee."
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.860]   This is the last chapter of the book of John.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.740]   It happened this way.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:32.540]   Simon Peter, Thomas, also known as Didymus, Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.980]   Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.020]   Let me just pause.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.260]   This is hilarious to me, because he says, this is John, right?
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.940]   He's like, "We had Peter there.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.940]   We had Thomas.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.060]   He was also known as Didymus, and we had Nathaniel.
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.060]   He's from Cana.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.060]   That's in Galilee.
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.060]   Then we had the sons of Zebedee.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.840]   Zebedee's their dad, and then there were two other guys."
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.120]   This is like the ultimate…
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:59.140]   When somebody posts a picture on Instagram and they tag everybody but you, only it's
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.740]   in the Bible for all time.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:04.100]   It's like, "Dude, John, we got names, bro.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.360]   Why didn't you mention us?"
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.860]   That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:15.720]   It just was too much shade, John.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:21.980]   Peter said this, "I am going out to fish."
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:24.820]   They said that, "We'll go with you."
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:31.140]   They went out, and they got in the boat, but that night, they caught nothing.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:38.920]   Peter does what so many of us do, and they face a failure and shame.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.060]   We go back to our old life.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.320]   We go away from God and our relationship with Him.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.860]   We run from our purpose.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.820]   We kind of just wallow in shame and guilt.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.820]   Why do I say that?
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.900]   Because Peter, when he says, "I'm going fishing," this wasn't a dude's trip.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.460]   This is what Peter used to do for a living.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.460]   He was a fisherman.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.940]   Until Jesus showed up one day and He said, "Peter, you're going to come with me, and
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.380]   you're going to fish for men, not fish."
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.020]   Peter follows Jesus, leaves everything behind, goes.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:10.180]   John closes out the book of the Bible, showing us this story of Jesus welcoming even the
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.320]   disgraced, which is what Peter was and what Peter was feeling.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.380]   Why do I say that?
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.360]   Why would you go back to your old way of living and old fishing?
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.280]   Peter, Jesus said, "You're the guy I'm going to build the entire church movement on.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.960]   You're the guy that for the next however many thousands of years until I return, people
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.360]   are going to name their kids after.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.360]   You're going to be the rock on which this thing is built.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.480]   Your decoration of faith, that's what the name even Peter means, rock.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.160]   You're the guy who is going to lead the first century church.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   That's who you are, Peter."
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:49.980]   And Peter, after denying Jesus three times, he goes back to fishing.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:56.340]   He sees himself as, and what in some ways he was behaviorally, "I failed Jesus."
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.500]   I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:07.180]   In Jesus' worst moment of need, Peter, who's the best friend, the leader of the disciples,
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.900]   Jesus gets arrested that night.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.300]   Hours before, he was eating a meal with Jesus and Jesus was like, "You know, Peter, everybody
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.060]   here is going to abandon me."
[00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:18.220]   And Peter goes, "They may abandon you.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.840]   I will never abandon you.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.940]   Everybody else, they may abandon, but I'll die before I abandon you.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.380]   I will never disown you."
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:31.740]   And Jesus says, "Before the rooster crows three times, you're going to deny me three
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.740]   times tonight."
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:41.060]   And Peter, we're told, after Jesus is arrested later in the garden when Jesus was praying,
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.300]   these soldiers come up and they take Jesus and they take him to a trial, kind of this
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.220]   courtyard outside.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.740]   And Peter follows at a distance.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.540]   He's afraid if they just arrested Jesus, they may arrest me.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.940]   He begins to watch the trial taking place and there's this fire, we're told, by the
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.940]   courtyard.
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:57.940]   This is in John 18.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.940]   It's really in all of the gospels.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.660]   And he goes over to the fireplace and there's people gathered around him.
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:06.380]   He just begins to warm his hands on what they say is like a charcoal fire.
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.020]   And as he's warming his hands, you can see the trial happening.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.980]   And somebody goes, "Wait a second.
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:13.980]   You're with Jesus.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.340]   You were one of his followers, aren't you?"
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.660]   And he says, "No, no, I've never heard the guy.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.620]   No, you got me mistaken for somebody else."
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.700]   And then a middle school girl comes up.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.980]   The girl was like 12 years old and she's like, "Hey, you were with Jesus that one day, weren't
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.980]   you?"
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.980]   And he says, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.980]   Wrong guy.
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.980]   You're looking for John."
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.260]   He totally just denies it.
[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:40.140]   And then a third person comes up and we're told that he begins to yell out curses.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.020]   "I'm not with this man."
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.700]   Likely curses on Jesus.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.540]   And in that moment, the rooster crowed.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.060]   And we're told that Jesus looked like he looked across the courtyard and he saw him.
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.780]   And Peter went out and he just wept and wept.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.860]   There's no mention of Peter coming to see Jesus crucified.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:05.460]   He went and then his shame and guilt ran from his savior.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.980]   And so when he goes fishing, it's clearly a declaration of, "Man, God has done with
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.460]   me.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.460]   He chose me and he told me that I would do all these things and I abandoned him.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.820]   I'm the biggest failure of all the disciples," which he was.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.700]   And Jesus shows up as the men are out there fishing.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.340]   This is in the chapter.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.540]   And he stands on the shore that morning.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.500]   He says, "Hey, guys, did you catch any fish?"
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.340]   And he yells out to the disciples in the boat.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.340]   They can't tell that it's Jesus.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.460]   And he says, "Hey, throw the net on the other side."
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.380]   And they throw the net on the other side and it says they catch so many fish that they
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.740]   can't even pull it into the boat.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.860]   They just got to drag it all the way to shore.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.180]   And they get to the shore and they realize it's Jesus.
[00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.700]   And this is what happens next.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:56.980]   When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals with fish on it and some bread.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.260]   And Jesus had made them breakfast.
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.260]   And they sit down and we're told that they begin to eat and they're hanging out and having
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.580]   breakfast.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.900]   And then Jesus and Peter have a conversation.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:15.180]   When they'd finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John," which is
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.980]   like your mom using your full name.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.980]   You know it's a serious conversation.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.300]   It's like David, James, Marvin, what are you doing?
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   It's essentially what's going on.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.060]   "Do you love me more than these?"
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.060]   People...
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.220]   There's speculation on, is he talking about the other disciples or the fish?
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.420]   My guess is the other disciples because I feel like he would be like, "You mean the
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.420]   fish?
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.420]   Of course."
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.900]   But either way, his answer is going to be the same.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.580]   "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.260]   And he said, "Feed my lambs."
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.260]   Again, Jesus said, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.460]   And he answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.140]   And Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:02.500]   The third time he said to him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.540]   And Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him a third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.420]   And he said, "Lord, you know all things.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.420]   You know that I love you."
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.360]   And he said, "Feed my sheep."
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   What is Jesus doing?
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.820]   Is he trying to rub something in?
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:27.900]   Jesus is recreating and redefining the future that Peter will have.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.500]   He's recreating the moment of Peter's betrayal.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.340]   "What do I mean?"
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.580]   They're sitting around a charcoal fire.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.340]   Do you know the only other time in the entire New Testament that the word charcoal fire
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.260]   is used?
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:45.140]   Two chapters earlier, when Peter is sitting around a charcoal fire where he denies three
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.940]   times Jesus.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:53.100]   Now he's sitting around a charcoal fire two chapters later where three times he says,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.660]   "Jesus, I love you.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.660]   I love you.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.660]   I love you."
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:00.420]   Jesus is communicating to Peter, "Despite the fact that you abandoned me, despite the
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.260]   fact that you failed me, despite the fact that you do not deserve to be used by me,
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.700]   I want you to feed my sheep.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   I want to use you."
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.820]   What does that even mean, "Feed my sheep"?
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.500]   Jesus uses the metaphor for the people or the flock of God as his sheep.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.820]   "I want you to lead the church, Peter.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.820]   You may think I'm done with you.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.820]   You get off the boat.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.820]   You're not fishing for fish.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:20.820]   You're fishing for men.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.500]   I'm not done with you.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.760]   I welcome those who are a disgrace.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.700]   I welcome those who do not deserve to be used by me.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.340]   That's the only type of people that I use."
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.300]   God every time there's a movement of God any place, anywhere, anytime, it is God working
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   in spite of people.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:42.580]   No matter how faithful someone is, no matter how much they try and they are devoted to
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.180]   Jesus, it is always working in spite of people.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.220]   He says, "Peter, this wasn't about you.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.980]   You think that I'm done with you?
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   I want you to build my church.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.660]   I want you to feed my sheep.
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:58.180]   I'm a God who welcomes the disgraced.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.780]   When you feel shame and guilt, like Peter, you have a choice.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:09.660]   I will either let that drive me towards Jesus and the fact that, yes, I failed.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.660]   I'm a sinner.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.060]   That's why I need a Savior.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.540]   I don't want to wallow in that."
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.580]   The Bible says that you reap what you sow, so it doesn't mean there won't be consequences
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.300]   for decisions that you make, but if you're wallowing in shame and guilt, you need to
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.940]   know God is not done with you.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.500]   He calls on you and calls to you just like he called towards Peter.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.260]   "I'm not done with you.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.260]   I have a plan for your life.
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.500]   I have a purpose for your life."
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.380]   It's as though Peter puts on the glasses and he sees maybe for the first time.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.420]   Scholars think that this was the moment everything changed for Peter, but he understood that
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:43.380]   God wasn't a God who like, "Our relationship is defined by how good you do.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.340]   And if you mess up one too many times, I'm done."
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:52.740]   But the God who's there, he doesn't work like that.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:42:01.940]   In working in ministry, I know that the power of shame and guilt can be overwhelming.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.820]   I am not the husband that I want to be.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.980]   I'm not the father that I want to be.
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.580]   I've said before that I just went through region to work on anger and control and pride
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   and lust.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.740]   Anytime that I fail, I have the choice.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:20.540]   I'm either going to allow the fact that, "Yes."
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.580]   Just because I'm in ministry doesn't mean I can't be a Christian, which is someone who
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.740]   says, "God, I need you to help.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.740]   I need to take ground.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.060]   I'm going to bring in God's people and just say, 'This is where I'm not being everything
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.140]   that I want to be, everything God calls me to be.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.500]   And God, will you please take more ground in my heart?
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.980]   Will you help me?
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:43.340]   Because there's still a war and there's still sin inside of me."
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.460]   If that shame and guilt is telling you right now that you need to run, the God who's there
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:53.780]   wouldn't love you, couldn't do anything about it, or your carrying is too heavy, you can't
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.340]   tell anybody, that is a lie.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:02.500]   God who's done with you, that is a lie.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.820]   And it is too heavy for you to hold.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.660]   And the God who's there is saying, "I'm not done with you, Peter.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.620]   And I'm not done with you.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.620]   I love you.
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:16.940]   And I will use you and your story, no matter how broken and dysfunctional it is, to be
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.820]   a testimony to the world around you.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:26.060]   And you'll experience purpose and life and meaning and hope, or you can allow it to drive
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.060]   you to go fishing."
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:35.900]   Whether that's towards the arms of a relationship you shouldn't be in, back to pornography,
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.620]   back to alcohol, or back to who knows?
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:46.740]   But the God who's there is not done, and he welcomes the disgraced and meets them with
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.260]   grace.
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.540]   Like I said, there were three Ds, the desperate, the doubting, and the disgraced.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.980]   The truth is, as Christians, we live in a world where there's another three D, like
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.140]   I said.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.260]   It's that we live in lens.
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.000]   We are invited as a Christian, if you're a follower of Jesus, to live a life that sees
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.700]   everything in life through another three D lens.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   What do I mean?
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.700]   A third day lens.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   What is the third day?
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.300]   The third day was the day that Jesus rose from the grave.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.380]   He was crucified on day one, day two, and then day three, he rose from the grave.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.460]   And now when that happened, everything changed.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:24.640]   If that happened, even if you're not a Christian, you need to know this is what we believe.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   Everything changed.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.780]   When Jesus rose from the grave, everything in our world that was broken has begun to
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.660]   start working backwards, and God gave the seal and the promise that one day I'm going
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.620]   to heal everything.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.540]   And you now, if you're a Christian, the lens that we see the world through, the way that
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.700]   we see the brokenness of pain and life and the way that we look through the lens in this
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.900]   world is through the lens of the resurrection.
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:49.340]   Jesus rose from the dead, and if that's true, that puts everything in perspective.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.060]   Every pain that you feel all of a sudden because of Jesus rising for the grave and conquering
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.540]   death, you know that that pain is going away.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.940]   It's got an expiration date.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.280]   It will not be a part of the world to come.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.800]   Every disappointment you face, every circumstance where you're like, just wish I was married
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.260]   by now.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:08.300]   All of a sudden it pales in comparison because it's put into perspective.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.620]   The fact that this life is a vapor, I'm going to be with God forever and ever and ever.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.340]   All the questions that I ask all of a sudden get shrunk down.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.620]   Like, you know, where am I supposed to work?
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.620]   Where am I supposed to marry?
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.900]   And what am I supposed to do with my life?
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.740]   All of those in light of the resurrection, if it's true, if Jesus came back alive and
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.260]   everything that he said is true, and if you believe in him and trust in him, you're going
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.260]   to live forever and rise again.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.660]   All of those questions, it's not that they go away, they get dismissed.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:34.460]   They just shrink in comparison to the ultimate question.
[00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.880]   All of life.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.140]   It's like goes into focus and you see it and it goes from fuzzy to.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.140]   I can see it all through the 3D lens, the third day lens, the resurrection lens, every
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.900]   message, you know, it's crazy.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.420]   I'm laying in the plane, every message in the new Testament, you know what it has, you
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.420]   know what they talk about?
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   What do I mean by that?
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.540]   Like every time there's a sermon or Peter and Paul, they go around and they're like,
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.540]   Hey, you got to tell you this message.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.260]   Do you know what they don't say?
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.220]   Hey, you should turn the other cheek.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:05.380]   And if they, um, you know, go a mile, if they got a mile, let me tell you this parable is
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.380]   a great one.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.180]   Uh, they don't have any of that.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.500]   They say, I saw a man die and we buried him in the ground.
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.340]   And then three days later he came back alive.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.060]   And so you can do whatever you want to me and you could tell me, I can't believe that.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.560]   Look, dude, I saw a dead guy.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.620]   He went into the ground and he came back alive.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.100]   Every message in the new Testament, every sermon, check it.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:25.900]   Every one of them doesn't have at the epicenter.
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.540]   If somebody wants you to go a mile, go to, it says, Jesus rose from the grave.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.920]   And if that's true, everything has changed.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   Everything has changed.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:40.380]   And Peter saw in a moment, it was true and everything is changing your life, your world.
[00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.780]   If you see it and you as a Christian are called to see it, and I'm called to see it through
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.500]   the lens of the resurrection of Jesus, he came alive.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   And you know what that means?
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.500]   You will too.
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.700]   So now we're going to baptize like a handful of different people, 15, some people, and
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.220]   they've all said, Jesus is alive.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   He rose from the grave.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.220]   I believe it.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.220]   He changed the calendar.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.860]   He changed the world and he changed my world and I believe it and I've experienced it.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.540]   And if that's true, and that's the lens we get to see life through, even death comes
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.820]   into focus.
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:13.020]   The worst scenarios in life you can see with the perspective.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:18.420]   But it's the only one that gives any hope and aligns anything with or any ability to
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:24.540]   see in the midst of the darkest things, a deeper, greater reality that our God is alive.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.780]   He is King.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.780]   He's good.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.780]   He's made a way.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.140]   Let me pray.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:50.300]   Father, I thank you that you don't give up on those who are disgrace.
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:55.580]   You allow us to wrestle with doubts and you don't shun us or move away from us.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:05.180]   You move towards us in a way that is almost incomprehensible.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.580]   You move towards the desperate.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.860]   And so I pray right now, God, for every person in this room who has never had a moment where
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.140]   they trusted you are the one.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.940]   You're the one that their soul was made for.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.060]   You're the one who made their soul.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.860]   You're the one who died in their place.
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.300]   You're the one who offers and promises eternal life that they will just accept it by faith
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.700]   and receive the free gift.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:31.620]   You died and you paid for their sin, and then you rose from the grave.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.340]   And it was like the payment, the check cleared.
[00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.820]   I pray tonight that you would call and whisper their name right now all over the room, that
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.380]   you would be calling people by name.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.820]   That's what you do.
[00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:49.100]   And their life would be changed and they would begin to walk as though they were raised to
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.060]   walk in newness of life.
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:57.180]   Thank you, God, that you don't give up on disgraces and broken sinners like me.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:01.860]   And that you call us to walk in that newness of life with other people around us.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.260]   We worship you now in song.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:08.940]   Would you be honored with the words that we sing and just the way that we respond to your
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.940]   word?
