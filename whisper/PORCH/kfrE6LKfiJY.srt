1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:21,300
 - All right, let's go!

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,700
 2020 is here!

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,020
 (audience cheering)

5
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,900
 Man, we could not be more excited.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,380
 So welcome everybody that is here tonight.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,720
 And also, let me do something as we start off 2020

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,660
 that we've never done before.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,700
 Let me welcome every Porch Live location,

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,340
 whether you in Porch North, up in Frisco and Plano,

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,500
 in Fort Worth, in Fayetteville,

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,140
 outside of Philly and Southampton,

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,420
 Cincinnati Porch, Cedar Rapids, Iowa,

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,900
 Missouri City, Sweetwater, Texas, Houston, Texas, Phoenix,

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,700
 Porch Live Midhill, North Carolina,

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,460
 Porch Nashville, Porch of the Woodlands,

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,460
 Porch El Paso, Porch Tulsa, Porch Austin,

18
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,940
 and Porch Boise, Idaho, for the very first night.

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,340
 (audience cheering)

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,080
 In case you were wondering,

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,460
 we love getting to welcome all you guys.

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,700
 We can't always do that 'cause there's a lot of 'em.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,680
 So all that to say, welcome friends.

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,260
 Tonight we are starting this series, Roaring 20s.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,780
 We are back in the 20s, which is pretty crazy

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,960
 because, man, it has been a minute since we were here,

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,700
 but we're back again.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,520
 And it's crazy to think of what actually,

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,980
 just how our world has changed

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,540
 since we were in the 20s, the 1920s.

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,020
 I don't know what you know about the 20s

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,620
 or how much history you're familiar with,

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,020
 but the 20s were a time where, iconically,

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,060
 images like this were really famous

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,220
 of what was known as the flappers.

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,580
 Apparently this was really scandalous

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,860
 because girls at that time,

38
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,140
 it's crazy how much the world was changed,

39
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,500
 scandalous because girls wore dresses

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,220
 that came up to their knees.

41
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,960
 And boys were not supposed to mess with girls.

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,140
 Mama told you not to mess with girls

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,380
 who had dresses that went to their knees.

44
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,380
 In addition to that, there was something taking place.

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,060
 I believe called, yep, next one, prohibition.

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,300
 We actually outlawed alcohol for a decade,

47
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,820
 which just led to bootlegging

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,740
 and the underground crime unit.

49
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,340
 Additionally, Babe Ruth was on the scene.

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,380
 If you remember him, iconically remembered

51
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,500
 because of Sandlot, great Bambino was around.

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
 Women's right to vote happened.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,340
 There we go.

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,120
 Better late than never.

55
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,760
 It's crazy that the country sustained,

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,100
 everyone knows women are smarter than men,

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,140
 generally speaking, that you made it that many years

58
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,920
 without women speaking in directly.

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,820
 It's a thing in and of itself.

60
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,380
 In addition to that, Amelia Earhart, yes, queen.

61
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,520
 This girl flew,

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,860
 was the very first aviation lady to pioneer that.

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,380
 Henry Ford transformed the world

64
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,240
 with the Ford 4AT, Ford T model,

65
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,380
 and 24 million cars burst onto the scene.

66
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,020
 It was roaring because so many technological advancements

67
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,180
 were happening, electricity quadrupled,

68
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,400
 people were getting access to running water.

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,060
 They had a car, the game was changing,

70
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,000
 and it was roaring.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,420
 In addition to that, little known fact,

72
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,780
 there was also something called sliced bread

73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,420
 that got invented in the 1920s.

74
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,020
 And so the expression,

75
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,860
 it's the greatest thing since sliced bread.

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,280
 Now you know, oh, they mean since the 1920s,

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,080
 but the roaring '20s just had all types of things

78
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,300
 that marked that generation.

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,460
 And as we look towards 2020s,

80
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,480
 you can't help but wonder,

81
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,700
 what is history gonna record about the 2020s

82
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,540
 that's gonna be in front of us

83
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,580
 when people look back in a decade?

84
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,140
 And truth is, none of us know.

85
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,540
 We can't know, won't know.

86
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,020
 We'll get to hopefully live through it

87
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
 unless Jesus comes back.

88
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,700
 But what you can know is what your 2020s are gonna hold,

89
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,740
 not entirely, but largely,

90
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
 because you're gonna play a role,

91
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,100
 and I play a role in shaping my 2020s,

92
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,380
 the years 2020 to 2030.

93
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,180
 If we're alive, if you're alive,

94
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,620
 you will play a direct role

95
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,940
 not in controlling everything your 20s are gonna hold,

96
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,460
 but more than anyone else,

97
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,520
 you are going to shape, more than anyone alive,

98
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,020
 what your 20s are gonna hold.

99
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,100
 This is a decade that will define your life.

100
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,580
 We call it the series, The Decade of Decisions,

101
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,820
 because this is a decade.

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,420
 It's sobering and crazy and like, oh my gosh,

103
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,980
 as that feels that this, more than any other decade,

104
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,300
 will likely determine who you're gonna be,

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,820
 the direction of your life, the story you will have.

106
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,360
 Think about that.

107
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
 Why do I say that?

108
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,740
 You know, even secular psychologists say

109
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,140
 that 80% of the major decisions that we make in life

110
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,060
 are made by the age 35.

111
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,860
 Between the ages of 20 to 35, we make decisions.

112
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,500
 75% of you will, by the age of 35, be married.

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,380
 That's not a guarantee, and I hate to say it.

114
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,180
 This section right here is the 25% that won't be married.

115
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,340
 Everybody else, just that was not the right,

116
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,340
 and that's not at all true, but point being,

117
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,200
 75, think about that.

118
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,900
 That means the vast majority, other than, you know, 25%,

119
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,860
 and then the, more than 80 will be married by 40.

120
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,180
 This decade is also the time where we establish careers

121
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,080
 or the direction of kind of your career life.

122
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,340
 They even say that the majority

123
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,580
 of your lifetime wage earnings will be established

124
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,820
 in your 20s and early 30s.

125
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,540
 You develop your personality,

126
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,080
 and it changes more than any other time

127
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,920
 in your 20s.

128
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,180
 There's not a single decade that is more significant

129
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,420
 to the direction and story of your life

130
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,180
 than the one that you're living in right now.

131
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,820
 Think about that.

132
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,820
 And the good news is, the God who's there loves you,

133
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,860
 is crazy about you.

134
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,800
 He hasn't left you to navigate it on your own

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,420
 or me to navigate it on my own,

136
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,460
 and he wants you to have 20s that roar

137
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,300
 in every way you could imagine

138
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,460
 or every way in your heart of hearts you want them to.

139
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,260
 He wants more for you than you even want for yourself,

140
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,020
 and he's given us instructions in his word

141
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,960
 to lead you to life in these 20s,

142
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
 and he's invited you.

143
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,580
 Don't run your own offense in these decades.

144
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,920
 Don't leave it in your own hands.

145
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
 Don't leave it in the hands of culture

146
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,080
 of the world around you.

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,480
 I'm a loving father who wants to lead you

148
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,040
 in the direction of the life you couldn't

149
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,560
 hardly even dream of

150
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,740
 and the story that you're gonna tell someday.

151
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,120
 And so tonight, we're gonna kick off

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,680
 what'll be the first really six or seven weeks

153
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
 in this series where we wanna cover,

154
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,880
 here's like our goal and hope for this series,

155
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
 is that in the next handful of weeks,

156
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,560
 we wanna cover the biggest issues

157
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,920
 that you gotta have a death grip,

158
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,180
 you've gotta get this issue right

159
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,460
 if you're gonna have 20s that roar

160
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,580
 in every way you want 'em to and God wants 'em to.

161
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,740
 So we're gonna go through dating,

162
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,120
 we're gonna go through finances,

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,020
 we're gonna go through career,

164
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,660
 we're gonna go through everything that we think

165
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,500
 as we just prayed through,

166
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,000
 like these are some of the biggest issues

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,620
 you've gotta get right in this season of life

168
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,340
 that are at the heart of really the young adult experience

169
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,260
 and so many decisions that you and I will be making

170
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,240
 over the next 10 to 15 years.

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,620
 Tonight, I just wanna start us off

172
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,220
 and really frame up the series

173
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,220
 and explore decision-making in your 20s.

174
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,860
 The Bible has, you may not realize this,

175
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,780
 lots and lots to say about wise decision-making.

176
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,180
 The entire book of Proverbs is all about decision-making.

177
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,020
 There's a passage tonight,

178
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,580
 we're gonna look at the Apostle Paul teaches on,

179
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,860
 Jesus teaches on, like how to make sure you are not a fool

180
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,420
 who wastes away, who brings like pain

181
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,900
 and messes up your life.

182
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,540
 You only get one 20s, you only get one life

183
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,780
 and the God who's there loves you enough

184
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,660
 to give you clear instruction and me clear instruction

185
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,500
 on how to best use it.

186
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,980
 We're gonna kick off by looking at decision-making

187
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,820
 in our 20s.

188
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,860
 What does it look like to make decisions

189
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,820
 in line with God's word and in line with producing

190
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,820
 a 20s, 2020 to 2030 that roars in every way we want it to.

191
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,900
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open

192
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,700
 to Galatians chapter six, Galatians chapter six

193
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,020
 and we will kick off and read a few verses

194
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,220
 and I'll break it up as we go through there.

195
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,740
 Galatians is a book written by the apostle

196
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,340
 formerly known as Saul who became Paul,

197
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,060
 who spent half his life trying to stomp out Christianity,

198
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,740
 meets Jesus and then devotes the rest of his life

199
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,940
 to spreading the message of Christ and the gospel

200
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,340
 all around the world.

201
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,300
 He writes about one third of the New Testament

202
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,700
 and this is one of the letters that he wrote

203
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,180
 to the church in Galatia and he's laid out,

204
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,020
 really he spends several different chapters

205
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,940
 talking about the gospel and how it lives out

206
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,980
 the good news of Jesus dying on the cross in your place,

207
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,420
 how you can have new life and then he transitions

208
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,620
 and gives some sobering reminders

209
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,980
 that despite the fact that God has already made the way,

210
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,580
 no matter what you do, if you have trust in Christ,

211
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,060
 you have eternal life forever.

212
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,460
 In a moment, by faith, you trust Jesus on the cross,

213
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,500
 paid for everything you've ever done

214
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,740
 and you trust in his death, his burial

215
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,820
 and his resurrection that he defeated death,

216
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,620
 he paid for your sin, you're a believer.

217
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,060
 But that doesn't mean that now any way

218
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,540
 that you live in this life is gonna be void of consequences.

219
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,340
 So he says this, starting in verse seven of chapter six.

220
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,440
 Do not be deceived, Paul says.

221
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,820
 God cannot be mocked.

222
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,900
 A man will reap what he sows.

223
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,980
 He uses an agricultural expression

224
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,020
 and he basically says, hey, God has put into the universe

225
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,140
 or into our world certain laws or certain principles

226
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,980
 that if you break those principles,

227
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,500
 if you live in the opposite direction

228
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,240
 of what God's law teaches,

229
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,300
 you are going to experience consequences for it.

230
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,680
 He introduces a principle that,

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,580
 hey, you're going to reap what you sow.

232
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,260
 Like, hey, you sow apple seeds,

233
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,500
 you're gonna reap an apple tree.

234
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,900
 Sow orange seeds, you're not gonna reap a banana tree.

235
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,220
 Whatever you put in, you're gonna end up eventually,

236
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,740
 whatever you plant in the ground,

237
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,460
 whatever you seeds are sown into your life

238
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,980
 are going to produce fruit.

239
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,820
 Those are going to be a part of your life.

240
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,740
 So be careful what you sow 'cause God is not mocked.

241
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,820
 He gives us, the first idea that I wanna highlight

242
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,720
 is just the principle of decision making.

243
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,440
 Like, there's a principle that the decisions you make,

244
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,860
 every time you're making a decision,

245
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,200
 daily, small, big, you are sowing seeds into your life

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,260
 that eventually are gonna show back up,

247
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,080
 that you're gonna harvest,

248
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
 you're gonna produce fruit either positively or negatively.

249
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,620
 And it's a principle, it's a principle.

250
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,740
 What I mean and why is that important?

251
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,600
 Because a principle, as it's been said,

252
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,980
 is not something that you choose to apply.

253
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,980
 Like, hey, if you reap and if you choose, you can sow.

254
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,740
 No, a principle applies itself to you.

255
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,540
 The principle and law of gravity

256
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,580
 is not something you choose to apply.

257
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,820
 Like, if I decide, I'm not gonna apply gravity

258
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,520
 and I step off of this, it's gonna apply itself to me.

259
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,000
 And so it's not a question of whether or not

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,460
 this is something you should do,

261
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,860
 it is something that will happen to you.

262
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,420
 What you reap, the decisions you make today

263
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,220
 in your dating relationships, financial relationships,

264
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,780
 in your career, in your character,

265
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,540
 in the people you're around,

266
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,220
 all of those decisions are eventually

267
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,940
 gonna show themselves back up inside of your life.

268
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,520
 So the question is, what are you planting?

269
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,500
 What are the things that you are putting into your life,

270
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,440
 the decisions, whether you're consciously making them or not

271
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,920
 that are going to direct the course of your life?

272
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,140
 You are building a life.

273
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,940
 The question is whether or not you are intentional

274
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,460
 about the things that you're building around.

275
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,300
 What do I mean?

276
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,580
 Like, I'll use an illustration.

277
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,420
 Over the break, we went to a place called Build-A-Bear.

278
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,860
 Anybody ever heard of Build-A-Bear?

279
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,560
 My four-year-old son, it was his birthday, birthday month.

280
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,260
 We were told that if you go into Build-A-Bear,

281
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,860
 for whatever age you are,

282
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
 that's the price you pay during your birthday month.

283
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,620
 So he was turning four, he was like,

284
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,740
 "Oh, we're gonna get a $4 bear, we're winning.

285
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,780
 "This is awesome."

286
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,160
 And we go in there and go to the store,

287
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,460
 and my first experience with Build-A-Bear,

288
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,120
 so didn't know exactly what I was going into,

289
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,400
 but it's like, "Dude, four bucks, this is such a win."

290
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,920
 And then we got into Build-A-Bear.

291
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,860
 And what they don't tell you is that,

292
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,960
 yeah, they'll give you like this empty blank bear,

293
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,520
 but anything else that you want to build into the bear

294
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,240
 is an additional price.

295
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,700
 And it is not a cheap price.

296
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,860
 So they're over there charging like $18

297
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,840
 for some shoes that a bear wears,

298
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,660
 and some underwear and pants and a shirt.

299
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,180
 And I'm like trying to like get out of there like,

300
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,880
 "No, we'll just do the four."

301
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,660
 And that people look at you like,

302
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,700
 "What, do you not love your children?

303
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,540
 "Is that what this is?"

304
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,000
 And you're like, "All right, just give him the pants.

305
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,900
 "Give him the pants already, we'll pay for the pants."

306
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,860
 And he begins to go through,

307
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,740
 and I let him like, we let him build whatever he wanted.

308
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,020
 So he gets the Spider-Man stuff in there,

309
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,980
 and he begins to add on,

310
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,840
 and each thing that he added came with a cost.

311
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,360
 And as his dad, I know that the things that he's adding,

312
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,060
 I'm like, "I don't know that you're gonna want that."

313
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,940
 Like he was like, "I want it to smell like strawberries."

314
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,620
 And I'm like, "Dude, that is really strong strawberry smell.

315
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,020
 "Are you sure?

316
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,700
 "You're gonna be smelling that forever, forever."

317
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,700
 And if, man, Sandlot has got me thrown off right now.

318
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,460
 And then it came to the music,

319
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,300
 and they put like a thing that makes music inside of it

320
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,580
 for an additional $12.

321
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,660
 And he was like, "Yeah."

322
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,020
 They let him go through and pick the songs,

323
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,500
 and he picks "12 Days of Christmas."

324
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
 And I was like, "Man, I love that.

325
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,540
 "I don't know if you're gonna want '12 Days of Christmas'

326
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,460
 "for the rest of the rest, like in June.

327
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,180
 "We're still playing '12 Days of Christmas'

328
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,260
 "in my house right now."

329
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,780
 And I knew this is, you like it now, it cost us $12.

330
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,500
 I don't think you're gonna like it in six months,

331
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,100
 and it's a $50 bear.

332
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,420
 So, but he just went through,

333
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,500
 and everything he added had a cost with it.

334
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,920
 And some, as his dad, I look on and go,

335
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,700
 "Man, I don't know that you're gonna like that right now."

336
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,820
 And other things, you know,

337
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,420
 "I think you're probably still gonna like

338
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,180
 "that Spider-Man shirt in six months.

339
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,300
 "What does that have to do with you?

340
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,560
 "You are building a life.

341
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,940
 "This decade, you are deciding, and you are creating,

342
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,980
 "and you are becoming the spouse you're gonna be.

343
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,660
 "Today, and the decisions that you made

344
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,020
 "play a role in shaping the type of husband,

345
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,400
 "type of father, the type of career path,

346
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,180
 "like the person you are becoming, you are building it.

347
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,060
 "And every decision that you make comes with a cost."

348
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,620
 It's not a question of whether it's like,

349
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,900
 "Hey, is it free or is it not?"

350
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,260
 Like, no, every decision that you make comes at a cost.

351
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,580
 What do I mean?

352
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,240
 Like the decision that, "Hey, I'm gonna give my 20s

353
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,880
 "to just kind of live in for the weekend

354
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,940
 "and party in every Thursday,

355
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,040
 "essentially through Saturday night,

356
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,880
 "and then I'll be there at church,

357
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,160
 "but I'm gonna live towards that and give it away

358
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,600
 "and basically numb my 20s away

359
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,200
 "because I'm so depressed with the rest of my work,

360
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,780
 "wreath, and life."

361
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,740
 It's gonna come at a cost

362
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,980
 of experiencing your purpose in this decade.

363
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,020
 You're gonna stay in a dating relationship,

364
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,300
 and it's gonna come at a cost.

365
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,700
 That's something you're building into your life.

366
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,920
 You're saying, "I'm gonna put that on my bear."

367
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,460
 And it's a dysfunctional dating relationship.

368
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,340
 Some of you are in them right now.

369
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,180
 And you're staying in that,

370
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,340
 and you're continuing to stay with, you know,

371
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,860
 Mr. Wrong or Mrs. Wrong,

372
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,320
 and it is gonna prevent you from getting healthy

373
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,940
 because there's something unhealthy about you

374
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,580
 that you even keep going back to them.

375
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,500
 So you're not gonna get healthy,

376
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,340
 and you're not gonna end up finding someone

377
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,100
 that's the type of person God describes.

378
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,740
 So while staying with them is something you want

379
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,620
 in your life, it's coming at a cost to you.

380
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,540
 The flip side is true if you wanna follow God's word,

381
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,460
 if you wanna do what he said,

382
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,100
 like some of you, you've made the decision that,

383
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,820
 "Hey, this year I wanna change my playmates

384
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,740
 "and my playgrounds," or, "I've been trying to do that

385
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,840
 "'cause I just have negative influences around me

386
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,000
 "and people who keep calling me,

387
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,700
 "and I keep getting pulled down by them."

388
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,140
 And it's gonna come at a cost.

389
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,700
 If you wanna build into your life,

390
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,040
 "I want the right people in my life.

391
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,140
 "I want God's people in my life."

392
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,960
 It's gonna cost you.

393
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
 What do I mean?

394
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
 Like, it's gonna cost.

395
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,680
 There's gonna be Friday nights where you say,

396
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,540
 "No, I'm not going to the bar again."

397
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,680
 Some of you are gonna say, "Hey, I want to get healthy.

398
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,020
 "I don't wanna have just, I keep having

399
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,840
 "one messed up relationship after the next.

400
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,640
 "I'm beginning to think the common denominator is me.

401
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,160
 "I need to get healthy.

402
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,100
 "And I think I just need to break up."

403
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,460
 And it's gonna come at the cost of breaking up.

404
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,780
 And let's be honest, like, dude, that sucks.

405
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,940
 But it's a decision that you'll look back on and go,

406
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,860
 "Man, I'm so glad, despite the cost and the pain,

407
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,300
 "and as hard as it was, that I decided to do

408
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,220
 "what God instructed me to do."

409
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,020
 And the flip side is also true.

410
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,300
 That there's things that, man, it may not cost you as much

411
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,380
 to continue to not follow what God says in the moment.

412
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,940
 But when you finish the end of your decade

413
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,940
 and all you have to show for it is a bunch of stories

414
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,540
 that you hardly remember 'cause you were intoxicated,

415
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,280
 it comes at an even greater cost in the long run.

416
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,700
 But the point is, you're gonna reap what you sow.

417
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,940
 Every decision that we're making is a part of sowing seeds.

418
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,520
 And Paul says, "Are you making sure you are planting

419
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,700
 "the right seeds in your life?"

420
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,260
 It's gonna cost you the way.

421
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,900
 Make sure that in the long run, you don't end up

422
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,220
 with a bear playing 12 Days of Christmas all year round.

423
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,800
 Or with a life that you end up at 30 going,

424
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,580
 "How did I even get here?"

425
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,600
 Or 35.

426
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,160
 Paul continues.

427
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,580
 Oh, there's another verse that is just so relevant to this

428
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,500
 that I'll read where the author of Proverbs highlights.

429
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,100
 You know what the definition of a fool biblically is?

430
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,780
 Like over and over, the fool used in Proverbs

431
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,060
 is somebody who knows it's wrong

432
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,300
 and I'm just gonna keep doing that anyways.

433
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,460
 Like, candidly, I'm using this

434
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,500
 and this is gonna sting a little bit

435
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,060
 'cause some of you have said this before.

436
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,220
 A fool is someone who thinks

437
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,580
 they're an exception to the rule.

438
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,900
 If you're like, "Yeah, I know.

439
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,120
 "That's pretty much the bad thing for everybody out there

440
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,920
 "and I really shouldn't be with someone like this."

441
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,400
 Or, "I really should stop smoking 'cause it kills you,

442
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,940
 "but my grandma lived to be 98."

443
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,760
 That, from the biblical perspective,

444
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,020
 who says, "I see danger coming, I don't care.

445
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,440
 "I'm not gonna live in light of that."

446
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,160
 Biblically speaking, is a fool.

447
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,700
 I don't see this relationship actually

448
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,460
 ever going anywhere that's healthy,

449
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,240
 but I just don't think I can leave.

450
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,900
 You're a fool.

451
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,260
 And as lovingly as I can say,

452
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,160
 that's just biblically the definition.

453
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,260
 Proverbs chapter 22, verse three says,

454
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,560
 "The wise see danger and they take refuge,

455
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,700
 "but the simple or the foolish keep going

456
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,000
 "and they suffer for it."

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,300
 A wise person sees danger coming,

458
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,040
 sees where this is going,

459
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,140
 and he begins to stop and make a change.

460
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,300
 Some of you tonight, the God of the universe

461
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,760
 who loves you so much,

462
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,960
 he has you here on a Tuesday night studying his word,

463
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,280
 who cares more and is more deeply invested

464
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,880
 and concerned with you thriving in your 20s,

465
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,960
 having an amazing marriage, having an amazing future.

466
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,760
 He cares way more about that than you do,

467
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,200
 for you than you do.

468
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,640
 He's got you here.

469
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
 And you may be in a place where you're going like,

470
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,700
 "I feel like I've been on the wrong track.

471
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,020
 "Like I lost the track.

472
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,860
 "I'm way off.

473
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,060
 "I've been running, I've been making decisions,

474
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,540
 "and I found myself in a substance addiction

475
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,280
 "or in a really unhealthy relationship.

476
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,020
 "I don't even know where to go.

477
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,380
 "I feel like I'm just lost

478
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,260
 "and I'm totally off the course that I wanna be at.

479
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,300
 "I don't even recognize myself anymore.

480
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,660
 "Things I never thought I would do, I'm doing."

481
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,240
 If you're in that place, you need to know

482
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,560
 your story's not done,

483
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,160
 and God has created and wants you to take a path back

484
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,560
 towards getting on the right track.

485
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,640
 You're not too far gone for him to take your story

486
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,260
 and make good out of it.

487
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,300
 But here's what you also need to know.

488
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,720
 There is no overnight fix.

489
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,800
 In other words, in that moment where we're like,

490
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,640
 "Hey, I'm lost right now.

491
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,560
 "I just don't know where to go.

492
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,180
 "And I just wish, like everything's falling apart

493
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,800
 "and I can't believe it, and she's pregnant,

494
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,600
 "or I can't believe the STD happened."

495
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,800
 Whatever the situation is, whatever your story is,

496
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,220
 or maybe it's just, "I can't believe

497
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,680
 "that I've just wandered so far from him."

498
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,040
 There is no overnight, and I'm back.

499
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,520
 But just like when I get lost in the car,

500
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,440
 you get lost in the car.

501
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,900
 Like I was in Cleveland a couple weeks ago for an event,

502
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,820
 and I was driving my own car,

503
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,240
 and I just don't know Cleveland.

504
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,880
 So I thought I was headed the right way,

505
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,580
 and then I realized, "I'm lost right now.

506
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,240
 "How do I, when I'm lost, get back on track?"

507
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,100
 I retrace, I go back to where I was, and I get on.

508
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,660
 There's no moment where I just blink,

509
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,640
 and I'm back on track.

510
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,420
 That's the same way with a Christian life.

511
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,560
 If you've been running, you need to know

512
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,600
 you're not too far gone, but the path

513
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,000
 is not just some overnight thing.

514
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,520
 You make a decision after decision after decision.

515
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
 The way you beat a pornography addiction

516
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,280
 is not by just, "Man, and then one moment,

517
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,100
 "he just prayed over me, and it was done."

518
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,240
 That's generally not the story.

519
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,140
 Generally the story is, "I've been sober one day,

520
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,780
 "I was sober two days, I was sober three days,

521
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,180
 "I've been sober four days, I've been sober five days,

522
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,440
 "I've got God's people around me,

523
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,440
 "and day by day, I am pursuing sowing seeds of purity."

524
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,320
 A dating relationship, whatever you have,

525
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,300
 if you start dating, you're like,

526
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,160
 "Dude, this one, I'm for sure, I've got a past,

527
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,000
 "I've sloughed around a little bit,

528
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,440
 "but this one, no way we're ever gonna do that."

529
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,080
 You need to know the way that that happens

530
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,480
 is by day after day pursuing purity.

531
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,700
 It won't happen because you're like,

532
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,120
 "You know what, we're in this to win it,

533
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,080
 "but I just find you so unattractive,

534
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,760
 "I have no temptation here."

535
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,040
 That's not how it works.

536
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,420
 You know that, right?

537
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,880
 Generally that's the problem.

538
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,440
 It happens one day after the next,

539
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,080
 that, "Hey, I'm committed to pursuing purity,

540
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,180
 "you committed to pursuing purity, we're gonna do this,

541
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,980
 "we're gonna fight, and we're gonna go,

542
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,960
 "because we're sowing seeds of where this relationship

543
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,320
 "is going and where our life is going."

544
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,560
 And the God who's there says,

545
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,860
 "Are you planting the right seeds in the ground?"

546
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,960
 He then gives us two directions or fields

547
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,560
 so to speak that he lays out that each of us is gonna sow

548
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,480
 where he says this, verse eight.

549
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,080
 "Whoever sows," which is again,

550
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,720
 just a word for planting seeds,

551
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,600
 "to please their flesh,

552
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,760
 "from the flesh will reap destruction."

553
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,600
 Let me stop.

554
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,360
 This is one of my least favorite biblical words, flesh.

555
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,040
 It's just a weird term that we don't really use

556
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,000
 and nobody's like, "She's just a fleshy girl."

557
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,480
 That typically is not, it would confuse people.

558
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
 Biblically, and other translations have this,

559
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,640
 the word flesh is just a word for sinful nature.

560
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,480
 What's the sin nature?

561
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,040
 So whoever sows or plants according

562
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,360
 to what their sinful nature thinks they should do

563
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,080
 is gonna reap destruction, it says.

564
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,520
 Sin nature is the thing inside of you

565
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,400
 that makes sin come naturally.

566
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,920
 It's a thing that says, "I wanna do what I want,

567
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,080
 "when I want, with who I want, whenever I want."

568
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
 That's the sin nature.

569
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,680
 And he says, "If you live by that,

570
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,900
 "if you let that govern your life,

571
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,300
 "it's gonna lead into destruction, self-destructive self."

572
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,120
 But if whoever sows or plants according

573
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,460
 to please the spirit, sorry,

574
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,440
 from the spirit will reap eternal life.

575
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,400
 That if you sow spiritual things,

576
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,880
 which is things according to God's word,

577
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,760
 those are the things that you plant in your life,

578
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,040
 that you are going to reap life.

579
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,720
 The second thing, in addition to the principle

580
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,160
 of our decision-making,

581
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,120
 which is that you're gonna reap what you sow,

582
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,720
 is the path of your decision-making.

583
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,620
 Every decision is putting you on a path

584
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,060
 in one direction or another.

585
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,020
 Paul says, "And if you sow according to sinful nature,

586
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,720
 "you are gonna grow eventually," not in a moment,

587
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,420
 "things that are destructive."

588
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,420
 Addictions, idiosyncrasies, toxic thinking,

589
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,940
 where you just can't get out of it.

590
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,360
 Anytime you begin to sow those things,

591
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,300
 it's gonna lead to fruit from those things.

592
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,860
 And the same thing, which is also positive,

593
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,260
 if you sow according to the spirit,

594
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,900
 there's gonna be a fruit that comes at a later time.

595
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,340
 That he says, "Hey, you can predict

596
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,660
 "based on the decisions that you're making in this season."

597
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,380
 It's so hard to believe, 'cause it's like,

598
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,960
 one day, really, is it really that big of a deal?

599
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,240
 Paul says, "It's not just one day.

600
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,680
 "When you take those days and you take the decisions

601
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,760
 "and you put 'em together,

602
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,940
 "you can predict who you're gonna be and where you're going,

603
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,680
 "what your life is going to look like eventually."

604
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,220
 It's interesting, 'cause we as a culture love

605
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,660
 to kinda connect the dots on where we're going

606
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,500
 or where we've been and who we are

607
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,860
 and what we hope to look like, hope to be like someday,

608
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,900
 and have this mixed relationship

609
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,180
 where we don't mind looking back

610
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,740
 and we love kinda looking forward.

611
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
 And you remember the 10-year challenge?

612
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,420
 Anybody participate in this?

613
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,380
 10-year challenge?

614
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
 No, really?

615
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,580
 Wow, you guys gotta get on social media.

616
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,500
 I need to get off or something.

617
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,980
 10-year challenge was this moment where people were like,

618
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,620
 "Hey, this is what I was 10 years ago."

619
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,840
 And so here, there's 10 years ago.

620
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,040
 This guy was like sunburned,

621
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,200
 leaving a Hollister shop or something.

622
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,760
 And this, you've come a long way.

623
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,880
 But we've all, we're,

624
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,260
 they just looked back on, this is where we've been.

625
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,200
 And then there was another way,

626
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,140
 what we did in the future,

627
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,720
 where everyone had this app where we took,

628
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,080
 basically, we allowed Russia to hack all of our stuff,

629
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,820
 and we were like, "Make me look old here.

630
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,640
 "I wanna see what the future,

631
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,600
 "if I age like fine wine, or what I'm gonna look like."

632
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,440
 And we put it up there.

633
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,680
 In fact, here's the, where I was like,

634
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,120
 I looked at this and was like,

635
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,700
 "I gotta start using lotion or something, face cream,

636
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,480
 "because I look like the guy off Castaway

637
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,400
 "looking for Wilson, or,

638
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,940
 "and this is not the future that I want someday,

639
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,040
 "or Santa Claus."

640
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,600
 And, take it down.

641
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,440
 Okay, good.

642
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,520
 And in that moment, you can look,

643
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,740
 and you're like, "Oh man, if this is true,

644
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,000
 "is this really the future in front of me?"

645
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,320
 And Paul would say, not in a picture way,

646
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,960
 or externally what you're gonna look like,

647
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,000
 but he would say,

648
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,780
 "I can tell you, if I was to spend time with you,

649
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,460
 "and be around you, and look at the direction of your life,

650
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
 "I can tell you where you're gonna be

651
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,220
 "in a year, in two years, in 10 years,

652
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,600
 "by the time 2020 ends, or the 20s end,

653
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,640
 "I can tell you who you are becoming,

654
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,060
 "and where this is headed inside of your life,

655
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,780
 "by the decisions that you make today.

656
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,480
 "They're a path, they're not a moment.

657
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,200
 "Each one of them is a part of a path

658
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,520
 "that is taking you somewhere.

659
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,680
 "Are you headed in the right direction?"

660
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,320
 Let me be just a little bit more explicit.

661
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,760
 Are you headed in the right direction

662
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,040
 as it relates to your dating relationships?

663
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,800
 Like some of you are thinking,

664
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,260
 like let's just be real.

665
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,960
 There's people of us, or some of us in the room

666
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,340
 that are like, "Hey, you know what?

667
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,760
 "I'm just kind of like dating casually right now,

668
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,720
 "it's not that big of a deal,

669
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,920
 "they're not the perfect person,

670
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,300
 "but I don't have to find the perfect person,

671
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,600
 "I'm just in my 20s."

672
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,880
 And you're kind of going through this casual dating phase,

673
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,120
 and you're a little dysfunctional,

674
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,280
 but you have in the back of your mind

675
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,680
 that you're like, "No, but someday,

676
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,080
 "I'd like to party now a little bit,

677
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,880
 "but I'm going to end up married

678
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,440
 "when the right time comes, probably like 30, maybe 31,

679
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,920
 "and I'm gonna find the right guy who loves Jesus,

680
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,120
 "and we're gonna settle down,

681
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,360
 "he's gonna look like Ryan Gosling,

682
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,320
 "he's gonna make me breakfast,

683
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,160
 "come in the morning and be like,

684
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,520
 "'Hey babe, how was your quiet time?'"

685
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,440
 And you think that's coming.

686
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,560
 And let me just be real, that's not coming.

687
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,520
 It's not.

688
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,600
 And what's more likely to happen

689
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,040
 is that you're gonna continue to dysfunctionally date

690
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,720
 and date and date,

691
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,240
 and find maybe your worth or identity

692
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,080
 in having a girlfriend or having a boyfriend

693
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,280
 or that relationship,

694
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,160
 and then 32 is gonna come around,

695
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
 and you're not gonna have some guy that loves Jesus

696
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,320
 because you don't love Jesus,

697
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,360
 and guys who love Jesus

698
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
 are interested in girls who love Jesus,

699
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,640
 and girls who love Jesus

700
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,840
 are interested in guys who love Jesus,

701
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,680
 and you don't love Jesus,

702
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,000
 and you haven't been loving Jesus.

703
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,120
 So you're gonna end up probably making a poor decision

704
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,160
 by marrying mediocre Matt,

705
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,080
 no offense, Matt,

706
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,200
 who is like, "He doesn't even love Christ.

707
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
 "I'm just gonna press, I'm just going right now.

708
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,120
 "He's gonna propose to you in a very unromantic way,

709
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,040
 "won't even have a ring,

710
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,080
 "hasn't talked to your dad,

711
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,240
 "but he's like, 'Hey, let's do this,'"

712
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,080
 and you'll be like,

713
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,240
 "Well, I guess he's the only option I got.

714
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,640
 "He's mediocre Matt, but that's cool,

715
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,120
 "and I don't want him to spend my life single,

716
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,600
 "and you're gonna marry him."

717
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,760
 And that's a tragedy.

718
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,200
 And I'm saying all that with a lighthearted, playful way,

719
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,240
 but it's all too real,

720
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
 and I've seen it too many times,

721
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,640
 that you just kind of,

722
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,400
 you assume someday I'll get serious about God,

723
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,520
 and that day is not coming,

724
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,920
 or someday, hey, I'll really get somebody

725
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,200
 who is the type of husband, or type of father,

726
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,460
 or type of mother that I wanna be,

727
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,500
 and that day's not coming,

728
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,360
 unless you become the type of person

729
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,200
 that type of person is gonna look for.

730
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,760
 Others of you, like, you're gonna get this right.

731
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,200
 Others of you, for sure, like, in the next 10 years,

732
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,160
 you're not gonna end up with that story.

733
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,040
 You're gonna end up with the story

734
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,360
 that like you go all in with Jesus,

735
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,400
 you start serving at a church,

736
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,840
 you're gonna meet a godly guy,

737
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,440
 and he's gonna see in you a godly girl,

738
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,120
 or you're gonna meet a godly girl,

739
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,480
 and she's gonna see in you a godly guy,

740
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,080
 and you guys are gonna go on a date,

741
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,480
 you're gonna get to spend time together,

742
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,460
 you're gonna end up pursuing purity together,

743
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,300
 you're gonna get married,

744
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,120
 you'll probably have a kid by the end of 2030s,

745
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,960
 or 2030.

746
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360
 It's true, like, that story is in this room.

747
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,760
 It's beautiful.

748
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,080
 And tragically, the other story

749
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,160
 is that some of you guys are gonna get married

750
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,380
 and divorced by 2030.

751
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,160
 But you don't have to.

752
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,880
 And the decision to do so is in your hands right now.

753
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,140
 And as I prepared this message,

754
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,720
 my heart could not be more broken and pleading with you.

755
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,400
 These are the days and years to decide who you're gonna be,

756
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,240
 because who you're gonna be

757
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,400
 will define who you're gonna marry,

758
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
 where you're gonna work,

759
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,880
 and the person and the future and story you will tell

760
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,480
 for the rest of your life.

761
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,400
 Are you writing the story that you wanna look back on?

762
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,560
 Others of you, as it relates to,

763
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,880
 you know, the path that you're headed on

764
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,160
 as it relates to your financial scenario.

765
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,360
 You're in debt, and you're like,

766
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,840
 I don't really, you know, it doesn't really matter,

767
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,120
 I'll deal with it someday.

768
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,400
 And you're just adding on to it.

769
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,480
 You're like, yeah, car payment, that's a good idea.

770
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
 I've already got 50K, what's another 10K in debt?

771
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,000
 And you're adding on to it,

772
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,160
 add on onto it thinking like,

773
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,720
 someday I'll get married, and they'll love me so much,

774
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,200
 they'll be like, you know what, I got this.

775
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
 Here's 50 grand, just take it.

776
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,280
 And you know, it'll go away.

777
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,680
 And that's not gonna happen.

778
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,960
 Generally, or it's at least not a great plan to happen.

779
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,040
 Others of you are gonna take finances,

780
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,400
 you're gonna be like, dude, the Bible says,

781
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
 borrow a slave to the lender, it's in Proverbs.

782
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,840
 And I'm gonna make the decision

783
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,240
 where I wanna do everything I can

784
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,400
 to honor God with my finances, I wanna get out of debt.

785
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,960
 And here's the other thing that you're gonna do,

786
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,040
 'cause you're gonna live according to what the Bible says.

787
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,800
 You're gonna have something that no amount of money,

788
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,240
 no house, no amount in your bank account

789
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,600
 will ever give you contentment.

790
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,680
 Because you're gonna make the decision,

791
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,160
 I'm gonna live what God says,

792
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,240
 how God says I should as it relates to money.

793
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,400
 Others of you in your career, like you're gonna sow,

794
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,120
 and it's not gonna be in the direction of faithfulness,

795
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,400
 and your job, like I'm just telling you,

796
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,000
 the next 10 years, here's what it's gonna look like,

797
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,840
 and I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

798
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,960
 You're gonna jump from one job to the next to the next,

799
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,480
 'cause you're like, you're gonna find yourself like,

800
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,440
 dude, I'm just trying to be real here.

801
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,400
 You're gonna get in a job,

802
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,520
 and you're gonna be there for like a year and a half,

803
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
 you're gonna be like, I just feel like

804
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
 I'm not passionate about this, no one here appreciates me,

805
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,160
 and I feel like, honestly, I'm underpaid, let's be honest.

806
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,080
 How much does Becky make?

807
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,280
 Becky doesn't feel like she's doing that much,

808
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,400
 and you're gonna jump out of that job,

809
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,840
 thinking everybody else is the problem.

810
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,240
 You're gonna get in a job for a year and a half,

811
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,080
 and you're gonna find yourself

812
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
 thinking the exact same things,

813
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
 never dealing with the entitlement

814
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,200
 and the narcissism that's there,

815
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,720
 and you're gonna jump again, going, you know what?

816
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,880
 I gotta find something I'm passionate about,

817
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,040
 not realizing every job on the planet

818
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,200
 has days and parts of it

819
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
 where you're just not passionate about that.

820
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,340
 And you know what, you're gonna forfeit

821
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,080
 getting good at your job.

822
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,120
 So you're gonna be 30 and jumping again,

823
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,080
 being like, I think I'm gonna explore a new career,

824
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,680
 and there's times that everybody transitions,

825
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,080
 so I'm not saying this is all the way wrong,

826
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,880
 but if you're the person who jumps and jumps and jumps,

827
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,080
 you should be concerned.

828
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:32,000
 And you will forfeit actually getting good at your job

829
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,720
 and forfeit forming deep, 'cause it just takes time.

830
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,560
 Like, you know that, right?

831
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,640
 Like, it takes time to be good at anything.

832
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,480
 And you're also gonna forfeit, like,

833
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,960
 deep relationships where you work,

834
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
 having a ministry presence where you work

835
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
 because of deep relationships that are there.

836
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
 Others of you are gonna make the decision

837
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,040
 that, hey, I'm gonna have long faithfulness

838
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,120
 here at this job until it is so clear

839
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,400
 God has called me somewhere else

840
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,320
 and I'm gonna go do something else.

841
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,080
 And there's times where he does that.

842
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,040
 But you're gonna make the decision,

843
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,760
 man, I'm gonna go in, I'm gonna be faithful,

844
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,200
 I'm gonna work hard, I'm gonna show up early,

845
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,320
 I'm gonna leave late, I'm gonna honor my boss,

846
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,920
 I'm gonna set low expectations for everyone else,

847
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,880
 and I'm gonna seek to serve them

848
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
 and honor the people I'm working.

849
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,080
 And you're gonna experience life and thriving there.

850
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,600
 Spiritually, some of you are going to just,

851
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,840
 like, tonight, you're like, dude, you're just,

852
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,480
 you're being too mean, I'm never coming back here.

853
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,400
 So that's okay.

854
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,440
 And you're gonna leave here,

855
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,680
 and I hope that's not the case,

856
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
 but you're gonna leave here and,

857
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,480
 regardless, whatever the reason is,

858
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,920
 you're not gonna step back in church for a while

859
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,840
 or you're just gonna have kind of a church hopping,

860
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,320
 like, I just, every now and then, pop in, good vibes,

861
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,880
 gotta get a little fill, then I go back on my way.

862
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,500
 And your faith is gonna continue to wither and suffocate.

863
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,620
 You can't eat once a week.

864
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,080
 Just like you can't eat once a week,

865
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,200
 or you shouldn't be spiritually fed once a week.

866
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,040
 And that's what you're gonna do.

867
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,440
 And your 20s are gonna be wasted away,

868
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,200
 and you're spiritually not gonna grow with God.

869
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,040
 And you know what?

870
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,120
 You're gonna call a friend in, like, three years

871
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,960
 who's here and say, I just feel really distant from God.

872
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,200
 There's no mystery there.

873
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,280
 You've continued to walk and walk, walk,

874
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,960
 distantly from God.

875
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,840
 He still loves you, crazy about you,

876
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,140
 welcomes you like a father anytime you return.

877
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,500
 And others of you are gonna say,

878
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,960
 man, I'm gonna take this decade

879
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,680
 and I'm gonna make decisions that are gonna lead

880
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,960
 towards the path of the person that I wanna become.

881
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,360
 It's small daily decisions,

882
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,640
 and I'm gonna invest and grow my relationship with God.

883
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,120
 It's crazy how small things daily

884
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,200
 can be so transformative over time.

885
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,000
 Like, do you know if you read the Bible,

886
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,120
 10 minutes a day, if you listen to the Bible,

887
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,940
 10 minutes a day, so whatever your commute is,

888
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,400
 if you take 10 minutes of that,

889
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,040
 and you read or you listen to the Bible,

890
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,420
 in a year, you will have finished reading an entire Bible.

891
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,060
 10 minutes a day.

892
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,240
 If you decided, you know what?

893
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,620
 I wanna memorize some verses this year.

894
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,680
 If you said, I'm gonna memorize a verse a day,

895
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,260
 by the end of the year, you would have memorized

896
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,080
 or could have memorized Ephesians, Philippians,

897
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,640
 and Colossians combined.

898
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,680
 It's just little small deposits of faithfulness,

899
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
 and some of you are doing it, and you're gonna do it,

900
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,880
 and you're gonna reap an incredible harvest,

901
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,800
 the Apostle Paul says, of hiding God's word

902
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,840
 inside of your heart.

903
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:21,820
 This idea of like, man, staying on the right path,

904
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,280
 continuing towards the right direction,

905
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,080
 small decisions, and a moment by moment,

906
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,160
 determine the direction and destination of my life,

907
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,840
 never goes away.

908
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,960
 This past week, I was gathering with my community group,

909
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,340
 and I was sharing with those guys,

910
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,620
 hey, I just need you to pray for me and hold me accountable.

911
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,260
 I've been having lustful thoughts about women

912
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,840
 who are not my wife, and I don't want those thoughts

913
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,560
 to lead me towards habits, to actions,

914
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,160
 to anything that takes me away from being the man

915
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
 that I want, and you may be here for the first time,

916
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,640
 and like, did a pastor just say,

917
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,160
 he has lustful thoughts about a woman who's not his wife?

918
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,660
 Yes, because I'm a human, and I hate it,

919
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,760
 and I need guys in my life who can pray for me,

920
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,160
 hold me accountable, ask me about it,

921
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
 so I invite them in, because here's what I know.

922
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,240
 I can either suffer in silence,

923
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,680
 continue to feed that temptation on my own,

924
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
 and it's gonna take me to a path,

925
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,840
 and I don't want to be the 40-year-old man

926
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,300
 who's still constantly feeding his mind

927
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,360
 with thoughts sexually of people other than his wife.

928
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,740
 I want the last time I've ever had a thought like that

929
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,800
 to be behind me.

930
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,780
 Maybe that's not possible, 'cause sin nature's a real thing,

931
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,160
 but I want as much as I can to make sure,

932
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,200
 hey, I'm not allowing that thought,

933
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,080
 and I wanna get it out in the open,

934
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,280
 and I need you to pray for me, I need you to know about it.

935
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,640
 This is not who I wanna be,

936
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,000
 'cause I wanna plant the right seeds.

937
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,640
 Are you planting the right seeds?

938
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,520
 Finally, Paul says, "Let us not become weary in doing good."

939
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,480
 And he switches and really backs up

940
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,600
 and gives a nod or implication

941
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,760
 of the eternal harvest that comes,

942
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,980
 but he says, "Don't grow weary in doing good,

943
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,700
 "for at the proper time, we will reap a harvest

944
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,760
 "if we do not give up."

945
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,140
 He switches and begins to talk about,

946
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,900
 hey, it's gonna be worth it.

947
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,860
 Continue to sow the right seeds,

948
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,060
 to make the right decisions,

949
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,540
 and I promise you, it's gonna be worth it.

950
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,740
 And he begins to talk about eternity,

951
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,180
 and he's basically saying, it's worth it

952
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,980
 in this life and the life to come.

953
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,020
 It's gonna be worth it, hold onto it,

954
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,980
 continue to make the decisions in those moments

955
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,100
 where it is so difficult, and it's difficult,

956
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,300
 let's just be honest.

957
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,300
 He says, it's gonna be worth it.

958
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,380
 Continue to sow the right seeds.

959
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,340
 Wherever you're at today, wherever you've been,

960
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,500
 you can today begin to sow the right seeds in your life.

961
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,820
 And Paul says, it is gonna be worth it.

962
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,500
 The third idea, or third point from this text,

963
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,940
 the promise that doing good pays off.

964
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,940
 The promise that doing good pays off.

965
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,060
 I heard from another pastor this week,

966
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,660
 a story that was related to a study that was done

967
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,820
 by a group of 1,000 individuals,

968
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,380
 and they divided the group in two,

969
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,620
 and they said, hey, you guys are gonna put sunscreen

970
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,580
 on your face every single day.

971
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,660
 If it's sunny outside, or if it's not sunny outside,

972
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,380
 put sunscreen on your face every single day.

973
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,020
 And then the other group, they were told,

974
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,100
 just put sunscreen on whenever you want,

975
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,860
 or if you're going out into the sun.

976
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,580
 So group, every single day, even when it's raining outside,

977
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,300
 put it on your face, group, just put it on

978
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
 when it's sunny, or whenever you want.

979
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,140
 And over a 10-year period, they studied

980
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,100
 both of these groups at the end of the time,

981
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,860
 and they discovered a significant reduction,

982
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,820
 not in cancer, or in sunburn, or any of the things

983
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,060
 that you would, of course, in the aging of their faces.

984
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,460
 That a significant, like a change,

985
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,900
 significant, above 25%, that hey,

986
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,460
 the group that put on sunscreen every single day

987
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,780
 significantly aged less than the group that did not.

988
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,700
 That they were able, based on these small decisions,

989
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,660
 to determine, hey, what their future,

990
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,680
 and what they are going to look like in the future.

991
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,300
 What does that have to do with us?

992
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,220
 Nothing, but the porch is beginning to sell sunscreen,

993
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,660
 and if you swipe up on our porch app,

994
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,060
 you can use the promo code, PORCH2020,

995
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,500
 and David, sunscreen, and no, that's not at all it.

996
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,100
 The idea that hey, based on these small decisions,

997
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,800
 you can see who you're becoming.

998
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,620
 You can see what is in your future,

999
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,980
 and Paul says it's worth it, just like that small decision,

1000
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
 sunscreen every day, it's worth it.

1001
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:24,300
 The decision is to study God's word, to live in community.

1002
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,860
 To do the hard thing when it's the right thing,

1003
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,460
 even if it leads to breaking off a relationship,

1004
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,780
 getting out of a financial situation that you can't afford.

1005
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,880
 He says it's worth it.

1006
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,460
 Living according to his word, it's worth it,

1007
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,100
 and in the end, you're gonna see it.

1008
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,900
 And living for yourself or any other thing in your 20s,

1009
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,460
 or for just your 20s and your 30s,

1010
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,060
 is too small of a thing to live for,

1011
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,700
 and a foolish thing to give your life for.

1012
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,940
 So not only is it worth it, because in eternity,

1013
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,300
 you're gonna experience for all the good

1014
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,700
 and the ways that you sow spiritual things in your life,

1015
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,160
 you're gonna experience a reward and benefit

1016
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,000
 for all of eternity.

1017
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,980
 Not only is it worth it for all of eternity because of that,

1018
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,620
 but because it is too small of a thing

1019
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,820
 to give your life to just yourself.

1020
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,840
 To you making a name for yourself, or getting more money,

1021
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,460
 or just having the love story that you want,

1022
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,100
 or getting that rich and famous,

1023
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,320
 or a million Instagram followers,

1024
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,120
 or whatever else you think that is worth it out there.

1025
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,920
 Those are too small of things to give your life towards.

1026
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,080
 Why do I say that?

1027
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,360
 Think about, let me say it this way.

1028
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,800
 I was talking to my team, we were talking about the 1920s,

1029
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,280
 and I asked, "Hey, does anyone know

1030
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,220
 "who was president in the 1920s?"

1031
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,880
 And it's kind of a funny question

1032
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,820
 'cause there's three of 'em.

1033
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,540
 And not a single person knew who was president.

1034
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,800
 I'm guessing most people in this room

1035
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,140
 don't know who was president in the 1920s.

1036
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,900
 And maybe some of us do, but think about that.

1037
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,820
 It's Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover,

1038
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
 and Wilson at the very beginning of 'em.

1039
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,020
 Think about that.

1040
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,080
 The president of the United States,

1041
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,480
 the highest office in the land,

1042
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,300
 the greatest holding of success you could have

1043
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,640
 in terms of worldly standards,

1044
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,180
 most people would say the leader of the free world.

1045
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,900
 100 years from now, no one knows who they were.

1046
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,580
 Most of you, you know nothing about Herbert Hoover.

1047
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,700
 You're like, "Is that the vacuum guy?

1048
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,840
 "I thought it was the vacuum guy.

1049
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,180
 "He was the president?"

1050
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,180
 No, not the vacuum guy, president.

1051
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,060
 Calvin Coolidge, most of us think that,

1052
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,940
 isn't that a cartoon?

1053
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,680
 I thought that was a cartoon.

1054
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,340
 You have no idea who that is.

1055
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,380
 This is the highest achievement man can make,

1056
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,920
 and in 100 years, no one knows who they are.

1057
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,380
 No one is going to know who you are or who I am.

1058
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,300
 You living for yourself, your own kingdom

1059
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,580
 is too small and foolish of a thing to live for.

1060
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,160
 And the God who's there, listen to me,

1061
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,580
 has invited you in your 20s and in your 30s

1062
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,400
 to live for something so much bigger than yourself.

1063
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,760
 This is the most unique time period of your life.

1064
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,260
 Like no other time period that you're gonna have,

1065
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,580
 you have more time, energy, availability to serve Christ,

1066
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,940
 to do something amazing.

1067
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,860
 All of the disciples, what do they have in common?

1068
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,640
 They were all young adults.

1069
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,420
 Every major revival in our nation,

1070
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,620
 you know what it all had in common?

1071
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,980
 It was all led by young adults.

1072
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,140
 Most of the people, candidly, that you respect

1073
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,300
 when you look back in history book,

1074
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,420
 you know what they have in common?

1075
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,420
 They were all young adults, 20s and 30s.

1076
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,520
 Martin Luther King, yesterday,

1077
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,580
 how old was he when he died?

1078
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,460
 35.

1079
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,220
 He spent most of the years by which you're like, "Wow."

1080
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,420
 Forming and developing his character,

1081
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,180
 and then for the few years before,

1082
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,360
 having an incredible impact.

1083
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,280
 My point is this.

1084
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,220
 This is the time where if God's gonna use you,

1085
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,900
 and he wants to use you, and he will use you,

1086
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,340
 and he always historically has used young adults,

1087
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:30,180
 where it is your chance to not give your life

1088
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,160
 to the bar scene, to give your life to living,

1089
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,300
 to make a million dollars.

1090
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,980
 How foolish of a thing is that?

1091
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,520
 Where you can give your life

1092
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,900
 to the thing that you were made for,

1093
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,600
 the own relationship that satisfies,

1094
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,840
 to expanding and showing the world around us,

1095
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,900
 the one that they were made for, their Savior.

1096
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,020
 And if God is gonna use you,

1097
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,540
 and over and over and over again,

1098
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,980
 it's in this unique time period,

1099
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,780
 candidly, this age, in this limited time window,

1100
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,860
 where God grabs the hearts of young adults,

1101
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,660
 and he uses them to spark something.

1102
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,860
 And I hate that so many of us,

1103
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,500
 despite everything or anything that I'd say,

1104
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,980
 or as much as I would try to plead for that to happen,

1105
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,740
 it's fallen on deaf ears.

1106
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,940
 And you're gonna leave,

1107
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,660
 and you're gonna continue to just be obsessed

1108
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,580
 with what the world around us thinks,

1109
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,820
 and living for yourself, and what a waste.

1110
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,660
 But my heart and my hope is that some of you,

1111
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,660
 you're gonna get it, and you're gonna decide,

1112
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,040
 I'm going all in with this, with Jesus,

1113
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,260
 with what he invites me to.

1114
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:38,340
 And you're gonna experience, Paul says, life,

1115
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,940
 in this one and the one to come.

1116
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,860
 In conclusion, the principle of decision-making

1117
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,060
 is that you reap what you sow.

1118
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,100
 The path that you're on is defined

1119
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,180
 by the decisions that we make.

1120
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,740
 And there is a promise, God says, it will pay off.

1121
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:59,860
 Interestingly, the 1920s are iconic,

1122
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,740
 because it was a time that was so exciting,

1123
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,820
 and just booming, and everyone was like,

1124
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,060
 money, money, money, and it was scandalous,

1125
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,320
 and there was kind of a recklessness,

1126
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,980
 like as much as I was kidding about the dress

1127
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,380
 that they had, it was like, wow, this is so crazy.

1128
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,740
 And people were investing money like crazy.

1129
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,620
 The economy quadrupled.

1130
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,140
 People were taking out loans

1131
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,300
 to put it into the stock market.

1132
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,220
 Think about that.

1133
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,780
 And it just, money, money, money,

1134
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,820
 and people had a mentality that was like,

1135
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,020
 the music's never gonna stop, let the party continue,

1136
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,560
 let the champagne roll.

1137
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,260
 And eventually, that reckless mentality

1138
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,940
 led to some reckless decision-making

1139
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,920
 around the stock market and finances.

1140
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,380
 And all of a sudden, that perspective that,

1141
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,140
 hey, the party will never end, it's only up and up,

1142
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,900
 all of it came crashing down.

1143
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,860
 And what followed was a Great Depression.

1144
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,020
 And so many of the people who lived through that,

1145
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,860
 like the party, music won't ever stop,

1146
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,040
 the music stopped, and they had to go through a depression.

1147
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,580
 And you know, if you have any grandparents

1148
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,820
 that lived through the Great Depression,

1149
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,780
 there's something that most of them have in common,

1150
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,620
 where they're all like, very sober-minded because of it.

1151
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,260
 Like, you're like, Grandma, look,

1152
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,780
 can I just have one scoop of mayonnaise on the sandwich?

1153
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,020
 She's like, you can have half a scoop.

1154
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,100
 Half a scoop for you.

1155
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,380
 That she's just like, I just don't know

1156
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,620
 what's gonna happen because that crash

1157
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,260
 and depression sobered them.

1158
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,380
 Some of you, tragically, tonight,

1159
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,980
 you're listening and you're listening where you are,

1160
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,380
 in 17 locations, or you're listening to this podcast,

1161
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,700
 and you're, despite all of the things

1162
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,820
 that God clearly says, you are not going to listen.

1163
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,260
 And you're gonna continue a mentality

1164
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,240
 that I'm gonna live how I want during this phase of life,

1165
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,480
 it's not that big of a deal, dude,

1166
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,820
 I'll be the exception to the rule,

1167
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,660
 and I want you to hear me, it's going to come crashing down.

1168
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,060
 And when it does, there's gonna be a depression

1169
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,540
 of sorts that follows.

1170
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,700
 And it's gonna have implications

1171
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,560
 for your 30s and your 40s.

1172
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,980
 And in the midst of that, you know what's true?

1173
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,340
 God's gonna meet you there.

1174
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,340
 And that depression will be something, hopefully,

1175
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,900
 God uses to grab your heart and bring you back to him.

1176
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,980
 Say, I've never been angry at you, I love you,

1177
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,780
 I've always wanted life for you, and I still offer that.

1178
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,180
 But you're gonna have to sow according to my ways,

1179
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,300
 but others of you, you're not gonna allow

1180
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,900
 that reckless music will never stop mentality

1181
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,220
 to shape and define your life.

1182
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
 You're gonna live according to his word

1183
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,100
 and sow the things into your life

1184
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,900
 that are gonna lead towards the life

1185
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,260
 that in your heart of hearts you want,

1186
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,020
 a life that aligns with God's word.

1187
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,560
 I'll close right here.

1188
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,260
 I want you to think about something with me,

1189
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,220
 each of you individually, wherever you are.

1190
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,220
 It's 2020, how old are you?

1191
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,460
 You don't have to say it out loud, just get the number.

1192
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,140
 In 2030, how old are you gonna be?

1193
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,740
 I don't know if you're gonna be 27,

1194
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,340
 which would be really young for you to be in here, actually,

1195
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,140
 or 37, (audience laughing)

1196
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:59,140
 or 32, or 38, or 39,

1197
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,220
 42, whatever that number is.

1198
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,260
 It's your 42nd birthday, it's your 36th birthday.

1199
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,300
 Your friends all get together,

1200
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,820
 and I just want you to go there with me in your mind.

1201
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,460
 Your friends get together, you're 36, 35,

1202
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,300
 whatever that number is, fill in the blank for you.

1203
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,300
 They all get together and they're like,

1204
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,740
 hey, it's Lisa's party, or it's Caleb's party,

1205
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,780
 or Chris, or whatever.

1206
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,260
 We're getting all together, we have the birthday party,

1207
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,920
 they're going to Bowling Barrel, they're celebrating you,

1208
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,940
 it's gonna be awesome, or wherever you like to party.

1209
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,820
 And you're there, and they bring out the cake

1210
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,420
 and they got the number of candles just for your birthday,

1211
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,260
 35.

1212
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,500
 Who do you want to be in that moment?

1213
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,540
 Who's gonna be in that room?

1214
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,020
 What's the type of person that you wanna be there?

1215
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,900
 Do you still wanna be someone who continues

1216
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,340
 to look at pornography every single day?

1217
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,180
 Do you still wanna be someone

1218
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,060
 who's in a dysfunctional dating relationship

1219
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,620
 that, man, they just kind of never grew out of,

1220
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,460
 perpetually engaged?

1221
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,540
 Do you still wanna be someone whose life is marked by,

1222
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,180
 I'm just so anxious all the time, I'm covered in anxiety,

1223
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,820
 I'm taking medication constantly

1224
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,320
 to cope with the anxiety around me,

1225
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,860
 I've got a drinking problem that I can't cope with?

1226
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,980
 Do you wanna be someone who has peace?

1227
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,580
 Maybe who's in a healthy relationship

1228
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,040
 or married in that moment, not perfect.

1229
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,540
 Someone who's found that their identity

1230
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,820
 didn't come from what other people think

1231
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,340
 and I don't have to worry about pleasing other people,

1232
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,860
 I have the approval of God, what else do I need?

1233
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,420
 I don't know what you would fill in the blank

1234
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,360
 and what that future version you would love to see,

1235
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,160
 but here's what I know, or here's what I wanna ask.

1236
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,620
 How do you think you're going to get there?

1237
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,260
 It won't happen overnight.

1238
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,980
 In other words, the decisions that you're making,

1239
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,100
 if you got this future version of just walking with God

1240
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,360
 and family, that doesn't happen overnight.

1241
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,220
 It doesn't happen in a moment.

1242
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,460
 It happens moment by moment and the decisions

1243
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,400
 and the days between now and then will define

1244
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,340
 what and who you will be at that party.

1245
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,820
 Are you becoming the person that you want to be

1246
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,000
 for those moments?

1247
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,500
 And so let me close by iterating.

1248
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,340
 How?

1249
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,540
 How?

1250
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,860
 How, God, do I become the husband?

1251
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,340
 I'm gonna be 43.

1252
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,580
 How do I become the dad that I wanna be at 43?

1253
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,920
 How do I become more patient, more in love with Jesus,

1254
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,840
 more generous with my time and my money?

1255
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,980
 How do I become everything that I want to be?

1256
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,580
 'Cause you know what, every single day, God,

1257
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,860
 I wake up and there's things that fight for my heart,

1258
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,660
 anxiety that can fill my mind,

1259
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,860
 distractions that make me think I don't have enough money,

1260
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,740
 I don't have enough appreciation from other people,

1261
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,580
 things that can make me think that I'm entitled

1262
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,280
 more than I am or entitled in general

1263
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,280
 and just can flood my mind, distractions.

1264
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,060
 Man, there's women that I wanna lust over all the time.

1265
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,660
 How do I become someone who's the husband, the father,

1266
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,200
 the man, the pastor, the person,

1267
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,860
 the follower of Jesus that I wanna be?

1268
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:55,700
 How?

1269
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,100
 It's not by just waking up and saying,

1270
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,140
 you know what, today's my day, I'm gonna try harder.

1271
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,020
 It's by saying, God, I don't have the strength,

1272
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,860
 listen to me very closely, 'cause I don't want you to leave

1273
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,120
 with all the different things that I've said

1274
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,180
 and walk away being like, yeah, just really like,

1275
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,200
 go help, self-help.

1276
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,020
 You're not strong enough and neither am I

1277
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,260
 to become the man that I wanna be.

1278
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,660
 You're not strong enough to become the woman

1279
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,500
 that you wanna be.

1280
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,860
 You can't conquer anxiety.

1281
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,900
 You can't conquer lust.

1282
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,580
 You can't conquer all the self-identity and problems

1283
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,580
 like, you know why I know that?

1284
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,500
 Because if you could, you already would have.

1285
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,820
 You're not strong enough on your own and neither am I.

1286
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,300
 And so the moment that we experience freedom from those

1287
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,940
 is when we go, God, I need your help.

1288
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,580
 I surrender, I need your help.

1289
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,100
 And I don't need it just for all the time, though.

1290
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,940
 I need it all the time.

1291
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,820
 I need it just for today.

1292
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,860
 Will you help me today, God?

1293
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,420
 Will you help me in this moment where I'm feeling temptation

1294
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,700
 to not be your man, to not be the man that I wanna be?

1295
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,740
 Will you help me right now, God?

1296
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,300
 I need your help, God, I need your help.

1297
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,140
 Just moment by moment, moment by moment,

1298
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,000
 I surrender my life.

1299
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,060
 It's the same way you become a Christian.

1300
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,140
 Christians don't try harder.

1301
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,380
 And then you can be in relationship with God.

1302
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,260
 They say, God, I can't, I don't deserve it.

1303
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,420
 I'm not good enough on my own.

1304
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,020
 I need your help.

1305
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,820
 I surrender.

1306
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,180
 You pay for it.

1307
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,380
 If I'm gonna have a relationship with you,

1308
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,940
 it's not because of me.

1309
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,660
 I surrender.

1310
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,900
 I need your help.

1311
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,700
 That is how you live the Christian life.

1312
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,020
 That's how your 20s thrive and roar.

1313
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,780
 How about you getting so motivated, you walk out of here

1314
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,420
 and you're like, I'm never sinning again.

1315
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,180
 By moment by moment, God, I need you.

1316
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,100
 I surrender.

1317
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,060
 I need your help.

1318
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,260
 I can't be who I want to be without you.

1319
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,240
 Will you help me?

1320
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,780
 And in those moments, God doesn't just move his spirit in

1321
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,420
 and that's how he saves somebody.

1322
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,620
 Those are the moments that he directs and sows

1323
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,060
 and moves our lives and the directions that we want them to,

1324
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,540
 that he wants them to.

1325
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,260
 So we say, God, you drive.

1326
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,600
 You're the Lord.

1327
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,860
 I give you my life.

1328
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,900
 I give you this day.

1329
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,900
 I wanna give you this moment.

1330
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,340
 Help me.

1331
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,260
 Let me pray.

1332
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,160
 Father, I pray.

1333
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:07,060
 Man, for just friends in here that feel

1334
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:13,180
 like they're too far,

1335
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,580
 like they're damaged goods.

1336
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:22,180
 They'll never be able to have the story that they hoped for.

1337
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,780
 They're not even sure that you are God

1338
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,780
 whose word and love and life was given for them.

1339
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,360
 You would meet them where they are right now.

1340
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,400
 The spirit of God would overwhelm and flood their heart

1341
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,500
 as you say it does in Romans chapter five.

1342
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,840
 And you would give them a vision for the life

1343
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,160
 that's bigger than anything they've ever dreamed.

1344
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,880
 Father, I pray for men and women in this room

1345
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,580
 who are gonna run and they're not gonna listen

1346
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,300
 and they're not gonna use their 20s and you love them.

1347
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,480
 And there's parts of all of our hearts that wanna run.

1348
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,320
 Would you help us?

1349
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,240
 Would you win?

1350
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,960
 Would you be greater and stronger

1351
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,640
 in those moments as we surrender to you?

1352
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,500
 And I thank you, God, for the men and women

1353
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,440
 who are sowing seeds of life.

1354
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,320
 Would you multiply those seeds as you do when we sow them?

1355
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,760
 And would you spread a movement of their kind

1356
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,040
 across our country of young adults surrendered

1357
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,520
 and walking surrendered to you day by day?

1358
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,240
 In Christ's name, amen.
