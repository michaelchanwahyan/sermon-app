00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,020
 [Music]

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,020
 [Music]

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,020
 Porsche, let me hear from you, how we feeling tonight?

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,020
 Yeah, let's go.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,040
 Hey, I have thought about it over the course of the last week

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,040
 and I think I am in on this Tuesday thing.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,040
 I think I will keep coming back week after week.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
 How do y'all feel?

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
 Y'all feel good about that?

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,040
 Hey, we have some very special friends joining us, not only

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,040
 here in Dallas but also from around the nation.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,060
 We have some friends tuning in, Porsche Live locations, Boise,

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,060
 Indy, Greater Lafayette.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,060
 So glad you are jumping in with us tonight.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,060
 Hey, I am excited for this evening.

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,060
 I am excited to continue our series ins and outs.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,060
 But before we get into the meat of what we have for tonight, I

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
 want to start off with a simple question.

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,060
 But I need your participation.

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,060
 So quick show of hands.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,080
 Who in the room wants to find fulfillment in life?

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
 Show of hands.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
 Show of hands.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
 Show of hands.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
 Keep them up.

27
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 Keep them up.

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
 Now just take a look around.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,080
 Like what you see as you gaze around this room is it's all of

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 us.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
 Like it's not just you.

32
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,100
 You are not the exception in your pursuit of fulfillment.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,100
 Everybody in this room is searching for it.

34
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,100
 Which reminds me of a story.

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,100
 It reminds me of the time that I lost my Aggie ring.

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,100
 So every Thanksgiving my family gets together and we play a

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,100
 backyard football game.

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,100
 Anybody else do that with your families at Thanksgiving?

39
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,100
 We do this every single year.

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,120
 And over the course of the years the game has gotten increasingly

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 competitive as my cousins and my nieces and nephews have gotten

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
 older.

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 And so we're playing this last year and what is happening is

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,120
 we're in the backyard and it's fourth quarter and my team is

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
 down a couple of scores.

46
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
 And we're getting pretty heated.

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
 And so I do the only sensible thing that an honest competitor

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
 would do.

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,140
 I look at my 8-year-old nephew and I bench the guy.

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,140
 Hey, man, I have to play quarterback now.

51
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
 You can't do this anymore.

52
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,140
 I need to do it instead.

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,140
 Because we have a stage to come back and we start doing it.

54
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,140
 Like I'm throwing passes, dishing the ball.

55
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,140
 We've got deep fades and out routes and stop and goes.

56
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,160
 Like we're making our way back into the game until we're only

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,160
 at the fourth and it's the final possession of the game.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 And so knowing that we've got an opportunity here, my brother, he

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,160
 streams down the left side of the field and I launch a ball

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
 his direction.

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,180
 And in the process I launch my Aggie ring.

62
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,180
 Now in a moment like that you realize what you truly value in

63
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,180
 life.

64
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,180
 And what became immediately clear to me is that my ring meant way

65
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,180
 more to me than that game.

66
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
 Because I immediately shut the thing down.

67
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
 Stop!

68
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,180
 Like no more.

69
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
 We can't play.

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,180
 And I recruited my entire family to help.

71
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,180
 Help!

72
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,200
 Like everybody get over here.

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 Oh, my God, what happened to you?

74
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
 I lost my Aggie ring.

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
 Okay.

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 I'm sure it's around here somewhere.

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
 Don't worry.

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 And so we go through the process of walking the yard and just

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
 trying to see if we can find it.

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
 No luck.

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
 And so we get strategic.

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,220
 We get together and we form a line and we start to sweep the

83
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,220
 yard together to see if we can find the ring.

84
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
 Still nothing.

85
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,220
 And so I then make everybody get on their hands and knees and

86
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,240
 scour through the grass trying to see if they can pick out my

87
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
 ring, my Nana included.

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
 It's still nothing.

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
 Like we had no luck whatsoever.

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,240
 And so I can feel like the cold chill of panic, like a wet

91
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
 blanket just falling over me.

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 That I'm not going to find this thing until I realize I still

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,240
 had one, one more solution in my back pocket.

94
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,240
 I could go buy a metal detector.

95
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
 So I did.

96
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,260
 I got in my pickup.

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,260
 I drove to academy and I got one off the shelf.

98
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
 Immediately ran back home.

99
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,260
 Unboxed that thing.

100
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,260
 Started working through the intricacies of treasure hunting

101
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,260
 and started making my way across the yard to find my Aggie ring.

102
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,260
 And you know what I found?

103
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
 Gold.

104
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
 Because here it is.

105
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,280
 Now why do I tell you that?

106
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,280
 Because I think a lot of us are searching for fulfillment in

107
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,280
 the same way.

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,280
 Like we're moving through the proverbial backyard of 2024 and

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 we're on the hunt for fulfillment.

110
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,300
 And now we may be varied in our intensity during that hunt.

111
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,300
 And yet nonetheless we're still looking for fulfillment.

112
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,300
 The reason I know this is the case is because last week we

113
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,300
 talked about how statistically the research shows this year we

114
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,300
 are in for three things.

115
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
 We are in for self-acceptance, self-fulfillment and

116
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,320
 self-reliance.

117
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
 And so this is something that we have prescribed as being the top

118
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,320
 of our list.

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
 This is what we are in for more than anything else.

120
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 So if this is what we're hunting down, it begs the question.

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
 How do we find it?

122
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,320
 Well, how do you find anything in life?

123
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,320
 You ask someone that's found it before.

124
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,340
 Right now I'm on the great mission of figuring out what the

125
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,340
 best Mexican food restaurant is in Dallas, Texas.

126
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,340
 If you have any recommendations, come talk to me afterwards.

127
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
 But I'm asking the question.

128
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
 I'm talking to my team.

129
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,340
 I'm trying to understand where is the best Mexican food in the

130
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,340
 area.

131
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,340
 And the reason why I'm asking them is they have already

132
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,340
 gathered the insights that can help me to learn quicker where

133
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,360
 to go.

134
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
 They know better than I do.

135
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,360
 You see, personal experience isn't the best teacher.

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 Someone else's experience is.

137
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 Why should I spend the money when they've already spent it?

138
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,360
 I'm trying to ask them how do I find what it is I'm looking for?

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 What we see tonight in Psalm 73 is the story of a guy that

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 actually did find fulfillment.

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,360
 He goes by the name of Asaph.

142
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,380
 Asaph is a worship leader.

143
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,380
 He was appointed by David as the worship leader over the

144
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
 tabernacle choir.

145
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,380
 And what we see as we jump into Psalm 73 is he knows how to

146
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,380
 find fulfillment.

147
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,380
 But he doesn't know how to find fulfillment.

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
 It's not where we might be expecting.

149
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,400
 If you have a Bible, turn with me to Psalm 73.

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
 If this is your first time, I alluded to it but we're in a

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
 brand-new series called Ins and Outs.

152
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,400
 What we know about this series, we're asking the question, do my

153
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
 goals line up with God's will for my life?

154
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
 Here's what you need to know.

155
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
 Cards on the table up front.

156
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,420
 He's just in on you finding it somewhere specific.

157
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,420
 Psalm 73, this is what it says, starting in verse 1.

158
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,420
 It says...

159
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,420
 Right out of the gate it's pretty clear, our guy Asaph, he

160
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
 isn't fulfilled.

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
 He's discontent.

162
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
 He feels some sense of frustration.

163
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
 It says so in verse 1.

164
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
 He says...

165
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
 He starts praying, God is good.

166
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
 But then he gets honest.

167
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
 And he says...

168
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:17,420
 You see, Asaph, he knows that God is good.

169
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,420
 He has no doubt in his mind that God is in fact good.

170
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,420
 The question for Asaph is whether or not God is good to

171
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
 him.

172
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,420
 This is the question in Asaph's mind.

173
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,420
 In verse 2 it says...

174
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
 He looks around and you know what he sees?

175
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
 What so many of us see.

176
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
 Everybody else has everything they want.

177
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,420
 They've attained and achieved and amassed for themselves all of

178
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,420
 the things that they want in life.

179
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
 Asaph feels that way.

180
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,420
 Even for the wicked.

181
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,420
 And yet it doesn't feel like that's the case for him.

182
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,420
 That could not be further from his reality.

183
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,420
 You see Asaph is going through the ancient equivalent of a

184
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
 quarter-life crisis.

185
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,420
 What some of us are familiar with.

186
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,420
 And psychologists define as a period of uncertainty and

187
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,420
 questioning that typically occurs when people feel trapped.

188
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
 Uninspired.

189
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,420
 And disillusioned during their 20s and 30s.

190
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
 This is a feeling some of you can relate to.

191
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
 Like you graduated college.

192
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
 You moved to the big city.

193
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
 You got the job you wanted.

194
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
 You got the big checks and you picked up the guy or the girl

195
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,420
 you were aiming at and you started living in the high rise

196
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,420
 and everything looks the way you wanted.

197
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,420
 And yet on the other side of it you woke up one day and you

198
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,420
 realized this isn't at all as fulfilling as I thought it would

199
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
 be.

200
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,420
 I'm not nearly as satisfied with all of the trappings of a

201
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,420
 successful life like I thought I would be.

202
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,420
 I feel empty.

203
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,420
 Does that sound like your experience?

204
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,420
 This is Asaph's.

205
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,420
 This is what he's feeling.

206
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,420
 He's saying, man, I played by the rules.

207
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,420
 I've checked all the boxes.

208
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,420
 I've crossed the T's and done everything the way you're

209
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,420
 supposed to do it and yet I'm still missing something.

210
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,420
 He feels frustrated.

211
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,420
 He feels out of gas.

212
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,420
 He feels winded from all the work.

213
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,420
 He feels disappointed.

214
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,420
 Which is good.

215
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,420
 You may not be thinking that that is the case.

216
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,420
 And yet what we know in order to find fulfillment is we actually

217
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,420
 have to first and foremost identify what triggers our

218
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
 disappointment.

219
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,420
 If you want to find fulfillment, you must identify what triggers

220
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
 your disappointment.

221
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,420
 At first that feels like a bait and switch.

222
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,420
 Dude, I came here expecting to meet some people and have a

223
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,420
 great evening and spend time with my friends and here you talk

224
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,420
 about fulfillment.

225
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
 Sounds like an awesome night.

226
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
 And now you're talking about disappointment.

227
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
 So glad I came.

228
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,420
 Here's why we need to talk about disappointment before we get

229
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420
 into fulfillment.

230
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:31,420
 Because in order to figure out how to make something right, you

231
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,420
 must first understand why it is wrong.

232
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,420
 Like you can't make something right unless you first know

233
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,420
 what's wrong.

234
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
 This is why it's really important, fellas.

235
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,420
 If you're trying to date a beautiful young lady, you need

236
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,420
 to listen to her whenever you've upset her.

237
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,420
 Listen to her as in comprehend the words she's speaking.

238
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,420
 Because she's telling you, hey, this is what's wrong.

239
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,420
 That way you can make it right.

240
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,420
 You can't simply do it by way of offering flowers, buying

241
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
 chocolates, taking to dinner.

242
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,420
 You have to understand, comprehend what is wrong in the

243
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,420
 situation before you can effectively make it right.

244
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,420
 Author Brene Brown said really well, disappointment is unmet

245
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
 expectations.

246
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
 And the more significant the expectations, the more

247
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
 significant the disappointment.

248
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
 It's kind of like the idea of an appetite.

249
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,420
 Like when you get hungry, what's the natural response?

250
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
 To find some food.

251
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,420
 Which you expect to find because you went to the grocery store

252
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,420
 and stocked up like a responsible young adult.

253
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,420
 How do you feel when you swing open the pantry and nothing is

254
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,420
 in there because your roommate ate all of it?

255
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
 You're triggered.

256
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,420
 That's what happens.

257
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,420
 You immediately become disappointed.

258
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,420
 Like you had expectations of what would be there and yet

259
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
 those expectations didn't pan out.

260
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,420
 So you go from hungry to hangry.

261
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
 You turn into a monster.

262
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
 You become a different person.

263
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,420
 And yet it's sensible because a discouraged heart produces a

264
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,420
 distorted perspective.

265
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,420
 Like your outlook on life, it becomes bleak because your

266
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,420
 expectations have gone unmet.

267
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,420
 So how do we know what's discouraged our heart?

268
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,420
 How do we identify what triggers our disappointment?

269
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,420
 What source is behind our discontentment in life?

270
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
 How do we figure that out?

271
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,420
 Look at verse 3.

272
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,420
 For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the

273
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
 prosperity of the wicked.

274
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,420
 For they have no pangs until death.

275
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
 Their bodies are fat and sleek.

276
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
 They're not in trouble as others are.

277
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,420
 They're not stricken like the rest of mankind.

278
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,420
 Friends, if you want to identify what triggers your

279
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,420
 disappointment, then you need to recognize what evokes your envy.

280
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,420
 If you want to identify what triggers your disappointment,

281
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,420
 then you need to recognize what evokes your envy.

282
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,420
 If you want to identify what triggers your disappointment,

283
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,420
 then you need to recognize what evokes your envy.

284
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,420
 This is what happens for Asaph.

285
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,420
 Like his struggle with discontentment, it started the

286
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,420
 minute he looked away from God and started looking at everybody

287
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
 else around.

288
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,420
 And what you find is he just starts -- he starts casually

289
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
 scrolling on ancient Instagram.

290
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,420
 And he finds, man, hey, the prosperity of the wicked.

291
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,420
 They're wealthier than me.

292
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,420
 They have no pangs until death.

293
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,420
 They're healthier than me.

294
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
 Their bodies are fat and sleek.

295
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
 They're prettier than I am.

296
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,420
 They lack any kind of trouble.

297
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,420
 They're smarter than me.

298
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,420
 He saw they weren't stricken like the rest of mankind.

299
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
 They're happier than me.

300
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
 You think the Bible reads relevantly?

301
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,420
 Like Asaph deals here with what you deal there.

302
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,420
 He's wrestling with feelings of insecurity and inadequacy and

303
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
 insufficiency.

304
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
 No different than we do.

305
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
 The problems are the same.

306
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,420
 But that's good news because the solutions are too.

307
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,420
 You see what happens to Asaph, which happens to so many of us,

308
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,420
 is we walk unknowingly into the trap of comparison.

309
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,420
 Teddy Roosevelt, he famously said that comparison is a thief

310
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
 of joy.

311
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,420
 And when he was in the plane, turned that up a notch, he said

312
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
 that comparison is the death of joy.

313
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,420
 And the Bible has its own spin.

314
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
 In Proverbs 14.30 it says...

315
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:54,420
 The Bible wants you to know comparison is toxic to joy.

316
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
 It rots the bones.

317
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
 That's the nature.

318
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,420
 It's more than just looking and wanting what other people have.

319
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
 It's resenting them for it.

320
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
 They have what I want.

321
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,420
 And so I hate them.

322
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,420
 I want so badly to be where they are.

323
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,420
 And so I resent them.

324
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,420
 This is what happens to us whenever we take our eyes off of

325
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,420
 God and lay them upon other people.

326
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
 We stop looking for fulfillment in the right places.

327
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,420
 And what we find is disappointment instead.

328
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,420
 Friends, if you want to find fulfillment, then first you need

329
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,420
 to identify what triggers your disappointment.

330
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
 Where are you bitter in life?

331
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
 Like what consumes your head space?

332
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 Even tonight.

333
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
 Because you walked in.

334
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,420
 What's clouding your judgment?

335
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,420
 Blurring your vision?

336
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
 That's what Asaph does.

337
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
 He tries to understand himself.

338
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,420
 He wants to get under the layers of why is it that I'm so

339
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,420
 embittered against all of these other people.

340
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,420
 And so he says in verse 16...

341
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,420
 But when I thought of how to understand this, it seemed to be

342
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
 a wearisome task.

343
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,420
 Until I went into the sanctuary of God.

344
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
 Then I discerned their end.

345
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,420
 Truly you set them in slippery places, you make them fall to

346
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
 ruin.

347
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,420
 How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by

348
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
 terror.

349
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,420
 Like a dream when one awakes, oh, Lord, when you rouse yourself

350
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
 you despise them as phantoms.

351
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
 You are shrewd and ignorant.

352
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,420
 I was like a beast towards you.

353
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,420
 The second step towards finding fulfillment after you identify

354
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,420
 what triggers your disappointment is you have to

355
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
 keep eternity in perspective.

356
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
 You have to keep eternity in perspective.

357
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,420
 It's interesting.

358
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,420
 When you go and you study through Psalm 73, you'll find

359
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,420
 that it actually breaks down in a mirror form.

360
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,420
 It's what scholars call a chiastic structure.

361
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,420
 The first half of the psalm mirrors the second half of the

362
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
 psalm.

363
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,420
 The first half of the psalm talks about Asaph's old

364
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,420
 perspective on life and the second half talks about his new

365
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
 perspective on life.

366
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,420
 And any time you see a chiasm, the way you understand what the

367
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,420
 main point or one of the most significant elements of that

368
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,420
 psalm or that narrative or that epistle is, the way that you

369
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,420
 learn is you look at the hinge point.

370
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
 What's the dead center of it?

371
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
 That's verse 16.

372
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,420
 And what it says in verse 16 is that Asaph went into the

373
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
 sanctuary of God.

374
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 That's what changed his perspective.

375
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,420
 That's what solved his disappointment.

376
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,420
 He got close to God.

377
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,420
 Psalm 97 says...

378
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:57,420
 Just take that into consideration.

379
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
 The mountains melt like wax.

380
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,420
 Like Everest in all of its glory and greatness.

381
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,420
 Melts away the minute God shows up.

382
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,420
 Like the transcendence of God.

383
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,420
 It waxes away our greatest disappointments.

384
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,420
 This is what Asaph learns.

385
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,420
 He learns that God's presence, it brings new perspective.

386
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,420
 Like his disappointments, they had hypnotized him into

387
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,420
 thinking all hope is lost.

388
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,420
 And the minute he gets close to God, he snaps out of it.

389
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,420
 He realizes it's not as bad as I thought.

390
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,420
 Things are not as grim as they seemed.

391
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,420
 Because with God what you learn is that the realization of what

392
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,420
 you want pales in comparison to the reminder of what you

393
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,420
 already have.

394
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,420
 The realization, the attainment, the achievement of what you

395
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,420
 want, it pales in comparison to the reminder of what you

396
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
 already have.

397
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,420
 Namely who you already have.

398
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
 Like this is what Asaph does.

399
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
 He looks forward.

400
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
 He considers the future.

401
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,420
 Verse 17 says...

402
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
 That's a long ways out.

403
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,420
 He starts thinking about how all of this plays out in eternity.

404
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
 And you know what it gives him?

405
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,420
 The minute he adopts an eternal perspective, it gives him

406
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
 clarity.

407
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
 It gives him clarity.

408
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
 Clarity specifically about those he envies.

409
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 That they're set in slippery places.

410
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
 That unless they come to know God, they will fall to ruin.

411
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,420
 And then it's gone.

412
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
 The next.

413
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,420
 And he also gets clarity about the condition of his own heart.

414
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,420
 He realizes and honestly admits...

415
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
 When my soul was in bitter.

416
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,420
 When it was.

417
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,420
 Past tense.

418
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
 When I was pricked in heart.

419
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
 I was brutish.

420
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,420
 And ignorant.

421
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,420
 I was like a beast towards you.

422
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
 Asaph acknowledges.

423
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
 I was ignorant.

424
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
 I was like a beast.

425
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
 I didn't understand.

426
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,420
 I thought that fulfillment was found in all of these other

427
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,420
 places.

428
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,420
 I thought it was found in my job and in my relationship.

429
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,420
 And in my family being healthy with one another.

430
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,420
 I thought it was going to be found in a vibrant community

431
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
 here at Watermark.

432
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,420
 And yet what I learned is fulfillment is not found in any

433
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,420
 of those things.

434
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,420
 It's found in you, God.

435
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,420
 Fulfillment is found in you.

436
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 Friends, in the same way that Asaph,

437
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,420
 he uses an eternal perspective to deconstruct his

438
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
 disappointment.

439
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
 We have to do the same thing.

440
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,420
 Like we have to get underneath our disappointment and

441
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,420
 understand, man, why does this bother me so much?

442
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,420
 And how can I be restored to hope?

443
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,420
 That way I can find fulfillment.

444
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,420
 And the way you do it is you lock your eyes on God.

445
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
 You fix your gaze on him.

446
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,420
 Just like Davy said.

447
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
 You look to Jesus.

448
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,420
 You get your eyes locked upon his goodness.

449
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,420
 And you allow that to inform the way that you see the watching

450
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
 world.

451
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,420
 Lamentations 3, 37-38, it tells us why this is valuable.

452
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,420
 Why when we look to God he can be trusted.

453
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
 It says...

454
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:15,420
 So friends, to the disappointment you feel because

455
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,420
 you're not as far along as you want to be in life.

456
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,420
 An eternal perspective would look at that and say,

457
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,420
 my God is good.

458
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,420
 And his plans are in fact better for my life than my own.

459
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,420
 Like to the disappointment you feel because it keeps feeling

460
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,420
 like God is unnecessarily complicating your life.

461
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,420
 An eternal perspective looks at that and says,

462
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,420
 my God is kind.

463
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,420
 And with him my pain is never pointless.

464
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,420
 But always has purpose.

465
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,420
 And to the disappointment you feel because the world has led

466
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,420
 you to believe you're not enough.

467
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,420
 You're not pretty enough, smart enough, funny enough,

468
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,420
 popular enough, likeable enough, desirable enough.

469
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,420
 You'll never be successful enough.

470
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,420
 To all of that, an eternal perspective says,

471
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
 my God is perfect.

472
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,420
 And I'm nothing less than he wants me to be today.

473
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,420
 I'm exactly who and exactly where he wants me to be.

474
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,420
 I'm exactly who and exactly where he wants me right now.

475
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
 We're going to move forward.

476
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
 We're going to get better.

477
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
 But that happens as I walk with him.

478
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,420
 Not because the world tells me so.

479
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,420
 Listen, if God is withholding some things from you,

480
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,420
 it's because he wants something else for you.

481
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,420
 If God is withholding some things from you,

482
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,420
 it's because he wants something different for you.

483
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:46,420
 Namely, more of himself.

484
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:54,420
 I guarantee you, he always wants more of himself for you.

485
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
 This is the story of the scriptures.

486
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
 This is what the entire Bible is pointing to.

487
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,420
 God wanting to be close, near and known by us.

488
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,420
 He will always work for that.

489
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,420
 And that's exactly what Asaph finds.

490
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,420
 As you keep reading, it says in verse 23...

491
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,420
 Asaph gets close to God and his perspective changes.

492
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,420
 It shifts.

493
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,420
 And what he finds is that God is continually with him.

494
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
 Holding him by his right hand.

495
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,420
 Guiding him with counsel and ready to receive him into glory.

496
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,420
 You see, even when Asaph had lost sight of God,

497
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
 God never lost sight of him.

498
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,420
 Even when Asaph walked away and moved towards the world,

499
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,420
 God stayed exactly where he was last left.

500
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,420
 The same is true for you.

501
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,420
 God has not walked away from you.

502
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,420
 God has not abandoned you.

503
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
 He's not overlooked you.

504
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
 He's not forgotten about you.

505
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,420
 And some of you feel like the exception to that rule tonight.

506
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,420
 And yet that could not be further from the truth.

507
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,420
 God, he sees you as you are.

508
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:28,420
 And he's wanting you exactly as you are tonight.

509
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,420
 This is the Lord's heart.

510
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,420
 Asaph comes back and he says, God, you're still here.

511
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
 You never left.

512
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
 I thought you forgot about me.

513
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
 But God, you didn't.

514
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
 You stayed here the entire time.

515
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,420
 I walked off and I got distracted by the world.

516
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:50,420
 I allowed the strength of my heart and my portion to be fulfilled by other things in life.

517
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,420
 Like I thought the strength of my job would fulfill me, God.

518
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
 But it didn't.

519
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,420
 I thought the strength of my relationship would fulfill me.

520
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,420
 I thought the strength of my good reputation would fulfill me.

521
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
 But God, none of those things did.

522
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
 You're my portion.

523
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
 You're my portion.

524
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,420
 Not just today and not just tomorrow and not just the day after that or the week following, the month after that.

525
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,420
 You're my portion forever.

526
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,420
 You never left me, God.

527
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:26,420
 Which is why I now know that I depend on you for the fulfillment I seek.

528
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
 And that's the third point.

529
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:35,420
 If you want to find it, you must depend on God for the fulfillment you seek.

530
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:45,420
 You see, fulfillment in life is found through contentment in God.

531
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,420
 That's what Asaph is writing in Psalm 73.

532
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,420
 That's what he wants you to take away tonight.

533
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,420
 It's not something you achieve.

534
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,420
 It's something you receive from the Lord.

535
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,420
 Which I know really bothers some of us.

536
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,420
 Like we were talking as a staff earlier, but tell them what they need to do to get it.

537
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,420
 That's not how contentment works.

538
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,420
 That's not what you do.

539
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:15,420
 Contentment is a satisfaction not in doing for the Lord but in being with the Lord.

540
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,420
 It's in registering not what I don't have but in what I do.

541
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,420
 That God, you're all I need.

542
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,420
 And so I can wait with you.

543
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,420
 I can sit with you.

544
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,420
 I can listen to you.

545
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,420
 I can come close to you, God.

546
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,420
 You see, the reason why I think that bothers us so much is because we've mistaken what fulfillment actually is.

547
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:50,420
 You see, when we talk about searching for fulfillment, often what I think we're looking for is something full of feeling.

548
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,420
 We've mistaken fulfillment as something full of feeling.

549
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,420
 And that's not what it is.

550
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,420
 Like we think that, man, I've got to find something that's going to gratify and satisfy every need in my life.

551
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,420
 And so what we do is we start looking for ways to achieve that end.

552
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,420
 We want a nicer job.

553
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
 We want better friends.

554
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
 We want another beer.

555
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,420
 We decide that we need to take another trip.

556
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
 Like we do all of these things.

557
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
 And here's the thing that's so tricky about it.

558
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,420
 This is what the enemy loves to do in our life.

559
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,420
 He loves to scratch the itch.

560
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,420
 So that way you come back for more.

561
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,420
 He wants you to find some sense of satisfaction.

562
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,420
 But once it wears away, return like a dog to its vomit.

563
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,420
 This is what the enemy wants.

564
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,420
 And yet what the Lord wants is he wants to satisfy you not just today but forever.

565
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,420
 And this is God's heart.

566
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,420
 You see, Paul, he talks about this in Philippians 4.

567
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,420
 He says, I know what it is to be in need.

568
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,420
 Like I know what it is to have plenty.

569
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:06,420
 Like he's saying I know what it's like to be empty inside and I know what it's like to be full inside physically.

570
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,420
 I've learned a secret of being content in any and every situation.

571
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
 Whether I'm well fed or I'm hungry.

572
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
 Both ends of the spectrum.

573
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
 Whether I'm living in plenty or I'm living in want.

574
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,420
 Paul says that finding fulfillment is like learning a secret.

575
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,420
 And the secret is that fulfillment is found through contentment in God.

576
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
 That's what he's pointing towards.

577
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,420
 Psalm 34.

578
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:38,420
 It says the young lions, which sound like young adults, they suffer want and hunger.

579
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,420
 We want for so much.

580
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:46,420
 But those who seek the Lord, they lack no good thing.

581
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:58,420
 Translation, those who seek the Lord, those who are content with God are always fulfilled.

582
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,420
 Friends, this has been heavy.

583
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:10,420
 But I didn't want to pull punches because I love you enough to speak what needs to be spoken.

584
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,420
 We are all looking for fulfillment in here.

585
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
 We outed ourselves at the beginning of this night.

586
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
 If you're like, it doesn't apply to me.

587
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
 Sorry, it does.

588
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,420
 You admitted at the beginning of this thing that this talk is for you.

589
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,420
 And yet I love you enough to say this.

590
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,420
 And I prayed earlier, God, should I?

591
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:40,420
 And I think it's right for me to say that if fulfillment is found through contentment in God.

592
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:50,420
 You are never more unfulfilled than you are tonight if you do not know Jesus.

593
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:56,420
 Some of you are searching the world.

594
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,420
 You're trying to find it.

595
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:05,420
 And yet what you need to know is fulfillment can't be found.

596
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:13,420
 Because fulfillment found you.

597
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,420
 Because Jesus Christ is God.

598
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:25,420
 Colossians 1.19 tells us...

599
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,420
 Jesus Christ is not only God, he also forgives sins.

600
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:40,420
 John 1.16 says...

601
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,420
 But he's not only God and not only capable of forgiving sin.

602
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
 He also gives life.

603
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:59,420
 Which is what it says in John 10.10...

604
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,420
 You need to know that you are not only seeking the fullness of God, you are seeking the fullness of the fullness of God.

605
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,420
 Friend, are you seeking for fulfillment tonight?

606
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:14,420
 Then you need to know fulfillment has already sought after you.

607
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:24,420
 You walked in here tonight no doubt frustrated, discontent, dissatisfied with your job, with your relationship, with whatever it may be.

608
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,420
 You fill in the blank.

609
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:38,420
 But the truth you need to hear is the resolution of that problem will only leave you searching still.

610
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:52,420
 But the one that has resolved our greatest problem, our separation from God, he will fulfill you forever more.

611
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,420
 Do you know him?

612
00:32:55,420 --> 00:33:03,420
 If you don't, then the fulfillment you seek is waiting in him.

613
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:09,420
 If you do, then I would ask you the question...

614
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:15,420
 Are you living life or are you living it to the full?

615
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:28,420
 Because Jesus has not just come to save you from your sin, he has come to save you for so much more.

616
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,420
 Friends, Jesus is wanting for you.

617
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,420
 That's what this all says.

618
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,420
 The question is, how much of him do you want for yourself?

619
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,420
 Let me pray for us.

620
00:33:45,420 --> 00:34:12,420
 (Praying)

621
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:21,420
 Father, there is no life apart from you.

622
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,420
 And there is no life worth living apart from you.

623
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:38,420
 You God have come to give us life, but you've also come God to give us the fullness thereof.

624
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,420
 I pray God we would know that this evening.

625
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:50,420
 But not just know it intellectually God.

626
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,420
 But know it God deep into our bones.

627
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,420
 Feel it God instinctively from within.

628
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:09,420
 And let it drive us God to pursue an intimacy with you forever.

629
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:18,420
 God I know what it's like to search the world and come up empty.

630
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:27,420
 I've run God that direction and I've found it to be so fruitless.

631
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:36,420
 Would you God by your spirit tonight speak to each and every one of us God in the way that only you can God.

632
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,420
 The way that you so distinctly can.

633
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:46,420
 Would you speak to us and say life is not found out there, it's found right here.

634
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,420
 You will not find joy elsewhere.

635
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,420
 You'll find joy right here.

636
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,420
 Come to me, come to me, come home to me.

637
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:04,420
 I've never left you, I've never lost you, I've never forsaken you, I've waited for you all along.

638
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,420
 Come back to me God.

639
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,420
 I pray we would respond to that call tonight.

640
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,420
 Believer and those that do not believe God.

641
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:22,420
 I pray like let this evening God be one where we awaken to the reality that there is no life that is fulfilling apart from you God.

642
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:29,420
 No, in fact, we've never lived more unfulfilled than when we're apart from you God.

643
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:40,420
 And so quicken our feet, incline our hearts, inspire God our souls and draw us back to the one thing that matters.

644
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,420
 It's you God.

645
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:49,420
 It's you like you've come God to save us from sin but to new life.

646
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,420
 You God, you're the one that gives a life and a life worth living.

647
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:04,420
 Fulfillment is nowhere else to be found but only found right here.

648
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:15,420
 Friends, if you're in the room tonight and you do not know Jesus Christ,

649
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:22,420
 with just a loving urgency, I want to look at you and say,

650
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:29,420
 everything you're searching for, it's found in him and him alone.

651
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:36,420
 If you want to place your faith in Jesus, if you want to declare him as Lord of your life and receive the free gift of salvation,

652
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:44,420
 that gift which saves you from your sin and your eternal separation from God but brings you close to the source of life,

653
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,420
 all you have to do is receive it.

654
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
 That's the beauty of the good news.

655
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,420
 It's a gift.

656
00:37:53,420 --> 00:38:02,420
 For others of us here tonight, we may hear this and it may feel like old news.

657
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:09,420
 But I want to remind you it's still good news.

658
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,420
 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, God.

659
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,420
 And let me burst forth, God, in the praise that you deserve.

660
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:26,420
 Father, we give these next moments to you and we pray, use them as you may.

661
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,420
 It's in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

662
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:39,420
