[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:32.500]   >> Good evening, Dallas.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.520]   And hey to our friends in Fort Worth as well down in Houston.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480]   And the rest of around the country and even around the globe as you guys tune in.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.320]   It's so fun to be together, gathered around God's word tonight.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   I'm gonna start with a little bit of a shameless update.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.600]   So I'm gonna be married in three weeks.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.800]   I'm really excited about that.
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.720]   >> [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.120]   >> Man, thank you guys for
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.440]   celebrating that like that.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040]   I thought it was gonna kind of be an eye roll, like, man, here he comes.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440]   Now he's gonna tell us how hot she is and all that.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.680]   I'm not gonna make that stop.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.320]   She is starable, I promise.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.720]   But anyway, that's not where I'm going.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.280]   As, that was stare-able, not terrible.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.520]   So anyway, when a relationship begins,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.240]   it's usually based on the similarities that you have.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.000]   And you kind of have that first time, maybe it's first date, maybe it's fourth,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.200]   fifth, or sixth.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320]   But there's that moment where it's like you have the me too moment, or
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.520]   you have several me too dates.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.880]   It's like, me too, me too, me too, let me guess, you too.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.080]   Me too, and it's just me too, me too, me too.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.000]   And then as the time progresses, and you get to know each other a little more.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Now we're close to the wedding date, so we've dated for nearly a year, and
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.760]   well, six months of dating, six months of engagement,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.320]   gonna get married in a few weeks.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.840]   And as we, too fast for some of you guys, man, what happened?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.200]   >> [LAUGH] >> Man, so I talked to our community
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.720]   group and our parents, I promise.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.040]   So anyway, but as the wedding date gets closer,
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.480]   we have learned more and more about our differences.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.840]   We are so different.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.280]   There are just, and there's like morally neutral stuff.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.960]   It's not like wrong, it's just different things that we discover about each other.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.120]   Different ways that we spend our leisure time.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.600]   Different ways that we connect with God.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.960]   Different ways that we spend money, namely I do, too much,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.640]   without looking or thinking.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.200]   And different ways that we think, different ways that we communicate.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.840]   There's just more and more differences that the me too phase could have never
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.160]   foreseen.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.520]   And here's the thing about a difference.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.640]   Anytime a difference approaches you, you can see it, and
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.040]   you've got a choice at that point.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.640]   You can either have a discussion, or you can have a division.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.920]   Those are pretty much your two options.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.040]   So anytime a difference comes at you, you've got a little fork in the road.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160]   You can have a discussion, or you can have a division.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.000]   You can go through it, or it can go through you.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.920]   Those are the two options that you have whenever a difference comes your way.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   And so tonight, we're gonna talk about how to deal with differences.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.320]   Dealing with our differences.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.840]   But I don't mean in a relationship context.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.560]   I mean in a human being, societal, earth-wide, city-wide context.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.520]   Because it would seem that we are not excellent at dealing with our differences,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.560]   and the world is one huge bag of differences.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.400]   Would you agree?
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.760]   Here's some that I just came up with off the top of my head.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.400]   I didn't look up diversity.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.200]   I didn't Google anything.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.800]   I just started thinking, and I came up with different belief systems,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.080]   upbringing, skin color, appearance, race, ethnicity, nationality,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.760]   gender, political affiliation, tax bracket, income level, sexual views, age,
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.400]   marital status, education level, entertainment choices, religions, and
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.080]   a bunch of other things.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.520]   So that's what I came up with just thinking, and you could think of more.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.440]   Somebody in here's like, you left me out.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.240]   But we could go up and down the rows, and you couldn't even make it one row before
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.720]   you met somebody who is very different than you, even if just in upbringing.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.680]   Right?
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   We are one big roomful, rooms full, world full of differences.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.120]   And the unfortunate thing is, is we do not seem to be good at dealing with them.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.600]   So you could remember recent news posts.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.120]   There's high racial tensions in the region, in the nation,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.280]   because of differences.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.520]   Simple reason.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.800]   Differences, complex pain, complex fallout, but simple reason why.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.440]   It's because we haven't handled our differences well.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.920]   Some of us personally carry pain as an individual because of the way someone
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.440]   handled a difference poorly.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.000]   And it might have been from years ago.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.720]   It's like somebody you don't even remember.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.440]   And it was something that you wouldn't even allow someone as an adult now to
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.800]   separate themselves from you on the basis of.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.520]   But for some reason, there was some person that harmed you because of the way you
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.280]   looked or the way you appeared or the way you talked.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.400]   Or something like that.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.960]   And they did not handle their difference well with you.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.560]   And that's left an imprint on you and the way that you think.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.520]   Some of us carry anger because people in history,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.760]   people that we've never even met before,
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.800]   people in history have failed to handle their differences well.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.680]   They handle them poorly, famously poorly.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.120]   And some of us carry hurt because two people, namely a mom and a dad,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.880]   were not able to handle their differences and make them reconcilable.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.720]   It is imperative that we deal with our differences.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.640]   When you notice a difference with someone, you can do one of two things.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   You can discuss or you can divide.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   And the church has always been a place.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.160]   I'm gonna say this again.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.600]   The church has always been a place for discussion and not division.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.320]   And so tonight we're gonna continue that work.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.840]   Because like a married couple getting ready for the road ahead,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.920]   if we don't, as human beings, learn to share this place called earth together,
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   in a better way, the results will be catastrophic.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.120]   They will continue to be what they've been.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.600]   And we will see entire communities of people separate from one another
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.720]   because of the same headline, irreconcilable differences.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.360]   And so if there are Christians in the equation,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.760]   if there are people who claim the name of Christ in the conversation,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.000]   that's actually not an option.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.560]   And so what we're gonna do tonight is we're gonna look for a method
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   on how to handle differences.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.920]   So I can't go into all of the sociological complexities
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.600]   of all the categories that I just named.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.960]   There's no way we could cover that.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.400]   We couldn't even cover one of them.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.040]   But what we can do is we can look to Jesus Christ for a method,
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.280]   a way of thinking that's transferable to any kind of difference
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.560]   that puts a fork in your road.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.840]   Any kind of difference that you meet.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   And so we'll go to John chapter four to talk through that with Jesus
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.720]   and let him see and his company see the example that he is there.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.520]   So John chapter four, if you recognize that,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.320]   that is actually a famous story for a different reason.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.080]   It's because there was a certain woman, a well-known woman.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   It was the woman at the well.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.680]   And so the woman at the well became famous because she had a broken past
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.560]   and she came thirsty physically and Jesus came with a solution
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.360]   to fix her spiritual thirst forever,
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.120]   which transferred all the way over to her village.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.760]   And so that's why the woman at the well became famous.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.800]   But what we're going to do tonight is we're going to focus
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.160]   on this little narrow slice of the story,
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   this one little part of John chapter four.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.560]   And it's the way that Jesus and this woman handle their differences.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.920]   And so if you love John chapter four,
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.000]   because of the woman at the well getting that living water,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.880]   you're going to get to see that,
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.600]   but we're kind of going to pass by it a little bit more quickly tonight,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.160]   because what we're going to do is we're going to examine closely
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.960]   the way Jesus handled those that he is radically different with,
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   different from, I should say.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.320]   So we'll start in John chapter four, verse four.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.160]   Here we go.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.720]   Now, Jesus had to pass through Samaria.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.240]   So that's a different region.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.160]   Jacob's well, which Jacob's well was put there.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   Jacob is like the old Testament figure.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.320]   So 2000 years prior, Jacob lived,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.120]   he dug a hole in the ground and that's verse six
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.320]   and Jacob's well was still there.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.640]   So this is a very old well where people went to get water.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.120]   So Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey,
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.880]   Jesus is fully man and fully God, Jesus gets tired.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.080]   So wearied as he was from his journey was sitting beside the well.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.120]   It was about the sixth hour, which means high noon.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.320]   So this is Texas, August.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.680]   This is Middle East, high noon.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.640]   We understand each other.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.640]   Verse seven, a woman from Samaria came to draw water.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.680]   So picture Jesus sitting beside a hole in the ground
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.720]   that was highly celebrated
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.280]   because of who it had belonged to 2000 years prior.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.120]   And then this woman comes along at high noon.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.080]   Now, you've got to know why they were so different
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.840]   because that's what brings tension to the story.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.920]   So they've got a few differences.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.440]   I'm gonna give them to you before they start to talk.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.120]   I want to pause here and tell you how they were different.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.760]   Number one, race.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   So Samaria used to be part of Israel,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.000]   but they were conquered by a foreign nation
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.320]   hundreds of years prior and produced a region,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.760]   a nation of people who were half Jewish.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.520]   Now, I don't know if you know your Bible well,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.880]   but at this point in time, there is no half Jewish.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.000]   In the Jewish mindset, there's like Jew
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.360]   and then there's everybody else.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.560]   And so there was no almost, there was no close enough.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.400]   At this point in history,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.320]   the racial lines were very, very clearly drawn
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.200]   and the Samaritans were just not included.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.320]   In fact, it was an insult to be called a Samaritan.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.080]   But one time Jesus was in an argument
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.560]   with the religious leaders and they said,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.040]   "Isn't it true that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.560]   And so that's like a first century insult.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.920]   It didn't really pop to us.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.440]   But that would have stung.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.000]   To be called a Samaritan was an insult.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   People actually went around Samaria.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.120]   It said Jesus had to pass through Samaria.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.480]   Now, whether that was the quickest way
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.400]   or whether that was the plan of God or both, I'm not sure.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.520]   But I know that this was a region that was walked around.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   It would be like, if you need to take off from Dallas
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   and walk to Fort Worth and you had to walk around Arlington,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.840]   it's like, I just won't go there.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.680]   I refuse.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.240]   You guys aren't from Arlington.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.280]   So people went to great length
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.960]   to avoid even going to that place.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.800]   Secondly, they had a religious difference.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.040]   So Israel had a special place in the plan of God.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.480]   God himself founded the nation of Israel.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.840]   And it had a special purpose.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.560]   It was to save, at one point in the future,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.600]   was to save the entire world by opening a way back to God.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.160]   That's Jesus Christ.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.720]   Jesus, God founded the nation of Israel
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.200]   with the goal of launching an entire movement
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.880]   from which would come one man
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   that would save the whole world.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.600]   So the nation of Israel had a special priority place
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.160]   in God's plan and they knew it.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.320]   And the Samaritans were considered the worst
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.160]   of the everybody else.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.860]   And then thirdly, gender.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.700]   So men literally ignored women in this culture.
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.680]   And by ignored, I mean like you don't see them,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.680]   like you don't speak to them.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.480]   And so here, if you've ever felt like,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   man, I feel, I feel like I'm ignored because of my woman.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.920]   In this context, you didn't just feel like it,
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.760]   that was reality.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.040]   Your word wasn't permissible in court.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.480]   It is an embarrassing level of separation.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.360]   And so they've got all that working against them now.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.760]   Okay, so there Jesus is sitting beside the well,
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.180]   he's tired and here comes a Samaritan woman
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.460]   and the awkwardness of all the history
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.440]   just weighs down on them.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.920]   And Jesus starts the conversation by saying,
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.660]   give me a drink, which I love.
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.080]   That would be as if, picture in the 1960s,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.640]   like right in the heat of all of the civil rights movement,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.280]   a white person and a black person come
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.880]   to the same public water fountain
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.920]   and they just look at each other.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.400]   And then somebody says, you know what?
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.480]   Let's share a cup.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.560]   That's the way Jesus starts this conversation,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.000]   except the dividing lines are even more broad
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.100]   than they were for us in the 60s.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.180]   They wouldn't even share land, Jews and Samaritans,
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.100]   let alone a water bottle.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.100]   But that's what Jesus starts with.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.500]   He says, give me a drink.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.060]   For his disciples had gone away in the city to buy food.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.140]   The Samaritan woman, whose name we never know, said to him,
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.140]   she just drags the, I love this,
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.260]   she just drags the awkwardness
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.420]   like right into the middle of the room.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.060]   She has no pretense, she has no tact.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.460]   She just says, how is it that you, a Jew,
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.580]   in case you forgot, ask for a drink from me, a woman?
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.980]   From Samaria.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.260]   And then, they're so different,
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.220]   she just can't get away from it.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.740]   And the narrator even gets in on the deal.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.380]   So your Bible probably has parentheses right there
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.580]   that says, for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.920]   [congregation laughing]
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.740]   This is the first really good idea that we see in the text
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.540]   when it comes to dealing with our differences.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.740]   And it actually doesn't come from Jesus,
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.660]   though he models it later.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.760]   It's this, point one, don't dismiss differences.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.500]   Don't dismiss them.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.000]   Don't ignore them.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.340]   A positive way to say that would be to say,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:45.540]   acknowledge them.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.460]   Don't dismiss differences.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.260]   She just says, hey, I'm not sure if you noticed,
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.340]   but I'm a woman and you're Jewish.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.700]   So we can just kill the elephant in the room,
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.140]   we can kill the awkwardness, and then we can move on.
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.980]   The narrator does the same.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.580]   Hey, parentheses, these people don't deal with each other.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.900]   That is a really simple first step for us,
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.000]   but it is so crucial.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:09.220]   Just say the obvious out loud, please.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:15.220]   You cannot reconcile differences if you ignore them.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.260]   That is impossible.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   There's no such thing as a reconciled and ignored difference.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.320]   That does not exist.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.140]   And we fall into this so easy.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.340]   Some people, some of us will go,
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.860]   particularly white people, will go so far.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.800]   I'm going there.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.140]   So we'll go so,
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.500]   somebody's nervous, like, please don't do this.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.300]   You will go so far and so long
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.340]   without just saying someone else's ethnicity
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.160]   who's not white.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.660]   It's like you're describing every other attribute.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.380]   It's like, you'll talk about what their height is,
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.940]   you'll talk about what their weight is,
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.500]   you're down to their dietary habits
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.660]   and where they've been in the word,
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.940]   and you just will not say, yeah, he's Mexican.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.740]   Some of you are nervous right now because you're like,
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.260]   isn't he supposed to say Hispanic?
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.240]   He's from Mexico.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.600]   You can say that.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.120]   Don't dismiss differences.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.960]   This happened last week.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.400]   Last week before the porch,
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.920]   I'm in Fort Worth every single Tuesday
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.640]   where people are actually over in the Ridgewood Theater
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.160]   right now gathering, doing this very same thing.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.600]   And before the porch last week,
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.280]   we were training some new volunteers.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.100]   So we were, I was in a small circle, probably 10 of us,
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.240]   and it struck me that someone from the group was missing.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.000]   There's like a seven-week training process,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.040]   and it's like week four.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.200]   And so I knew the group fairly well, but not really well.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.160]   And I could just sense that someone was missing.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.000]   And so we're like in the circle,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.760]   and I'm like, hey guys, who's missing?
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.440]   Everybody's like, oh man, somebody's missing.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.640]   Who is it?
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.780]   And we can't figure it out.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.880]   And then my friend Brittany says, oh, I know who it is.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.720]   She's got dark hair.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.320]   I was like, okay, dark hair, yeah.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.660]   Two thirds of the porch, got it.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.800]   And then she says, and she's short.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.040]   And I'm like, dark hair and short.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.480]   I don't know, I still don't know who it is.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.580]   She said, well, she's quiet too.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.080]   I'm like, oh, I still don't know who it is.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.320]   And then she like leans in and covers her mouth,
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.560]   and she says, she's Asian.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:18.480]   I said, I'm glad we kept that between us.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.000]   Don't want that getting out.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.560]   Hey Brittany, at least you spoke, well done.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.480]   Isn't this silly?
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.440]   Hey, I just want to tell you something.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.600]   You can't be friends with people you're afraid of.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.520]   You can't do that.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   You can't, it just gets silly.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.680]   Like we cannot have real camaraderie
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.880]   if we're scared of each other to that degree.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.480]   It just gets a little crazy.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.720]   Ignore differences, make for cheap camaraderie, okay?
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.040]   If you can't acknowledge someone else's ethnicity,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.360]   your trust is on E, okay?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.920]   Ignore differences, make for cheap friendship.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.700]   So don't dismiss differences.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.760]   All right, let's go back to the text.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.680]   Verse 10, John chapter four.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.520]   Keep an eye right here on this next section.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.880]   Keep an eye on the differences that this woman sees.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.200]   And I want you to see Jesus' unwillingness
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.680]   to let those differences divide them.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.600]   Keep an eye on that.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.040]   Jesus answered her, if you knew the gift of God
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.120]   and who it is that's saying to you, give me a drink,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   you would have asked him
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.120]   and he would have given you living water.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.680]   And so he comes up and says, hey, share a drink with me.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.040]   And she says, we're way too different for that.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.380]   And he says, hey, if you knew who I was,
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.780]   you would have asked me first.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.760]   I promise.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.960]   I'm here to give you water that will satisfy you forever.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.760]   Which is a little bit unusual.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.080]   Just so you get a picture of this.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.880]   This would be like walking out of like a grocery store
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.040]   and there's a guy, like a homeless guy,
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.600]   like sitting outside the door
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.080]   and he like swats you as you go by.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.080]   And he says, hey, what if I told you
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.360]   that I had food for you and you would never be hungry again?
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.280]   And you'd be like, what if I told you
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.360]   I'm calling the police?
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.600]   And so this is like a little bit strange and that's okay.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.960]   So Jesus is saying something a little bit strange.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.440]   She has no idea.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.040]   She has no idea that he's talking about a spiritual reality
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.400]   of living water, of soul satisfaction.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.280]   She does not know he's saying that.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.520]   So she's confused.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.080]   The woman said to him, sir,
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.200]   you have nothing to draw water with and the well is deep.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.560]   Where do you get that living water?
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.680]   And then here she comes and she's gonna be religiously
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.080]   and ethnically proud right here.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.760]   So if you wanna see ethnic pride, here it comes.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.600]   Are you greater than our father, Jacob?
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.720]   Highlight our, our father, Jacob.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.800]   Are you greater than him?
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.640]   He gave us this well.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.480]   You hear that?
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.120]   He gave us this well.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.800]   And he drank from it himself
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   as did his sons and his livestock.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.120]   So there's another divide.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.120]   Jesus will not let them be divided.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.800]   Jesus said to her, everyone who drinks of Jacob's water
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.480]   is going to be thirsty again.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.600]   You notice how you come here every day,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.560]   but the water that I give you will never be thirsty,
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.920]   will make us sure that you are never thirsty again.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.920]   End of 14.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.840]   The water that I will give you
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.040]   will become in you a spring of water,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.120]   welling up to eternal life.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.040]   I will give you water.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.080]   It's not liquid.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.160]   It is spirit and it will never stop.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.960]   It will satisfy you from now.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.160]   It starts right this minute
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.680]   and it will never go away ever, ever,
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.980]   not even an earthly death.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   And she finally starts to come around,
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.740]   but there's one little difference that she's carrying
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.240]   that she is even afraid to bring up.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.680]   And that's the fact that, if you know the rest of the story,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.800]   she's been divorced five times
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.080]   and she's living with her boyfriend at the moment.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.200]   Now, if that doesn't win you social favor here,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   it really didn't at this time.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.340]   That's where she is.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:51.000]   And so Jesus, unwilling to be divided
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.320]   because of their differences,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.440]   exposes and acknowledges the difference.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.000]   He won't let it be dismissed.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.120]   Jesus said to her, "Okay, you want the living water?
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.280]   "Go call your husband."
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.940]   And the woman answered him, "I have no husband."
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.840]   Which is kind of a conversation in her, right?
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.000]   It's like a half truth.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.160]   It's like, "Hey, go call your husband.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.680]   "If you want the living water, I'm sure he does too.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.520]   "Why don't you bring him?"
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.480]   And she's like, "Oh, no husband, fresh out."
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:21.200]   And then Jesus is not toying with her.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.160]   Like, he's not playing with her.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   He's not trying to make her feel ashamed.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.480]   He's trying to give her life.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.680]   And he knows that life goes through the differences.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.460]   And so he says, "You're right in saying,
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.340]   "I have no husband.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.540]   "You've had five.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.560]   "And the one you now have is not your husband.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.600]   "What you said is true."
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.500]   He is trying to show her love and life
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.220]   and satisfy her soul by satisfying everything that she needs.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.140]   And she is bent at this point.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.320]   She did it right the first time.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.520]   She acknowledged the difference,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.800]   but now she is letting the acknowledged difference
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.720]   divide them.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.160]   She is not wanting to allow Jesus
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.020]   to go where he wants to go.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.240]   But Jesus would not have it.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.500]   So the second point is this,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.640]   right after Jesus' model in the previous nine verses,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.600]   don't let differences divide us.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.960]   Do not let differences divide us.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.280]   Differences can divide us.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.560]   You can discuss them or they can divide you.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.380]   They do not have to divide you.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.220]   Look at all the...
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.520]   She's gonna run through these divisions
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.600]   that she was willing to stop for.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.920]   I'm a man, you're a woman.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.820]   Jesus is like, "That's not a problem today.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.400]   "That's not gonna divide us anymore.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   "I'm a Samaritan, you're a Jewess.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:30.800]   "That's not gonna divide us today.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.580]   "Hey, the water well, the water well's ours.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.420]   "It's not yours."
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.460]   Jesus says, "Okay, you wanna talk water?
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.120]   "Let's talk water, real water, living water,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.940]   "satisfying to your soul, water.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.240]   "It's not gonna divide us today.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.440]   "I've been divorced five times.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.920]   "How could that come up?
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.880]   "It's not gonna divide me from you.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.480]   "I'm after you."
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.740]   He is relentless, Jesus is.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.260]   He will not allow himself to be dissuaded by your past.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.060]   He won't allow himself to be dissuaded by your ethnicity.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.960]   There is nothing about you, your gender, your job,
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.740]   your upbringing, your cultural belief.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.140]   There is no condition that can make Jesus get cold feet
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.940]   when it comes to his pursuit of you.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.980]   Don't let differences divide us
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.100]   'cause that's not what Jesus does with us.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.340]   Unfortunately, we're not good at this either
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.520]   because when we see differences,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.260]   we start to make assumptions.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.060]   And assumptions have the ability to divide.
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.740]   Here, I'll run a little experiment.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.500]   You can pick on me.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.540]   So if I told you right now that when I was in junior high,
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.620]   I lived in deep East Texas down a dirt road
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.880]   in a trailer house and my stepdad was a truck driver.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:41.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.900]   Would you make assumptions?
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.260]   What if I told you at that very same time,
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.920]   I had a fade haircut
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.120]   and I wore all white Air Force Ones to school
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.540]   and I had an affinity for 90s rap music
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.580]   and I had a poster of Aaliyah on my wall?
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.300]   This does not feel like a safe place, guys.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.140]   What's happening?
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.520]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.900]   That's all true.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.140]   Every bit of that's true.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.860]   That's a fact, all of it.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.540]   Did you get caught assuming?
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.940]   Careful.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.940]   Don't let differences cause assumption.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.020]   Don't let them cause division.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.420]   You don't know who you're dealing with
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.180]   till you know who you're dealing with.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.480]   Don't let differences divide us.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.900]   We're gonna go back to the text one more time
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.660]   and I want you to watch really, really closely
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.360]   what Jesus does in this next part.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.120]   Don't miss this.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.700]   Verse 19.
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.240]   The woman said to him,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.720]   "Sir," which is the most obvious statement of the chapter,
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.860]   "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet."
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.220]   And so what better time
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.860]   to pick another religious fight with you?
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.760]   Here she comes.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.600]   Verse 20.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.420]   She's laying it on thick.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.900]   "Our fathers, our fathers worshiped on this mountain."
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.060]   So now she's got geography thrown in there.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.340]   "But you," that's a plural you, that means you guys.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.860]   "But you people say that in Jerusalem
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.780]   "is the place where people ought to worship."
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.860]   You see that ethnic, culturally-based priority
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.780]   she's got going?
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.340]   And Jesus said to her, don't miss this,
[00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.620]   "Woman," he leaves the distinction alone.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.780]   He's not gonna try to change her gender.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.740]   He created her gender,
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.100]   so he's not gonna get rid of that.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.580]   "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.560]   "when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.060]   "will you worship the Father."
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.420]   To which she probably would have thought, what do you mean?
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.020]   Not on this mountain nor there?
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.060]   Everybody knows that either here or there.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.900]   Those are the only argument points in the conversation.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.100]   Where else would we go?
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.340]   He says, "You worship what you don't know,
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.920]   "but we worship what we know for salvations from the Jews."
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.460]   So Jesus is not shy about doing number one,
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.420]   which is don't dismiss the differences.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:55.820]   So he's not afraid to do that.
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.260]   He knows she's Samaritan, he knows he's Jewish.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.100]   He knows that she's woman and she knows that he's man,
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.220]   and he does not blur the distinction.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.180]   But he's getting ready to say
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:07.620]   that the distinction might be reality,
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.720]   but it is not priority.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.340]   Verse 23, "The hour is coming."
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.780]   By the way, as if I could build this up anymore,
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.420]   this is the most profound word I have ever found
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.940]   in the scriptures about race and gender
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.500]   and differences in general
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.420]   and how they relate to our relationship with God.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.360]   The number one verse that I can think of.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.420]   "But the hour is coming and is now here
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   "when true worshipers will worship the Father."
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.260]   In Jerusalem, no.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.480]   In Samaria, no.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.340]   "In spirit and truth."
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:49.020]   There is a transcendent way to connect with God.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.580]   There is a way to connect with God
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:54.820]   that goes above and past whatever your skin color
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.980]   or gender or past or geographic location
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.540]   or politics or anything.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.140]   There's a new way to connect with God,
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.820]   and it's not location or culturally conditioned.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.220]   In spirit and in truth.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.420]   "For the Father," listen to this, why?
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.520]   'Cause God's looking for people like that.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.340]   "The Father is seeking such people to worship him."
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.380]   God is spirit.
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.900]   God's not Samaritan or Jewish.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.780]   God is spirit.
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.100]   He has no ethnicity.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.260]   He created them all.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.340]   They've all got value,
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.820]   every single one of them, just as they are,
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.020]   but he doesn't have one.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.620]   God is spirit.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.860]   "And those who worship him,
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.860]   therefore you must worship in spirit and truth."
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.260]   Now, don't miss this.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.740]   Jesus is not saying,
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.420]   "If you're gonna worship God, you can't be you."
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:52.540]   He's saying, "If you're gonna worship God,
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.900]   you can't be about you anymore."
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.580]   The ethnic distinction, the ethnic pride is out.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.180]   So he looks at this woman right in the face and he says,
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.980]   "Hey, here's what you already wanna hear.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.980]   Anti-Samaritanism is out,
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.300]   but you gotta go a step further.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.540]   Samaritan pride is out."
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:15.820]   There is no distinction that can hinder you
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.780]   from worshiping God,
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.500]   and there's no ethnicity that will help you worship God
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.060]   any more than any other, spirit and truth.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.540]   It's not about Jewishness, non-Jewishness.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.660]   It's not about gender anymore.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.260]   It's not about who's divorced and who's not.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.180]   It's not about who's slept with someone and who hasn't.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.100]   There is a higher priority now.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.860]   And so are you ready, woman at the well,
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.420]   are you ready to stop thinking like a Samaritan
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.220]   and start thinking like a Christian?
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.100]   So my third point, and before I say it, let me say this.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.820]   If you don't worship Christ
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.580]   more than your own distinctions and differences,
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.340]   you will stumble over this next point, predictably.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.260]   If you don't love Jesus Christ
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.100]   and the simple designation of being a Christian the most,
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.140]   more than anything else that makes you you,
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.620]   more than all the things about you that make mama proud,
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.940]   more than anything else about you
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.580]   that you have or wanna be,
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.660]   if you don't love Christ more than that,
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.580]   you will stumble over this next point.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.260]   Don't let our differences define us.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.220]   Don't let differences define us.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.820]   What I mean by that is don't let the distinctions,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.220]   which are good and have value,
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.220]   don't let them be your definition.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.300]   Don't let them be your highest identity.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.700]   Don't let your own differences
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.580]   and the things that comprise who you are
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.500]   take priority over loving Christ,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.260]   or you're not worshiping in spirit and truth anymore.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.380]   What starts to happen is you start to make Jesus
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.460]   in your mind look a little bit more like you.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.860]   And when you worship a Jesus that looks like you,
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.340]   who you really worshiping, not Jesus, you.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:57.860]   You've got to lay down what you're really worshiping.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.260]   You've got to lay down the distinctions that make you you,
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.940]   not because you got to get rid of them,
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.780]   but because you got to value Christ so much by comparison
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.300]   that they seem like they're nothing to you.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   That's what Paul meant when he said,
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.500]   "I compare everything a loss compared to knowing Christ."
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:17.420]   And so you will always, I want you to hear me very clearly.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.780]   You will always have certain distinctions and differences
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.500]   that make you you.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.300]   And there are many ways to divide up the world
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.580]   from your clothing size to your tax bracket.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.860]   Some of them are God made and some of them are man made.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.260]   And when you become a Christian,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.140]   you keep all of them except sin, you're still you,
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.260]   but you're not about you anymore.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.500]   Spirit and truth that rises above,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.980]   it rises above your cultural conditioning
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.060]   and it rises above the kind of face you see
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.540]   when you look in the mirror.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.300]   And so like, I don't know what this would look like for you,
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.980]   but like there's a host of identities that we all have.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.660]   There's a host of differences or distinctions.
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.420]   I'm using all those words to mean the same thing right now.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.940]   There's a whole host of attributes and traits that you have.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.220]   And if you are not ready to line them all up and say,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.540]   "Those are garbage compared to just the simple designation
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.620]   of Christian.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.460]   Those are nothing to me compared to simply
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.940]   being a Christ follower."
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.100]   You are not yet worshiping in spirit and truth.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.220]   And so here, I'll just do mine.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:28.260]   Here are a few, male, Texan, American, Southerner,
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:32.140]   white, Aggie, church staffer, fiance, husband real soon.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.220]   All that sounds really great.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.420]   I think God created all that, even Aggie.
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.940]   And so I think God, I'm just kidding.
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.140]   Don't let me lose you.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.660]   I'm just kidding.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.020]   I think God creates all that.
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.540]   I think man creates some of that.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.260]   And I think to worship in spirit and truth,
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.640]   I don't have to stop having that.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.900]   I gotta stop worshiping that.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.660]   That can't be who I am and who I'm about.
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.300]   It's a matter of priority.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.700]   And so all of the things that make you, you,
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.940]   they might, maybe you are black, maybe you are Asian,
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.300]   maybe you are middle Eastern, maybe you're middle class.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.340]   I don't know what you are.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.100]   I don't know the things that make you, you,
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.900]   but my guess is you could list them all out.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.580]   And here's what Jesus is trying to tell you loud and clear.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.380]   Those things may be reality,
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.020]   but they are just not priority anymore.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.940]   And so if any one of the things about you
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.380]   could be a role that you have,
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.060]   could be a personality trait that you have or want,
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.260]   but if anything about you and your conception of yourself
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.660]   comes higher than simply being connected to God
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:35.620]   through spirit and truth,
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.020]   you are not yet with Jesus
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.780]   where he is right now in this text.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.380]   So maybe it's not even your ethnicity.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.220]   It could be your job.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.980]   Maybe you love the designation executive,
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.260]   doctor, lawyer.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:50.660]   Maybe a role that you have or want, wife, husband.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.460]   You know?
[00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.620]   Oh Lord, if anyone regards me,
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:56.780]   let it be as a wife one day or as a husband.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.420]   Paul didn't say that, 1 Corinthians 4, 1.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.180]   If anyone regards me, let it be as a servant of Christ.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.700]   Maybe it's a personality trait.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.540]   I don't know.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.220]   Fun, successful, beautiful, hardworking, smart, driven.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.220]   If anyone regards me,
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.660]   let everybody know that I am ambitious.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.580]   If that is on the throne of your heart,
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.480]   you do not know what it is to worship in spirit and truth.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.220]   If there is anything about you that you have or want
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.980]   more than just Christ,
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.700]   you are not worshiping in spirit and truth.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.020]   You are playing a game called this mountain or that mountain
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.060]   just like this woman.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.340]   Maybe it's a reputation, self-made man.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.060]   I wanna be a self-made man.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.940]   Well, what's wrong with that?
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.220]   Nothing, as long as it comes second to being a Christian.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.140]   What other kind of man would you wanna be?
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.700]   How about independent woman?
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.300]   You're like, oh, don't go there.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.860]   What, hey, hang on, I'm serious.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.820]   What other kind of woman would you wanna be?
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.660]   Would you wanna be weak and dependent?
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.500]   No.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.280]   I'm not saying you lose it.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.620]   I'm saying it loses priority.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.740]   Do you see that?
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.540]   Christ is more than that to you.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.040]   You love Christ more than that ideal.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.540]   You love Christ more than that persona.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.540]   And let me tell you why this counts.
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.740]   You may be like, hey, what does this have to do
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.580]   with deal with differences?
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.400]   Now you're talking about me.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.240]   Let me tell you why.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.740]   Because as long as you love something about you
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.020]   more than you love Christ,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.440]   you can't love people who aren't like you.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.780]   You have no ability to love people
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.460]   if you are in a love affair with your own traits,
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:29.580]   whether it be the way you look
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.140]   or whether it be anything from height, weight, appearance,
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:35.060]   skin color, money, some fraternity that you're a part of
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.260]   or an employer that you're a part of.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.700]   If you love one of your traits more than you love Christ,
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.300]   you can't love somebody who doesn't have that trait.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.780]   It is impossible.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.100]   It is impossible to love with a love from heaven
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.740]   if you are obsessed with the particulars of earth.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.380]   There is no way that you can do that.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.820]   It is impossible.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.660]   And people will not understand it.
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.500]   I promise.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.900]   I know there are people in here right now
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.860]   that don't understand it.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.660]   And I am telling you, when they look at you,
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.860]   when someone misunderstands,
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.340]   and maybe it's a family member,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.740]   and they tell you that blood runs thicker than water,
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.220]   I can tell you from John four
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.720]   that blood does not run thicker than living water.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.940]   Nothing does.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.100]   Nothing brings people together.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.420]   Nothing can bring someone together
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.540]   like the banner of Christ.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.260]   And we will not gather under it
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:27.120]   if another banner is competing for our affections.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.740]   It will be impossible for us to love people
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.540]   who aren't like us.
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:34.860]   If we love something about us more than we love Christ,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.500]   there's no way to love one another
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.300]   if you're in love with just the one.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.500]   There's no way.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:48.060]   And so Jesus looks this woman right in the face.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.720]   And he says, listen, you're still you.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.140]   You didn't lose your ethnicity today.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.340]   You'll always be a woman and a Samaritan.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.300]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.140]   It has value.
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.660]   Remember, I created it.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.480]   Don't be more politically correct than God.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.400]   I created you as you are.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.860]   That is who you are.
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:12.780]   I am asking you to fall out of love with that above me
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.860]   and worship God in spirit and truth
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.300]   because God is seeking people like that.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.340]   And she believed him, guys.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.500]   She believed him.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.220]   And people in that village believed him.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.260]   They bought it.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.540]   They decided, you know what?
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.340]   This is always gonna be a Samaritan region,
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.700]   at least as long as we're around.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.660]   And we're always gonna be Samaritan people.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.780]   And the people who are men are gonna be men.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:32.980]   The people who are women are gonna be women.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.180]   And people who have positive personality traits
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.020]   are gonna always have those.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   And some people who have their jobs
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:37.860]   are gonna keep their jobs.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:39.480]   And other people who have their jobs are gonna leave them.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.660]   But no matter what our distinctions are,
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:44.820]   what we are gonna do is we're gonna let the priority be
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.620]   the God who does not have a distinction.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.060]   And so this mountain or that mountain is over.
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.200]   And people are in heaven today, today,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.460]   because they were able to hear with this woman
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.000]   that it no longer matters what your ethnicity is.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.580]   Not because God didn't make it
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.580]   and not because it's not beautiful the way you are,
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.140]   but because it is not the object of your worship
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.660]   at this point, only Christ, only Christ.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:14.160]   I'll close by sharing this with you.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.620]   I'm about to pledge my life to a woman,
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   I told you in three weeks.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.220]   And I did not tell you purposefully, but she is black.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.360]   Jamaican to be exact.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.740]   Black did not get a woot, but Jamaican did.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.340]   So. [audience laughing]
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.700]   This is the least politically correct night
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.580]   at the porch history.
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.420]   All right.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.560]   [audience laughing]
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.160]   So anyway, I'm gonna marry her in three weeks
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.760]   and I'm so excited about that.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.840]   And that difference is not one we found out down the road.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.440]   We knew that one right at the start.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.780]   [audience laughing]
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:55.740]   So I brought it up, I mean, the first few dates,
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.940]   not because of race or any difference at all,
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.580]   but the first few dates, it was kind of a,
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.920]   get to know each other
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.980]   and it hadn't really like taken off at this point.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.460]   But about the sixth date, not about,
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.060]   I know when it was, it was the sixth date.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.000]   The sixth date, we sit down and I brought it up
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.500]   and I said, "Hey, we've got this difference
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   and I don't know if you'd noticed, but
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.740]   [audience laughing]
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.740]   you like lattes and I like cappuccinos
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.300]   and I don't see how this deal is gonna work."
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.180]   [audience laughing]
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.440]   We started to talk about race
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.940]   and I wish I could tell you the particulars
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.020]   of that conversation to make it more interesting for you.
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.580]   But I know this, we talked for a good while,
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.260]   just at a restaurant, sitting down,
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.880]   about halfway through the meal, we start talking about this.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.620]   And I asked her some questions
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.800]   about how she felt about this in our relationship
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.100]   and just to explore her heart a little bit myself.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.740]   And it was obvious to me,
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.240]   after about half an hour of being with her,
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.140]   that she didn't care about anything that she was
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.380]   except being a Christian.
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.440]   Like there is one priority, Christ.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.740]   That was it, that was on the throne of her heart.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.580]   It was obvious.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.020]   She didn't say it in those words.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.380]   I don't even remember the exact words she said,
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.320]   but I know exactly what she communicated to me.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.920]   And it wasn't 'cause I was looking
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.720]   and it wasn't 'cause I talked first.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.220]   She loved being a believer in Christ
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.500]   more than anything else.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:24.300]   And that is the day that it became a pursuit for us.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.960]   I held her hand for the first time that night.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.980]   I was certain that she wanted to be a believer in Christ,
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.200]   just simply known by that.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.580]   If anyone regards me, let it be as a servant of Christ.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.040]   And guys, she had plenty.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.440]   Here's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.320]   She had plenty of distinctions that she could boast about.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   There was plenty of attributes and traits
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.460]   and things about her, her differences.
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.280]   They didn't define her.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.060]   Don't let our differences define us.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.500]   She didn't do that.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.820]   And she could have, guys, successful, well-connected,
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.160]   beautiful, strong black woman, for sure.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.360]   But that was not her boast.
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.940]   Do you see that?
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.140]   Christian was who she was.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.100]   And it became a relationship for us that night
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.640]   and very soon thereafter.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.840]   She borrowed my attention and she has not given it back.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.940]   Because when people come together,
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.280]   when people come together
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.120]   underneath a banner of Christ first and nothing else,
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.180]   all of a sudden you'll be shocked
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.120]   where you had the same agenda
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.880]   with people that you never thought.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.560]   I never thought.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.820]   I never thought that that would happen for me.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.460]   And I didn't proactively force.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.500]   You're like, "Oh, it was the Air Force One's thing."
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.340]   It was not.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.600]   Like, I didn't, like.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.640]   It was not that.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.300]   Like, I didn't grow up thinking,
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.200]   like, I really, really would like an interracial marriage.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.740]   I always knew I was open to it.
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.120]   But I didn't want to marry anybody
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:49.140]   who wasn't completely devoted to Christ.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.280]   That's the priority.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.380]   An interracial marriage is not gonna keep me warm at night.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.420]   We're not gonna be in some big fight.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.720]   And I'm like, "Well, she's got a great complexion."
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:01.520]   You gotta be devoted to Christ.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.300]   That's what's attractive.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.400]   That's what wanted.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.700]   All right?
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.260]   That's the only thing.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.540]   I never, I never asked her on an additional date
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.760]   because I hoped my Christmas card
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.140]   would look like a Target ad.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.980]   And I hope it does.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.180]   I'm serious.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.880]   I hope it does to the glory of God.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.720]   I hope it does.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:27.780]   And I've got a whole new host of questions
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.880]   I gotta answer and probably ask forgiveness for.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.420]   She's watching over in Fort Worth.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.020]   But I wanna tell you this.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.520]   When you decide that the things that make you you
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.160]   are no longer gonna run your agenda,
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.400]   and when something goes wrong,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.060]   you aren't gonna run to any banner other than the church.
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.660]   When you see some racism break out
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.040]   or some sexism break out,
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.980]   you don't need to run to your earthly camp.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:53.780]   You need to run to the church.
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.220]   Because we can't love each other.
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.640]   The love that's from heaven,
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.240]   if we are obsessed with the particulars of earth
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.560]   that God's given us and that have value,
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.160]   they just don't have top value.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:11.100]   And so if you're ready to worship God in spirit and truth,
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.360]   that will involve not denying who you are
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.400]   because God made you who you are,
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.860]   but adopting a new top priority
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.900]   and a new first designation
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.260]   and a new first identity, just Christian.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.200]   Jesus, only Jesus.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.860]   Let me pray for us.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:41.940]   Father in heaven, will you please,
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.540]   will you please just do a little bit of the work tonight?
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.240]   There is so much work that this planet needs in this area
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.920]   because we are in love with the way you made us
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.520]   instead of in love with you.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.680]   And so God, will you do just a little bit
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.520]   of the work tonight, God?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.920]   Will you do a little bit of the work
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.820]   that you did in that village in Samaria
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.060]   where you told people,
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.720]   "It is no longer this mountain or that mountain
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.300]   "or this job or that job or this gender or that gender,
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.200]   "but it is simply about spirit and truth
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.960]   "that governs it all."
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.700]   And so God in heaven,
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.940]   will you please allow that in these cities?
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.880]   Will you please allow that in this country?
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.380]   Will you allow the identity Christ follower
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.080]   to be first in our heart,
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.720]   not because we're in denial
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.320]   and not because we wanna lose the gifts you gave us,
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.820]   but because compared to you,
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.620]   there's no gift that's as good as the giver.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   That includes our distinctions.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:42.360]   Give us, God, a presence
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.560]   to give a simple pursuit towards you,
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.840]   made simple because we have laid down
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.000]   every other thing that we could possibly boast in.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.500]   And we've said with Paul,
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.640]   "Far be it from me to boast in anything
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.140]   "except the cross of Christ."
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.140]   And we can say with him,
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.840]   "If anyone regards us,
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.420]   "let it be as servants of Christ,
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.720]   "not by any other banner or no other name."
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:10.160]   Give us that grace, God, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:10.960]   Amen.
