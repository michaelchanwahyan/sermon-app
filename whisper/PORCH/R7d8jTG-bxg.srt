00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 [Heartbeat]

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I love it. So intense. If you weren't stressed before that, you are now.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Welcome, friends in the room. Welcome, friends in Fort Worth. Welcome, friends in Houston.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm going to start us off by reading a psalm that will give us some direction for where we're going as we continue this series X-Hail.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 So it's Psalm 139. It'll be up on the screens. If you have a Bible, you can flip there.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm going to read it, pray, and then we will dive into it together.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So here's what it says. For the director of music, a psalm of David.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 You have searched me, Lord, and you know me. You know when I sit and when I rise.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 You perceive my thoughts from afar. You discern my going out and my lying down.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 You are familiar with all my ways. Before a word is on my tongue, you, Lord, know it completely.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Where can I go from your spirit, or where can I flee from your presence?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 If I go up to the heavens, you're there. If I make my bed in the depths, you are there.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 If I rise on the wings of the dawn and I settle in the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, and your right hand will hold me fast.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me," even the darkness will not be dark to you.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 The night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 For you created my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother's womb.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful. I know that full well.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed body.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 How precious to me are your thoughts, God. How vast is the sum of them.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 When I wake, I'm still with you.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 If only, God, you would slay the wicked.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty. They speak of you with evil intent.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Your adversaries misuse your name.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I have nothing but hatred for them. I count them my enemies.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Search me, God, and know my heart. Test me and know my anxious thoughts.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 See if there is any offensive way in me and lead me in the way everlasting, we pray.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Father, I pray for the next 30 minutes that we're gonna have together.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And I pray that you would use them and use your word to allow all of us to leave here more in love with you,

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 more aware of your nearness, more able to exhale in a world that seems like it's falling apart.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I pray for my friends who came in this room tonight, and they are filled with just anxiety, uncertainty, frustration, pain,

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 that you would be more real to them than all of those things, than all the distracting things.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Father, we love you, and we thank you most of all for Jesus.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Thank you for the words penned by David that tell us so much about you, how you feel about us,

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 who we are, and how we can have a relationship with you.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I pray that we would leave here with a deeper understanding of that

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and a deeper relationship than we came in with.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 We love you, amen.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I don't know if you're in the room, and I won't have you raise your hand in this,

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 but you are in one of those early dating seasons.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Like, you're in the first date, second date, maybe third date.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Maybe you're sitting right next to each other right now, and you're on that second date.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 But I remember that season of dating, and oh, man, I feel for you so much, because that is the worst.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And here's why.

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 That early dating season where you're just getting to know, and hey, I'd like to take you to dinner,

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 and hey, I want to take you out, and you go on that first date, and maybe there's a second date going on.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And it's just that season where it's like one long perpetual interview.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 You know what I mean by that?

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 It's like you're both kind of getting to know each other, and everything is under the microscope.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So I was always hyper-aware of how am I being perceived right now,

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 because everything I'm going to do is going to be judged.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 They're going to evaluate, oh, he's this kind of person, or oh, she's this kind of person.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So you're in that state where you're just very aware.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I don't know if you can really even avoid this.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So you go out to dinner.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 You're even aware of what you're going to order off the menu,

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 because that's going to pigeonhole you into that kind of person.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 You're like, man, I'm trying to eat healthy right now, so I want to get a salad.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 But she's going to be like, he's a salad guy.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Oh, my gosh.

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Can't do that.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 So I'm like, hey, I'll take the steak and a bucket of gravy.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And that's just right, because I don't want to be pigeon as the salad guy, even if that's not here, not right now.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 It's not that I'm afraid to be known.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I just don't want to get known in kind of the wrong order.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 You'd have a wrong perception of me, or maybe you're a girl, and you're like, man, I really want the gravy and the steak.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And I feel like I have to get a salad right now.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 There's just all these -- even I remember like paying for things, and I felt like I couldn't pay.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Like I'd have like a gift card to some nice restaurant.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And it's like, of course, I work in ministry.

75
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 That's why we're going here.

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But I would give it, and I'd be like, I can't pay with the gift card, because then I'm like, the gift card.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 I just want you to know this cost me nothing to take you out.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 That's what this means to me, nothing or a coupon.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And then I'm like, hey, he's the coupon guy.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Oh, man, that's terrible.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 If you use coupons, that's great.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But it's just like you're underneath the microscope the entire time.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You're like all being judged.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And I just remember feeling that.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And it wasn't like necessarily you're trying to even deceive.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 You just don't want to be misunderstood.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 You don't want to be wrongfully pigeonholed into that type of person.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 You're this girl, that guy.

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 That's who they are.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And before they can really get to know you at the right pace or the pace of your choosing.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And eventually it even goes and plays itself out where I remember where we kind of established from my wife, for example, we started dating.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And it was like very much established.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Hey, we're in a relationship.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It was a mutual.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Hey, we like one another.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And I just remember feeling like, ah, but does she even really know me?

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Like she likes me.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 But does she even really know me?

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I mean, it's impossible to really love or like someone if you don't really know them to that degree.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And the reason I say that is because when it comes to our relationship with God, there's a part of us that in that same way where we're like always wondering, how does he feel about me?

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Does he even really know me?

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I've heard at the porch consistently.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 God loves you.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But does God really even know me?

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Like, could he really even love?

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Oh, man, I love you if you really fully knew me.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And the reason I even say that is because we're going to look at this song that we just read through where David is going to lay out that not only does God know you more fully than anyone else, but he loves you more fully than anyone else.

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And he not only gives us that, but he gives us how that is impacted and how that transforms David's life.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 That is a key to how David is experiencing transformation is how God sees him, how he knows how God views him, how God knows him despite all of his flaws and loves him and how that impacts David's life.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So we're going to pick it up.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Psalm 139.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 We're in this series, Exhale.

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 We're just exploring the Psalms and how inside of the Psalms, there's these different truths that God has preserved throughout the ages.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 The Book of Psalms was a songbook that was written by these different authors, primarily David, King David.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And in there, there's all these different truths that allow us in the midst of a world that's full of chaos and falling apart to experience an exhale.

116
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 The first week we talked about Psalm 46 and how God is in control, that everything is underneath God's control.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And last week, we talked about Psalm 23 and really laid out not only is he in control, but he cares for you.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 So tonight we're going to look at specifically and individually how God cares for you, how God knows you, how God loves you and talk about being known by God.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And David's going to lay out how that impacts his life.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Psalm 139.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 If you have never read it before, it is probably, if it's not the most famous, one of the most famous Psalms David ever wrote.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 In other words, if David, who was a musician, he's a song guy, he writes a lot of music.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 If he had an album, this would be fighting for the album cover.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Psalm 139, and this is one of his most famous songs of all time.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 So we're going to pick it up and David lays out how being known by God and knowing that God knows him has impacted his life and leads him to be changed.

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Here we go.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Verse one of Psalm 139.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 It'll be up on the screens.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 If you don't have a Bible, if you don't have a Bible, it is our gift to you in the Welcome Center.

130
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 There's one waiting for you to go pick it up.

131
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So grab that afterwards.

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Here we go.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Verse one.

134
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 You have searched me, Lord, and you know me.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 In other words, God, you know everything about me.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Who are you?

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I have been known and you fully understand all that I am.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Verse two.

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You know when I sit and when I rise.

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 You perceive my thoughts from afar.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 You discern my going out and my lying down.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 You are familiar with all of my ways.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Before a word is on my tongue, Lord, you know it completely.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 David says our first idea introduced in this text is that God knows you right now where you are.

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 You walked into this room.

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 God knows everything about you, David says.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And he's going to say how wonderful it's going to be or how wonderful this is, David's about to tell us.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 But he knows everything.

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He knows, David says, he knows the thoughts that you have right now.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 He knows every thought that you've ever had.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 He knows the words you're going to say before you even know you're going to say them.

152
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Whether you're an internal processor or an external processor like me who's kind of figured it out as I go, God's not figuring it out.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 He knows every single word, every single action, every single thing that you've done is fully known and fully seen by God.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 He knows what you did last night, last summer, the summer before that.

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 He knows everything about you and he's about to tell us the opposite reaction that most of us assume God would have if he really knows all of that.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 He's certainly going to pull away from me.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 If anyone, I mean one of the greatest fears we have is being known.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I'm afraid of being known despite that it's a huge desire.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 I'm afraid that in being known I'll be rejected.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And David says it is not rejection that we meet but something else.

161
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Verse 5, "You hem me in behind and before and you lay your hand upon me.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Such knowledge is too wonderful, too lofty for me to attain that God's reaction despite knowing everything about you is not to pull back."

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Immediately David says, "What do you do God? You know everything.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 You know what I think, you know what I want, you know why I want the things that I want.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 You know what I say, you know why I did that, you know what I've done, you know the thoughts that I've had, you know the number of people I've slept with.

166
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 You know the number of times that I've gotten drunk and I've made decisions I don't even remember but you know them.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 You know the decisions that I've made regarding money, you know the way that I look in the mirror and you know all the thoughts that I have.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Every insecurity, every feeling of pride God you know all of them.

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And your response to me is not recoiling or pulling back but it's moving in.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 You lay your hand upon me," David says.

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 God's response to you and knowing you fully is not to pull away but to move towards you, surrounds you, David says.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 That God is an expert on you and he loves you.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 In other words, God is the only being, the reason God can be the God who knows you better than anyone else and loves you more than anyone else is because he knows you more than anyone else.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 In other words, you can't love someone unless you know them.

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 If I was to have a friend or your best friend right now in the whole world and their name was Steve.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And Steve, your perception of Steve was one certain way like he had this job and he had an accent because he was from out of the country.

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 And all of a sudden you realize Steve's real name is Carl and it's all been a facade, it's all fake.

178
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Steve that you love, how tragic would that be?

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Steve that you love is not the, you never loved him.

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 You love some perception, some persona, you never knew him.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You cannot fully love someone unless you fully know them.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 God is the God who is there and when he looks at you he knows everything, David says.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And David is overwhelmed and overjoyed going, God you see everything about me.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And yet you don't pull away, you come and surround me, you love me.

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 That's when you look at me, how do you see me?

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 If you see me as your child whom you love and you don't abandon me despite knowing everything that I've ever done.

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 David establishes not only that I'm known but that I am loved.

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And he continues and really helps us understand how we can be confident that God knows everything about us.

189
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Here's what he says, verse 7.

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Where can I go from your spirit?

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Where can I flee from your presence?

192
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 How do I know that God knows everything about me?

193
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Because he's always with me.

194
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 David just says I can never escape you.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Everywhere that I go you are.

196
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And this isn't a cause for concern.

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 David is ecstatic throughout this whole thing.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Everywhere that I go you're with me.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 He says this, verse 8.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 If I go up to the heavens, I go up to the sky God you're there.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 If I go down to the depths of the earth and the lowest places, you're there.

202
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 If I rise on the wings of the dawn, which is just a creative way for saying the sun.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And I go to the very farthest place of the sea, I go from coast to coast.

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Or from the rising of the sun to the setting.

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Everywhere in between no matter where I go God, there you are.

206
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 You're with me, you're for me, you love me and you know me.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And you're there everywhere that I go.

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He says, I say surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me.

209
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Even the darkness will not be dark to you.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 The night will shine like the day for the darkness is as light with you.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 David says God is with you.

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 The second idea in this text, the second stanza in the song that David sings is that God is with him.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 God is with him.

214
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And God answers, man, one of humanity's greatest fears is I'm alone.

215
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Like you look up any study and they're going to say out of humanity's fears, the human experience,

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 what is one of our most common feelings and common concerns when I look out am I alone?

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And David writes this song, many people believe it.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 He wrote it at the end of his age and as he's looking back he says you've always been with me God.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Everywhere that I go, when you came here, you, when you drove here in the car, God was with you.

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 When you were doing that thing this past weekend that you're like filled with regret now from God was with you.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 When you were out on vacation, wherever you go, God is with you.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And David says when I look back on my life and here's what I know and I've learned over the years,

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I am not alone.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 The human experience and the fear that I will not and I've never been alone, you're with me.

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 When I was a shepherd, David would say out in the field, you were with me God.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 When I'm a good king, you're with me.

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 When I'm a bad king, you're with me.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 When I was a good husband, David would say, you were with me on good days, bad days,

229
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 God you're always there, you're always with me.

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 That I'm not alone.

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And the reason I think this wasn't a terror for David because I think a lot of us think it's like being on a like security camera constantly with God

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 and I think David would go, that's not a security camera.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 That causes me joy to know God no matter where I go, you're with me.

234
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And the reason is, is because David knew how amazing it was to have immediate access to God.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 In other words, if I was to ask you, hey, if you could have immediate access to anything in the world at any point in time, what would you want?

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 In other words, if I was like, hey, you can have any immediate access to anything in the world, what would you want?

237
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 You want a billion dollars at any point you can go, yeah, I've got a million dollars.

238
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 If you want influence at any point, you can go, man, I'm going to this interview.

239
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I want to have influence over finding favor in these people's eyes.

240
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 I want to have influence.

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 If you got to have anything, immediate access to that thing, what would you want?

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And David would say, I have what I want, God.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 I know the one and I have God always with me, immediate access to God.

244
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 He's the one who controls finances.

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 He's the one who controls influence.

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And at all times, I can't get away from you, God, you're with me always, you know me and you love me.

247
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 How amazing are you?

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 David just proclaims as he sings this song to himself and to his people.

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 God, you're with me.

250
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 How amazing are you, God?

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And you know me and you're with me.

252
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And he continues and not only tells us that, but he tells us something else at the center of why God knows you and what you should know about him as it relates to his relationship with you.

253
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 He says this, verse 13, for you created my inmost being, my soul.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 You knit me together in my mother's womb.

255
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

256
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Your works are wonderful, and I know that full well.

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place.

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, your eyes saw my unformed substance.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And David says, you were the one God, you made me.

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Not only do you know me, the reason that you love me so much is because you're the designer of me.

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 You fashioned me, you created me.

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Even inside of my mother's womb, it was you.

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 It was always you.

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And he says, I'm wonderfully made.

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 He picks up on how amazing your creation is.

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I used to think this was like such a funny thing for David to be like, look at me.

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I'm wonderfully made.

268
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Have you seen the statue?

269
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I'm amazing.

270
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And this humble brag that David gave, but he's just declaring really what all of science backs up.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 How amazing you are, that God formed and fashioned, and he uses the word knit you together inside of your mother's womb.

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 Our third idea from this stanza is God made you.

273
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 He loves you because God made you uniquely you.

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 That you weren't just some random act, some surprise, maybe to your parents, but you didn't surprise God.

275
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And he was the one behind knitting and forming you in your mother's womb.

276
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Some scars coming out.

277
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 It's true that he was the one knitting.

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And I love the expression because it's literally like someone weaving together inside of the mother's womb.

279
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 The Bible teaches how amazing the humanity and the world around us is unique in all of creation.

280
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That God didn't say, I'm going to make the lion in my image.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I'm going to make this bird, and I'm going to breathe breath into it.

282
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I'm going to uniquely create and knit together in the womb of every single alligator in the womb of that person.

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But he does to humanity, it's humanity that he says, I'll die for you.

284
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Regardless, and you may go, man, I don't love me.

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And there's one being who does.

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 He fashioned you, your personality, everything about you before you were even an idea in your parents' head.

287
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 He was the one forming and fastening.

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 That science, unlike science, that tells us that humanity, humans are one step above the apes.

289
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 The Bible teaches you are one step below the angels.

290
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And that's temporary.

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Even that will one day be changed.

292
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And humanity will assume a place where even the angels will be judged by mankind because they alone are made in his image.

293
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And David's declaring, God, you made me uniquely.

294
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 You saw me, God.

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I love this probably because we're having, we're like 35 weeks pregnant right now.

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And so we have a little baby boy.

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 In fact, you guys want to meet?

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I'll show you the little baby boy that we have in there.

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Jordan, if that's up there.

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Yeah, little alien inside of there.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 That's at 12 weeks.

302
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And I can't believe I'm that dad right now.

303
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Oh, my gosh.

304
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I'm like, hey, look at this picture.

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 You can't even tell what it is, but there he is.

306
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And I think why I love that so much is because the Bible teaches that right now, who is forming, who formed, who's knitting that child together, who knit you together.

307
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Who's behind creating a child is not just mother and dad.

308
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 It's not just the parents.

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And you may go, yeah, but they play a role in it.

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 The dad does the one thing that he thinks about all day long.

311
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And the mother is really kind of the host that carries it.

312
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And she carries the brunt of it.

313
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 But who's forming it?

314
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Like how amazing when science.

315
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I didn't know how to take this message if we should even go into all the scientific stuff.

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But the scientific research around the human body is so amazing.

317
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And God says, look, you're fearfully, you're wonderfully made.

318
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 It was me, always me weaving you together.

319
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 There's no mistake when you were inside of you, inside of your mother's womb.

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It was me.

321
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I was the one who took one cell.

322
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I mean, how amazing is the human body?

323
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Human bodies made up of 70 trillion cells right now, 70 trillion.

324
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And the second that I said that, 25,000 cells in your body were replaced.

325
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Right now, how amazing of a work of art you are.

326
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Those 70 trillion cells all came from two cells, one from your mom and one from your father.

327
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 23 chromosomes and 23 chromosomes.

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And they were brought together.

329
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And God was the one who united them and created you.

330
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And from them, they split and split and split into 70 trillion that make up your body right now.

331
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 God is the one, he says.

332
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And David says, look, when no one saw me.

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Like right now we go and we get a sonogram every once in a while to get to be able to see him.

334
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And it's really blurry.

335
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 It's like, is that a human?

336
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 God sees it.

337
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 God is the one that God says, no one else saw me, but God, you did.

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 You saw, you were the one weaving together.

339
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 You were the one creating and fashioning me.

340
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I praise you because you are the one behind creating all that I am.

341
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 The 54 million heartbeats that a baby has before it exits the womb.

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 God, you gave every one of them.

343
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 You sustained every one of them.

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 That's who you are.

345
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And he gives us one of the most interesting and incredible truths about God and the creation of humans.

346
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 David lays out inside of this Psalm.

347
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He lays out, I love this verse, that all of your days, all of the days for me were ordained for me and written in your book before one of them came to be.

348
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 That God, you knew, what did David just say?

349
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 That God looks down at your life and he said, before you even existed,

350
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 before you were even a fetus, an embryo, or even just like part of your parents mistake.

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Before any of that took place, I had this book and it was no mistake for me.

352
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I knew that you were coming.

353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And he says, I have a book that holds every single day that you live.

354
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Like in other words, inside of heaven, there's some, some way that we don't fully understand.

355
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 There's a book that's kept with Mary on it.

356
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 John on it.

357
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It has you inside of it and has every single day that you'll ever live.

358
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 God knows it, sees it in advance and he has it all inside of there.

359
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I mean, how lovesick, amazing in love with you, God is, he keeps everything about you inside of that book.

360
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And David is praising God.

361
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 God, you know, everything, not only that, before I was even around, you knew what I would do.

362
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 You know where I would go.

363
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 You know, everything about my heart, you see all of it and you still love me.

364
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I'm overwhelmed by this.

365
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And here's how it's further overwhelming for David.

366
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I mean, think about what David just wrote.

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 I don't know what you know about David.

368
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Not only did he kill a guy named Goliath, but David had a struggle with the ladies.

369
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And David was the guy who ended up sleeping with Bathsheba, who was out taking a bath on the roof.

370
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And David ended up murdering her husband.

371
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So inside of David's book, David just said, look out before I've done anything.

372
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You got this book.

373
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 You love me.

374
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 You know everything in advance.

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Despite knowing all of it, you still love me.

376
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You knew that inside of the book that I have, there's a chapter labeled murder.

377
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Inside of the book that I have, despite that there's a chapter labeled adultery, you didn't throw the book away.

378
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 You didn't get rid of it.

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You didn't get rid of me.

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 How rich in love you are, God, that you know everything about me.

381
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 And yet still you love me.

382
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 You see the depths of who I am, of who I'll be, of what I'll do.

383
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And yet still you love me.

384
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Not only do you love me.

385
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 He says this, how precious to me are your thoughts, oh God, concerning David.

386
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 How vast is the sum of them.

387
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So if your translation says, how precious are your thoughts and how vast are your thoughts concerning me.

388
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand.

389
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 When I awake, I'm still with you.

390
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 That David says, God, when you think about me, I mean, this is like, so I don't know why this took out.

391
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And I was like, David, that is a little bold.

392
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 You should back off a little bit.

393
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 He basically just said, God, you think about me all the time.

394
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Who's God?

395
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 God thinks about me all the time.

396
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 God's thinking about you all the time.

397
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 That's what he just said.

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 How vast, how amazing, how many are your thoughts?

399
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 If I was to count the thoughts, the way that God thinks about you.

400
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 In other words, you're always on God's mind.

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 When you're not thinking about God, he's thinking about you.

402
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 What kind of amazing, loving parent is this?

403
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 That he's always thinking of you.

404
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 How vast it'd be like picking up sand, David says.

405
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And trying to count out the little grains.

406
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 That's how much God is thinking about you.

407
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 He's like any parent.

408
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 If you have parents that, or anything like my mom.

409
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Where if you were to go over to my house in Houston, where she lives.

410
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And you were to come over.

411
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I remember when I was dating my wife, for example.

412
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And we would go over there.

413
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 She is the mom who's like, oh my gosh, this is my precious boy.

414
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 He can do nothing wrong.

415
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Immediately, third date in, she's like, let me show you him as a baby.

416
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Here's him doing potty training.

417
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Mom, I'm naked in that.

418
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 That's not okay.

419
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 She's the third date in.

420
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 You're ruining this for me.

421
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 No, it's amazing.

422
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Look how cute he is.

423
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 That's who she is.

424
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 She keeps a book.

425
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 She just loves.

426
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 She's crazy about her child.

427
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 In the same way, when God looks at you, David says.

428
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 All that you are, he knows.

429
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 All that you are, he loves.

430
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And there's parts of you that he's working to change.

431
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And make more look like Jesus.

432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 But all that you are, he sees new.

433
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And he loves.

434
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And then David takes a song and it really takes like a really weird twist here.

435
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 It goes from like in sync to slipknot where he's like, God, you're amazing.

436
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I love you.

437
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 I'm just so crazy about you.

438
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 God, you know me kill everybody.

439
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And it's like easy, David.

440
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Okay.

441
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 He said, if only you, if only you, God would slay the wicked away from me.

442
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You who are bloodthirsty.

443
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 They speak of you with evil intent.

444
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Your adversaries misuse your name.

445
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So David's going, God, you're amazing.

446
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 You know me.

447
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 You love me.

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 You form me.

449
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 You fashion me.

450
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 Despite every bad part of me.

451
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 You still love me.

452
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You still don't walk away from me.

453
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 God, will you kill ISIS already?

454
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Get rid of all of the bad guys.

455
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 God, anybody who's against you, I'm against.

456
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Here's what he says.

457
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord?

458
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And abhor those who are in rebellion against you.

459
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I have nothing but hatred for them.

460
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 I count them my enemies.

461
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I love it.

462
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 David is doing really.

463
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Oh, what's he doing?

464
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 There's just some love.

465
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Like he's a guy.

466
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 He's a, he's a feeler.

467
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 He's a poet.

468
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 He's emotional.

469
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 He's an emo.

470
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 He's just in love.

471
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And he's expressing himself on God.

472
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Look, you, I love you.

473
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 You love me.

474
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 This is amazing.

475
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I can't believe how God anyone who doesn't like you.

476
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I hate in this.

477
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Just like it's really not that dissimilar from like what I think most of us do when someone doesn't like something that we love.

478
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And God, David's just going, look, God, I love you.

479
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 If anyone has a problem with you, they get a problem with me.

480
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 We see this and you may be going, no, I never do that.

481
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 When people don't like the same sports team as you, you're like, I hate you.

482
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Like I'm an Aggie fan.

483
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And, uh, and it's really hard to be.

484
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 It's like an abusive relationship.

485
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 I feel like I'm in with the Aggies right now.

486
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And, uh, in, in that the, uh, the Aggies.

487
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 So if you came up and you're like, man, I hate the Aggies.

488
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I'm like, I hate you.

489
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 How about that?

490
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 That's probably too far.

491
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Pastor.

492
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Um, or, or if you were like with my wife and I love my wife and you were like, Hey, I hate your wife.

493
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Be like, first, what's wrong with you?

494
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Second off, I hate you.

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Anyone that comes against you.

496
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 David says, I hate, he's just expressing himself.

497
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 He's just in love.

498
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And he finishes off and we'll land the plane right after this.

499
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Verse 23, where he says, not only does God, I know that you have power over all the evil in the world.

500
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Anyone who's against you, God, I'm on your side.

501
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Take them out.

502
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And it snaps out of it.

503
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And he goes back into, uh, what seems like it fits more with the song.

504
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Here we go.

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Verse 23, search me, God, and know my heart.

506
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Test me and know my anxious thoughts.

507
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Here comes our exhale.

508
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 And I love David because I feel like I learn even how to pray when I read him.

509
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 What did he just say?

510
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Like he goes through this whole song.

511
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 God, you have searched me, God, you know me, you know where I've gone.

512
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 You know where I'll go before I was ever existing.

513
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 You knew everything about me, God.

514
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 How amazing yet you still love me.

515
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 You know, all those things, you know, God, you know, you're amazing.

516
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And then he finishes off and he goes back and he gives us this insight into David's heart and David's mind.

517
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 We're to search me, God, try me, see if there be any anxious thoughts.

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 No, my anxious thoughts.

519
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 What is it?

520
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 David, why does he need to know your anxious thoughts?

521
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 You just said, God knows everything that you think.

522
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 God knows everything that you feel.

523
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And David's going, look, God, I'm just inviting you.

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 It's as though he's telling himself, despite the fact that I know, you know, everything about me, God, I'm inviting you now.

525
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Know my anxious thoughts, God.

526
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 I know that, you know, but I'm inviting you and you know where I'm anxious and I'm inviting you into step in.

527
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I want to trust you.

528
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 You know that I'm worried right now about if I'll ever get married.

529
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 You know that I'm worried where you provide money.

530
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Will I be able to make rent?

531
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 You know that I'm worried about this job.

532
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Am I really moving in the right direction?

533
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 You know that I'm worried about these different circumstances, God.

534
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 And so I'm inviting you in.

535
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 I know that, you know, and it's as though David's rehearsing out loud this truth.

536
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I know, you know, you searched me, you know, everything, but God, I'm inviting you to know, well, you know what's going on in my life.

537
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I want to feel your nearness.

538
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 I want to know that, you know, what I'm facing as I look towards whatever anxious things await me or whatever is pressing in my life.

539
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 God, I just want to remind myself that, you know, that's all that I'm declaring.

540
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And I'm inviting you to know it more, and then it gives what is probably the most convicting part of this whole song, and maybe my favorite part of it.

541
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It says, "See if there be any offensive way in me, and will you lead me in the way everlasting."

542
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 See if there's anything offensive in me, God.

543
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 If there's anything that's not consistent with you, and will you change it?

544
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Will you allow me to become aware of it, and will you redirect my course and lead me in your path and your way that he does?

545
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And he says, "Look, God, I'm inviting you not only to know, and I want to know that you know what I'm facing, and I'll have peace because I know that you're with me, and you know you're not surprised about what's going on around me."

546
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 But not only that, God, I want to invite you in, and I want to invite and ask that you reveal to me if there's anything offensive, anything that goes against you.

547
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 And he takes really the opposite stance that most of us do when it comes to the dark things inside of us.

548
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Like, in other words, the sin struggles in my life are the dark parts of your heart.

549
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 The common human reaction when it comes to God is not to move towards him, which is what David does.

550
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 He moves away, or our common reaction is to move away, that we want to shrink back.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 It's those dark places, the "how can God love?" It's those things that cause me to go, "No, but you don't know what I've done."

552
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And David takes the exact opposite and says, "God, come into my life, God. Will you come and heal? Will you come and change?

553
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I'm moving. I'm not going to be afraid. I'm not going to shudder back. I want to expose, and I want you to come into my darkest places, the blackest places inside of my heart, God.

554
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 I know who you are. You're a God who's rich in love, who specializes in changing and healing people.

555
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I'm inviting you now," David says. "I'm not going to shrink back like most people do.

556
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 No, God, couldn't love me because I'm not a good enough person." David says, "I'm not a good person, God, and yet you love me. You know me.

557
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I'm coming to you. Will you heal me, Lord? Will you change the parts of me that don't look like your son, Jesus?

558
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Will you come into my life, and I'm moving towards you. I will not move back in fear.

559
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Perfect love is cast out fear, God, and I'm inviting you to come in.

560
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Where there's sin, will you come in? Where there's adultery in my life, come in.

561
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Where there's murder in my life, God, will you come in?"

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 David models for us, and why does he move towards God?

563
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 Why? I hope you get this. The reason he moves in is not because he feels the freedom to move towards God despite going,

564
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 "God, it's ugly. Will you change it? Will you make me more like you?

565
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Anything offending you, God, will you change it?"

566
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 The reason he does so is not because David is unique and he's the only one that gets to do that.

567
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 It's because David knew God, and David knew that God is a God who specializes in bringing life and healing into people.

568
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 The reason you and I recoil, and I believe this with all of my heart, mainly because the Bible teaches it,

569
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 from God in the midst of our sin, in the midst of our shame,

570
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 is because there's parts of us that don't believe God is really as good as the Bible says he is.

571
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 David says, "I know the God who is there. Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob.

572
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 He's a God who brings life from death. He's a God who changes hearts.

573
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I'm inviting you, God, into my life. Will you change the parts that don't conform?

574
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Anything that offends you, Lord, I'm inviting you. Come into my darkest places and change them."

575
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 I was so convicted, and I was both encouraged and convicted this week in reading this text.

576
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Because I have... God used it, I'll say it this way, to just expose my own blind spots.

577
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 There's just parts of my own heart that I'm going, "God, I just need you to come in and change. Will you change me?

578
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I don't want to live the rest of my life and be prideful and arrogant and selfish this weekend,

579
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 even remodeling this house or gut-renovating a home that we hope to move in someday."

580
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 I was in conflict over my wife about different stuff, and it wouldn't even make sense.

581
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I was like, "God, dude, explain the conflict. You would be confused."

582
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I'm still confused on how we got into that conflict.

583
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 But it was just... Honestly, it was just a reflection of how selfish and prideful and hurtful I am with my tongue.

584
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I want to change. I see the reaction. I'm around godly men all the time.

585
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 When they get into a situation where it's like, "Oh, man, this is about to go down."

586
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Their response is humility and kindness.

587
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 In the moment, I want it to be that, but I really don't want it to be that, because you're going down.

588
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 That's my initial response. I need to go, and I need God to come in.

589
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 God was just like, "These are places, David, that I want to change. I want to heal.

590
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 These are not right, and I want you, God. I'm inviting you. You're my only hope."

591
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 David would say, "And we should say."

592
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 What's going to change the dark places inside of your heart?

593
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Is it really just going to be more accountability, which is a great thing?

594
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 But as far as your heart, accountability can help bring healing in that.

595
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 But God, you're our only hope.

596
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 David would say, "God, will you come in? I'm going to expose to your people.

597
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 I'm going to expose the dark places in me.

598
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Then will you come in and help heal and restore? I know you can change what's dying and make it alive.

599
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Will you come in there?"

600
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 It happened again yesterday with another teammate where God was just like,

601
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 "Man, I guess you love me a lot, God, because you are really exposing some stuff in my heart."

602
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Yesterday, driving home, going, "God, will you search me? Will you change me?

603
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 I don't want to be a father like I am right now.

604
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 I don't want to be the same husband today or in 10 years that I am today.

605
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Will you make me more like Christ?

606
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 You're my only hope, God. Will you help me? Will you change me?

607
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 I'm inviting you in. Will you search me and know me?

608
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Will you lead me in a way everlasting?"

609
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I know that you're a God who specializes in taking what's sinful, what's broken,

610
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 in the darkest parts of our hearts, and you just breathe life and light into them.

611
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 We are renovating, like I said, this house, and I'll land the plane here.

612
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 In that house, it was so bad.

613
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 It was a foreclosed property that the last owner was just trying to make the next owner go through torture.

614
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Everything from the mold on every ceiling to raccoon poop everywhere.

615
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 It's like a raccoon colony in here.

616
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 There's rat stuff everywhere. It was just so bad.

617
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 We had to rip everything out, all the sheetrock everywhere in this house.

618
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 We're ripping it all out.

619
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Everything finally gets out of the home, and I look in the fireplace.

620
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 There's this fireplace, and it has this exposed nooks and crannies,

621
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 where you can see they took off the front brick to replace it with something cleaner and nicer.

622
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 I don't know what they're going to replace it with.

623
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Anyways, you can see inside the fireplace.

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I looked inside of them, and I saw very clearly with a flashlight.

625
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 I'm just looking around to see if there's dead bodies.

626
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I saw what looked like huge fossils, like a baby pterodactyl had died inside of this thing.

627
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Huge bones, totally fossilized.

628
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 It was like rib cage.

629
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Oh my gosh, that's a big femur.

630
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 I don't know what this was, but it was large.

631
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 I don't know if it's a possum or raccoon or small cat or what it was inside of there.

632
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 I pointed it out to the construction workers because I'm like, "Hey, you want to get rid of that?"

633
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 He laughed and was like, "Oh, yeah, okay."

634
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 That's my construction worker impression.

635
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 I kept checking. This was a couple of weeks ago.

636
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 I would go, and I'd check, and I'm like, "Oh, man, they still haven't removed it."

637
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 "You're going to get that, right? Okay, yeah, great."

638
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 They start putting up sheetrock.

639
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 A few more days go by, and I'm like, "Hey, it's still in there right now.

640
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Oh my gosh, it's staring back at me."

641
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 They don't do it, so I realize, "Man, I'm going to have to do this.

642
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I'm going to throw on the gloves. I'm going to be the one who goes in, and I'm going to take it out."

643
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 They may not care because they're like, "Look, it's just bones. Just put sheetrock over it."

644
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 But I care because I'm the owner, and I want to get anything dead and skeleton-like out of my house.

645
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 So I pull this thing out.

646
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 The reason I say that is because that's what God does.

647
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 That's truly the clearest way that I know.

648
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 He comes into our life, and he says, "Anything dead, I'm going to take it away.

649
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 I'm going to remove it. That's who I am.

650
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 I don't do it because I'm angry at you. I love you.

651
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 I'm the God who loves you, and I specialize in removing what's dead, not because I'm angry,

652
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 not because I won't love you if it doesn't get removed.

653
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 I do that because I love you. I'm going to remove that from your house."

654
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 You may have people in your life, just like construction workers, who are like,

655
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 "Oh, it's fine. Come on. Just leave the bones."

656
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 People are going to go all around your world.

657
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 It's confusingly celebrating just bizarre things.

658
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 We're like, "Look, you be you. Do whatever feels good to you.

659
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 Despite how much it hurts others around you, despite how much it hurts you, just be you."

660
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 God says, "Look, anything dead in your life, I'm not going to let continue to rest there.

661
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 I'm going to reach in. I'm a God who specializes in reaching out my hand.

662
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Will you just open and follow the example of David in Psalm 139?"

663
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 He says, "God, you know me, and you love me.

664
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 I'm inviting you in. Will you come and remove what's dead?

665
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 Will you come and remove what's dying?"

666
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 Some of you are here and back in church, maybe the first time in a while.

667
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 If you've never been to church, in some ways you're better off than so many of us.

668
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 For some reason, the church in our nation, and it's easy for the church in any nation,

669
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 to become a place where you don't do and follow the example of David.

670
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Where you walk in and you go, "Look, I'm not going to pretend.

671
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 I'm not going to play games. God, will you help me? I'm inviting you in.

672
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 I don't care who knows it. There is no fear. I'm going to come out, God.

673
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 Will you come and will you change me? I'm inviting you where there is sin, God.

674
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 I know grace abounds. Will you come in and change me?"

675
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 The church has never been intended, it's never been a place where you come in

676
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 and you play some game and you hide. We're all broken.

677
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 The chains are broken. I'm broken. JP is broken.

678
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 Everyone who's ever been on this stage, and God alone, you're a hope.

679
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 You're the one who can change us. You're changing us right now through the power of Christ.

680
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 And if you've never seen that power at work, that's what the church has always been intended to be.

681
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Not a place where we show up and we just play the game.

682
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Where we say, "God, will you come in and lead me in the way?

683
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 I know there's offensive ways in me. God, I don't know where else to turn.

684
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 Will you help me and will you heal me? And I know that's what you specialize in.

685
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 So I'm moving in faith towards you and I'm trusting.

686
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Because that's who you are, God." And David would say, "You know God."

687
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 If that's your response to him. Because he's the God who moves in

688
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 and where dead things are, he breathes life.

689
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And where those of us open up and are willing to say, "God, I acknowledge where I am.

690
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Will you help me? I want to be more like Christ. I want to know you more.

691
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Sometimes I don't even realize that's the beating desire of my heart.

692
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 Will you help me? Will you heal me?"

693
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And David would say, "That's the man or woman who's going to experience healing.

694
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 And going to experience an exhale in the life and the world around him.

695
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 As they become increasingly more like God."

696
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 That's honestly the message of the gospel, if you didn't know it.

697
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 And by gospel I mean good news. In other words, all of Christian faith

698
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 is built around something called the gospel.

699
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 It's the good news is what that word means.

700
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 The good news is that Jesus on the cross became sin.

701
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 That God, all that it means to become a Christian is to accept that Jesus on the cross paid for my sin.

702
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Everything you've ever done was nailed to Jesus.

703
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 Everything you've ever done wrong, everything that every thought you've ever had

704
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 was all paid for on the cross by the God who specializes in bringing life

705
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 where things are broken and dead.

706
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 And by just trusting in him, expressing faith, "I believe you paid for my sin, God.

707
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 I believe that when you rose again from the dead, the payment went through.

708
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 The check cleared. And it was enough.

709
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Even death could not hold the Savior of the world.

710
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 The Savior we pray that you know.

711
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 The Savior behind all that we do here and the Savior that brings life where dead things are."

712
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 I'm going to pray that he'd do that more and more now.

713
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 Father, we love you. We thank you for Jesus, our King.

714
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Thank you that you're a God who specializes in bringing life to dead things.

715
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 God, I mean it. Will you change my heart?

716
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 I have so many places that don't look like you, Lord.

717
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 And I want them to.

718
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 And I don't know where else to turn.

719
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 And my friends in this room who share that same heartbeat, make us more like Christ.

720
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Please, Lord, use your people, use your word, and just make us look like Jesus.

721
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 I pray for my friends who don't know you, that your spirit, the hounds of heaven itself,

722
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 would be after them now.

723
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And that they would come to faith and come to trust in that God,

724
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 and they'd accept the life that you offer them.

725
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And they would experience the replaced death that Jesus gives us on that cross,

726
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 dying in our place.

727
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 Lord, we love you. We thank you for our King.

728
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 And we worship him now, the one who made us, created us, before we were ever alive.

729
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 It's in his name we sing. Amen.
