1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What is joy, buddy?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I don't know.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 It's a dream!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 All right, PORCH, how are we doing tonight?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We doing okay?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Tripping over my words.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 It's so good to be here.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Glad that you're in the room with us this evening.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Some of you, it's a regular occurrence for you to be here with us on a Tuesday night.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Welcome back.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Thanks for always giving us your time.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 But for others of you, you're here for the very first time.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Maybe you knew you were coming to it.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You're like, "Man, you know what? I've had this marked on my calendar. I was ready to come.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I'm in town, and so I wanted to make a special appearance."

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Maybe your friend duped you into being here.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I don't know what brought you into the room tonight, but we're really glad you're here.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Not just those of you here in the room, but all of you tuning in online as well.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Thanks for joining in, and not just with the PORCH, but with what God is doing in the lives of young adults here in this ministry,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 both in Dallas, Texas, and all over the nation.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We believe that He can meet with anybody at any time and any place, and that includes you, wherever it is you are right now.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 A special shout-out to PORCH Live, Greater Lafayette, Fort Worth, and Scottsdale.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 We're really glad that you all are tuning in as well.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 PORCH, tonight we are continuing in our series, Joy, which has been a joy.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 We have loved this series. I don't know about you.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 It has been one of my favorites to work through by way of reading the text and then preaching it to you.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I think God is teaching me as He teaches you, which is always the hope.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And then along the way, what He's done is He's brought good friends into the mix of the conversation around this topic,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 one of which I am very excited for you to hear from tonight.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Because tonight we have not a special guest, but a dear friend in that Tyler Moffitt is going to be preaching to you tonight.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Here's why I say he's not a special guest.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Because he's now a part of the PORCH family, folks.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 He is our new Director of Discipleship here at the PORCH.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Would you put your hands together for Tyler Moffitt, please?

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And Tyler, you can go ahead and come on up.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I wanted Tyler to stand up here with me as I said this to you all.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Jesus says in John 13 that by this they will know you are my disciples, that if you have love for one another.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Tyler is, in my estimation, the embodiment of that verse.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 He's an amazing communicator. You're going to see that in a minute.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 He is an amazing counselor in meeting one-on-one with people.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 But man, when you just see the way that he interacts with friends to strangers,

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 he emits a love that is characteristically true of Christ himself.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So brother, welcome to the PORCH family.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 We're so glad to have you here.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Yes.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Thank you.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And here's what I want us to do.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I would love for us to pray for Tyler and his family, his wife Jen, his three little kids as they make their journey here to Dallas in just a few weeks.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And then we'll pray for what God's going to do over the course of the evening.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Okay, well let me pray for it.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 God, we are so grateful for the Moffat family, for the fact, God, that you've brought them to us.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Tyler and I were just visiting a moment ago, and I think, God, you gave these words because they're true.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Here right now, God, we stand at the center of answered prayer in the beginning of something really special.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 It's not because of anything Tyler brings, nor I bring, God, it's because you're a part of it.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And yet, God, what I have standing next to me is a very faithful man, a man, God, that wants to follow you, King Jesus, wherever it is you lead.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And I praise you that he has followed you here.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 God, we pray that you would be with them as they make their way to Dallas.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 We pray, God, that you would go before them and behind them, hymn them in on every side, and help them, God, to find home here, not just in our city, but amongst these people.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And then, God, I pray that you would speak through Tyler tonight to us.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And, Porch, I want to give you a chance to pray for yourself where you're sitting.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Would you pray and ask that God would speak to you tonight?

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And then, we want to humbly ask that you would pray for Tyler, that God would speak through him, and it would be God you hear.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Lord, we love you, and we thank you for Tyler, for these people, and for what you're about to do.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It's in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Give it up for Tyler one more time.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Man, well, I know we already did this, but you have to understand, for months I've been waiting to be here with you.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And so, I just want to ask one more time, Porch, how are we doing tonight?

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Come on.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Man, Kylan and I have just been dreaming and praying about this for a long time, and the fact that this is just a few weeks away is, I pinch myself crazy.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 And I was thinking, you know, but as we start, I've spoken here before a few months ago, but I wanted to introduce my family to you.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 They're still down in Houston where I'm coming from, and I was going to show a picture, but I thought the picture's just too cute and normal, and my family's not.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And so, I was thinking, what could I show you?

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And I thought, oh, I know exactly what it is.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So, a couple weeks ago, I'm driving home from work, and my family, so I've got a five-year-old, three-year-old, one-year-old, okay?

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And they're waiting outside to greet me, which is just the best, okay?

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And I'm driving in, and as I pull in, I roll down the window, and they start dancing.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And I was like, cool, unprompted.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So, I take out my phone.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I start videoing it, and then this happened.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Just watch this.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 [Video playing]

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 What?

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I'm like, Jen, what are you teaching these kids, you know, when I'm gone?

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 They're crazy.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 The reality is, man, we're excited, that crazy crew excited to be here among the family that's here.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 One big happy family in Dallas and around the country.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 We're excited to be here.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And the reality is I've been praying for you.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And even as I was driving up 45 today, just like, man, just thinking about, I know all of us we haven't met.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I was just thinking, God, what is it that you want to do here and around the country through this ministry?

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And realizing that, you know, I think that the spark of something special is happening here.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And so, hey, if you have a Bible, go ahead and turn in your Bible to James chapter 1.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 James chapter 1, we're continuing on in the series that we've been in over joy.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And I don't know about you.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I mean, people meet me and they go, man, you're just such a happy go lucky giddy kind of guy.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 But I'll be honest, sometimes when I walk into a church service and I see joy or happiness or whatever, some weeks I go, oh, great.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It's awesome.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 I can't wait to talk about being happy because that's not the week that I've had.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And I don't know if you've had that, but it's interesting as we're talking about joy today, you know, joy isn't just every circumstance being great.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 The Bible actually hits on joy being when the highs are high, but also when the lows are low.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And so I don't know what you're walking in with tonight, but maybe you're there.

103
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And actually, as I was preparing for this, I thought about the last time that my family moved.

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So we live in Houston now.

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 We used to live in Nashville, Tennessee.

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Do you guys live in Nashville?

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Okay, all right, a couple whoops.

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 We moved from Nashville to Houston.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And I remember my wife and I, we divvied up roles.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 You know, we're like, all right, I'm going to get the truck.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 You get the movers.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 We had a little moving stipend.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I said, Jen, why don't you get the movers?

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And she's like, all right, I got it.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So we ready, break.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 We come back and she's like, I found some great people.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And I'm not going to tell you the name because I don't want to defame anyone, but it's got junk in the name.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 We'll just say that, okay?

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And she tells me, I got them and they're great, great price and everything.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I'm like, really?

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 You know, I don't know.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Like, this is our stuff.

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And she goes, no, no, no, look at the reviews.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Like, they actually move stuff, not just junk.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And the reviews were good.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And then the price was amazing.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 So I was like, all right, let's do it.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 So we hired these movers.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 I go get the Penske truck.

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I go bring it back.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And these three guys go up and I'm trying so hard as I see them to not judge them.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 You know, I'm like, oh, man, I think you guys were just smoking something in the car, but whatever.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And they come up and I'm talking to them.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And then they start, you know, loading our stuff.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 And I'm dissembling, you know, high chairs and things and running errands.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And I come back after running an errand and they say, hey, we finished, sort of.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And a fourth of our stuff is still out on the front yard.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And I'm like, oh, no, this is not good.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And so I go and look at the truck and the truck is lengthwise filled, but it's only halfway up filled.

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And I go and look and it's literally, I am not kidding with you, stuff is thrown into this truck.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And I know some of you go, oh, pastors, you always exaggerate.

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I have pictures, okay.

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 This is what I saw in the back.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Let's show that first one.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Look at this.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 This is our stuff.

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Okay, I think we have another one.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Look at that.

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I mean, this is amazing.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 This is my favorite picture, the next one.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 This is, I don't know if you can tell, that says fragile and it's upside down in between two other boxes.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 And then one more, we've got the leaning tower of pizza boxes, you know, there.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And so I see all this and I go to the guys.

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I'm like, this isn't good, right?

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I mean, like something's off here.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And they're like, I don't know, man, this is just what we do.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And so I talked to him and I can't reason with him.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I'm like, y'all are fired, okay.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And I call up my dad who lives in Nashville.

160
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I call him up, I'm like, dad, this is really bad.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And he just starts cracking up on the phone.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And I'm like, dad, I'm serious, this is really bad.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He's like, I'll be right over.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 He grabs this weightlifting belt, okay, and he comes to our house.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And so it's me and him and he looks at, he surveys it and he goes, all right, I got good news and I got bad news.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 He said, the good news is we're gonna get all the stuff in this truck.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 The bad news is everything's gotta come out first.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I'm like, ah.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So we started taking everything out.

170
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 We put everything that they placed in the truck out on the yard and we start the process of loading.

171
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And as we start to load the truck, we hear a rumble in the distance.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 We're like, you are kidding me.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Look at the map, massive storm about to hit us.

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 So we're like, all right, regroup.

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So we take everything from the front yard, move it to the garage, back up the Penske truck, go and recruit some neighbors.

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 We're like, we're gonna need help.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And we load until 10 that night.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 We load up the car and finally at the end, I think we have the final picture of what it looked like.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 We loaded this truck and look how much room is left, okay.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 This is me and my Arnold Schwarzenegger dad right there with this weightlifting belt.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 All right, why do I tell you that?

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Because here's the reality during while all that was going down.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Now I was working in ministry at the time, but as we're loading this car, my dad's just cracking up the whole time.

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 I am about to lose my mind.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I'm just losing it.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 And the whole time I'm going, this is so dumb.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 This is so stupid.

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 This is so, why did we let this happen?

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And I'm just, I'm just angry.

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And the reality is sometimes in life, if we're honest, we go through things that we just go, this is so meaningless.

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 This is so stupid.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 This is so dumb.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And maybe as you look at this week or the past month and you look at your life and you go, man, there's been times where, you know, annoying things have happened in my life.

194
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 You know, maybe it's bickering between you and your roommates.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 You're like, it's just dumb.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Just like they just load the dishwasher.

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Come on.

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Right.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And it's just stupid.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 It's just meaningless.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Maybe it's arguments with your, with your parents.

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Maybe it's things at work that aren't going well.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Maybe it's a vacation that goes wrong.

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Maybe you hear through social media that Luca goes to LA too soon, too soon.

205
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Right.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And you just go, this is so dumb.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 This is so stupid.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Others of you though, it's deeper.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 It's not just dumb.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It's not just stupid.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 It's not just annoying.

212
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It's incredibly painful.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I mean, some of you this week that that person you thought you were going to go the distance with, you broke up and you're going, this is, this hurts so much.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Maybe some of you are looking at your bank account.

215
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It's tax day.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Heads up.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 It's tax deadline day.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And you're going, oh, I have to pay the government.

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 I don't even have money.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Right.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And I got to give it back.

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Others of you are looking around at, you know, at your health, at your body, and you hate the way that you look.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 You hate it.

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You just go, I just wish I could disappear.

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Others of you, it's arguments.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 It's like deep rooted things with your family.

227
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Diagnosis that you go through, whatever, depression, anxiety.

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Some of you, you cannot sleep at night and you're just staring at the ceiling going, this is so stupid.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I just want to go to sleep.

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And here's the reality of all of that.

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And why we're talking about this and why we're in James is what James is going to tell us is he's going to say there is no aspect of your life, the highest of highs or the lowest of lows, that is in vain.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 None of it.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And every moment that you experience in life is to be treated with joy.

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And we're going to unpack that.

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 So look at James chapter one.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 We're going to start in verse one.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Look at James.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 So it starts and he says, "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the 12 tribes in the dispersion, greetings."

239
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 So James starts and he identifies himself.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 He says, "I'm James," and he says, "I'm the servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ."

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Now, James was the half brother of Jesus who was skeptical of his brother's divinity early on, which if you have a brother is fair.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 If your brother was claiming to be God, some of you would go, "Yeah, no way.

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's not the truth."

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But then he saw his brother die and then rise again on the third day, and he's like, "All right, I believe you now."

245
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And James actually becomes one of the leaders of the early church.

246
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 But notice James doesn't go, "James, brother of the Lord," right?

247
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 He says, "Servant of God and of my Lord Jesus Christ."

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I mean, you talk about an identity change.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This man had it.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And then he says, "Here's my audience."

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 He says, "To the 12 tribes in the dispersion."

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Now, in Acts chapter 6, there was a guy named Stephen who got stoned to death because of his faith.

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And then persecution happened all in Jerusalem, and the people in Jerusalem, the believers, get scattered to Judea and Samaria.

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And so James is writing this letter to Christians, Jewish Christians who've been scattered, who have fled their home.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And the craziest part is the last word of verse 1.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 He says, "Greetings."

257
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's the Greek word kairo, which means rejoice, be glad.

258
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 So he's writing to people who have had to flee their homes, and he says, "Be glad, be happy, rejoice."

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And then he's gonna tell them how.

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 But I thought about, you know, in our society today, we live in a displaced time in society.

261
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 We live in post-COVID, the world that we live in, and yet the world, our culture, is telling you, "Rejoice, kairo, be happy."

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And I just sat down this week and thought, "All right, what are the ways the world is trying to sell happiness to you?"

263
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And I came up with five things that conveniently start with P, but you could come up with your own list.

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 But I'll go through these quickly.

265
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I think the world is selling happiness in one of these five ways.

266
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Number one is possessions, possessions.

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Possessions will fulfill you.

268
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I was just driving last week and saw an Amazon van, and on the van it said, "Warning, contents may cause happiness."

269
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Okay, and I thought, "Yeah, that's it."

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Like, that's what the world's trying to sell us right there, that possessions will make you happy.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Number two, the second is positions, that positions will define you.

272
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 If you're not happy with your role at work, you need a new role.

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 You're not happy with your job, you need a new job.

274
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 You're not happy in your singleness, you need to get married.

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Not happy in your marriage, you need a new marriage or no marriage, right?

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 The third is prosperity.

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 That prosperity will satisfy you.

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 If you just had that nest egg, man, if the stock market can just bounce back, if my health was better, if this pain was removed,

279
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 if I could just get a new car or a new phone or a new laptop or a new watch or new clothing, then I would be happy.

280
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 The fourth is popularity, to validate you.

281
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Some of you are so hungry to have a platform.

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 You're like, "Once I have a following on social media, then I'll arrive.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Once I have a community that I can really just relax and be myself with, then I'll be happy.

284
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Once I'm a local, like I can walk into the coffee shop and people are like, 'Bro!'"

285
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Then I've arrived.

286
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And then the fifth one, number five, is pretending.

287
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Pretend to guard yourself.

288
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You can't even be happy, so I'm just gonna pretend.

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 This is what a guy, ancient Greek philosopher named Epicurus, he had this philosophy that he called the four-part cure.

290
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 This was back thousands of years ago.

291
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 He said four things to happiness.

292
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Don't fear the gods because they're distant.

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Don't worry about death because it's just the absence of existence.

294
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Don't worry about obtaining too much good because just do the normal thing because it'll be easy.

295
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And number four, what is terrible is easy to endure.

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Pain is short and bearable, so just pretend.

297
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Everything's fine.

298
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So the culture says possessions, positions, prosperity, popularity, and pretending.

299
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 You get happiness one of those ways, and James says no.

300
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It's none of those.

301
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 James says the way to happiness is actually through perspective.

302
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It's not about what's happening out there that's going to change.

303
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It's what happens in here and my outlook at what's happening out there.

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And you go, James, that's great.

305
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 How?

306
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Look at James chapter one.

307
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Look at verse two.

308
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 He says, "Greetings, Cairo, be glad."

309
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Verse two, he says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds."

310
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 He says the way to rejoice in all seasons is to count.

311
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 That means consider, to lead your mind to a conclusion when you meet trials of various kinds.

312
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 He says no matter what you're experiencing in life, just think about this.

313
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 This is why when people are like, oh, the Bible's such a boring, old, ancient book, I go, have you read it?

314
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 James is saying, all right, you want to have joy?

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Look around at everything in your life and say, I receive this with joy.

316
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Now think about how often do we do that?

317
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I'm driving in traffic on the way here and this truck cuts me off and I'm like, ah, and then I thought about this message.

318
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I'm like, receive it all with joy.

319
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Really?

320
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 This moment?

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And yet he's saying, yes, receive it all with joy.

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Why?

323
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Because joy is this.

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Joy, Theodore Epps says, joy doesn't mean we're laughing through trials,

325
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 but that we have deep confidence that God knows what he's doing for his glory and for our good.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 That's good.

327
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Joy is not laughing, oh, everything's great.

328
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 It's not pretending like things aren't existing.

329
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Instead, it's saying, God, in the midst of what's happening right now, I know that you're in control.

330
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 I know it.

331
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And I trust that you're working a plan for my good.

332
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 He says, count it all joy.

333
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Not if you experience trials, but when.

334
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 When the trial comes upon you, rejoice.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 See, worldly happiness always goes down when circumstances are bad.

336
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Always.

337
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 All those five things, if your circumstance decreases, your worldly happiness goes down.

338
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 James is saying in Christianity, worldly, or your experiences, your environment, your circumstances can get worse.

339
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 And your happiness can increase.

340
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 How?

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Some of us are going through things that you go, there's no way.

342
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 There's no possible way I could have joy.

343
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And he's gonna give three reasons why you can.

344
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 In fact, it's not a suggestion.

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 James is saying it's a command.

346
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 If you are a believer, then everything in your life should be counted as joy.

347
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 How?

348
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And he's gonna give three reasons.

349
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Here we go.

350
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 We're gonna go through these quickly.

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Number one, three reasons to count it all joy.

352
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Everything in your life, number one, is that there's purpose in pain.

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 There's purpose in pain.

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Look at James 1, verse 3.

355
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 It says, count it all joy when you meet trials, verse 3, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.

356
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 He says, the first reason is you know that the testing of your faith is producing something.

357
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 It's producing steadfastness.

358
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Just been camping out on those words, for you know.

359
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And I'm curious, do you know when Satan attacks you, the first thing he attacks is your mind.

360
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Think about the Garden of Eden.

361
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Garden of Eden, you got Adam and Eve, they're hanging out, right?

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And the snake slithers up in the midst of the garden.

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 God has one command, don't eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And the snake slithers up and says, did God really say?

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Now in that moment, Eve should have known.

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 She should have said, no, I know.

367
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I know the truth and I believe God, not you.

368
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Get away from me, Satan.

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But instead she said, ah, and she began to argue with the snake.

370
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And then eventually convinced her and she took some, she saw the fruit was good, take it, took it,

371
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 gave it to her husband who was chilling, watching his wife talk to a snake, okay?

372
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And then we know the rest of the story.

373
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 And yet Satan does the same thing with you.

374
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 When you're going through a hard time, when that breakup happens,

375
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 when that person doesn't text you back, when that job situation fails,

376
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Satan starts and goes, come on, you knew, you knew you weren't good enough.

377
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 You knew he never liked you.

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 You knew you didn't add up as a person.

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You knew God's way wasn't good.

380
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Come on, give it up, give it up.

381
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And you better know in that moment truth to be able to fight back to Satan's lie.

382
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 You better be able to say like Psalm 56 verse nine, this I know that God is for me.

383
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It's not true, Satan, it's not true.

384
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You better be able to say Lamentations 3 verse 21 when Jeremiah is writing.

385
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And he's writing in the midst of suffering and then he stops, he says,

386
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 but this I call to mind and therefore I have hope.

387
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.

388
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 His mercies never come to an end.

389
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 They are new every morning.

390
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Great is your faithfulness.

391
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 The Lord is my portion, says my soul, therefore I will hope in him.

392
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I know the truth, and this isn't it.

393
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 You better be able to say like Paul in Romans 8 when he said,

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 for I am sure, I'm sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present

395
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 nor things to come nor power, height, depth, anything else in all creation

396
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 will be able to separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

397
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 You better be able to say like I read this morning, Psalm 84 11,

398
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 when it says, no good thing does he, God, withhold from those who walk uprightly.

399
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I know this circumstance is bad, but what I know even more is that, God,

400
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 there's nothing you're trying to withhold from me.

401
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I know it, nothing.

402
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 And James says here, I know that the testing of faith produces steadfastness.

403
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 It's producing something.

404
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And Elizabeth Elliot said, God never wastes a wound.

405
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 He never wastes it.

406
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So where is life hard right now for you?

407
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And I want to challenge you to move from asking the question, why me?

408
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 God, why me?

409
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 To asking the question, God, what are you doing in me?

410
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 If it's true that you're producing something, then what are you doing in me?

411
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And shift your gaze to going, God, help me see.

412
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I know the truth.

413
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Help me see it.

414
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Lately, I've been fascinated with a guy named Arthur Brooks.

415
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Some of you have heard of Arthur Brooks.

416
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He's a Harvard business professor, and he teaches the most popular class,

417
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 or one of the most popular classes at Harvard, called Leadership and Happiness.

418
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And he's a believer.

419
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And as I've been listening to him, I'm just fascinated by his approach to life

420
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 and happiness.

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 But one of the things that he does in his class is he has every one of his students

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 come up with a journal.

423
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 They have to keep a log of every failure and disappointment that they have in the

424
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 course of the class.

425
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And under every failure and every disappointment, they have to put two lines.

426
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 The first line, they write a month later something that they learned from this

427
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 disappointment.

428
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And then the second line, they write three months later a good thing that came

429
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 from this failure or from this hardship.

430
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And he said, as great as the class is, the number one takeaway for students is

431
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 when they do that failure and disappointment log because they begin to see,

432
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 oh, wait, this is producing something.

433
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And he has a line at the end.

434
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 He says, never waste your suffering.

435
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 It's an opportunity to learn.

436
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 It's interesting, I got to go on the team leader retreat for porch leaders here a

437
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 couple weeks ago.

438
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 And Kylan had us, he went around, he said, everyone in the circle, go around and

439
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 what was the time in your life when you felt closest to God?

440
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 And so we just went around the circle and we had things like, oh, when I got

441
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 baptized or when I was discipled.

442
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 But then all of a sudden, the mood began to shift and someone said, yeah, it was

443
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 actually when I was broken up with.

444
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And it was so hard, but I realized that was an idol and God met me there.

445
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And someone else said, you know, when my parent died and in the midst of that

446
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 difficulty, God met me there.

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Another person was like, you'll never believe it, but it was when I was caught

448
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 in the midst of hidden sin and brought that thing to the light and the community

449
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 surrounded me and I felt so near God.

450
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And then I went, I'm like, yeah, I remember when my son was in the NICU, like,

451
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 so difficult, but God met me there.

452
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 It's often in the midst of our hardship that we're learning, we're growing, it's

453
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 producing something.

454
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Last story here, there's a lady in our church that I met with last week who,

455
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 over the past two years, has gone through incredible suffering.

456
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Her and her husband have been battling infertility for years.

457
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Then two years ago, she found out first that a bunch of loved ones died in

458
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 succession.

459
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Then right after that, she got pregnant.

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 She's like, wow, God, you're bringing beauty from ashes.

461
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Then her husband has pretty intense surgery and then she has a miscarriage.

462
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And then her husband has complications from the surgery.

463
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 She has to drive him to the ER while miscarrying their baby.

464
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 For the past two years, she said, Tyler, I've gone through incredible pain.

465
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 So our church down in Houston has a prayer room.

466
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Every weekday, this woman would go from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m.

467
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 to the prayer room and sit and cry and pray for two years with God, two years.

468
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 She said, Tyler, as I've been pouring myself out before God, here's been my

469
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 prayer.

470
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 My prayer has been, God, override my heart and give me your desire.

471
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 She said this, I want my guts to match yours.

472
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Who prays like that?

473
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 You know who prays like that?

474
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It's somebody who's been through the fire.

475
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And even though wanting to throw in the towel and say, God, help, why me?

476
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Instead turns it to, God, what are you doing in me?

477
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 What are you doing?

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And all of a sudden, you begin to pray like this book.

479
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Your life begins to look, and it doesn't mean life's easy.

480
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 She hasn't had a baby.

481
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Life's not all perfect.

482
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 But on Sunday, this past Sunday, she led, she helped to lead Palm Sunday

483
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 gathering for women, and she sang and led worship about the goodness of God.

484
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I mean, you talk about, and she's telling me in tears a couple days ago,

485
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 like, God is so good, Tyler.

486
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 God is so good.

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I go, man, I want some of that.

488
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And you get that through the fire.

489
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Don't buy the lie that your suffering's meaningless.

490
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 It's not.

491
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 It's producing something in you if you will hold on.

492
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 That's the first thing.

493
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 James says, you want to be able to count it all joy?

494
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 You need to see your suffering is producing something.

495
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 There's purpose in the pain.

496
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 Second thing, quickly, second thing, there's perfection in the process.

497
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 There's perfection in the process.

498
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Let's keep reading.

499
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Look at verse 4.

500
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 He says, "And let steadfastness have its full effect,

501
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."

502
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Okay, this is a crazy verse.

503
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Think about that.

504
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Let's read it again.

505
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 He says, "So count it all joy and suffering.

506
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It's producing steadfastness," verse 4,

507
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 "and let steadfastness have its full effect,

508
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."

509
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 So he's saying, as you go through suffering

510
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 and God is producing something in you,

511
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 you're on the road to perfection.

512
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 So you go, whoa, whoa, perfect?

513
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Nobody's perfect.

514
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 This word in Greek for perfect is the word teleos,

515
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 which means whole or mature.

516
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 He's going, as you go through suffering,

517
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 you're becoming a whole person.

518
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I love what Tim Mackey says.

519
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 We have it on the screen.

520
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 He says, "In biblical Hebrew and Greek,

521
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 this word teleos refers to wholeness.

522
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 It means living a completely integrated life

523
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 where your actions are always consistent

524
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 with the values and belief that you received from Jesus."

525
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 He said, "Most of us actually live as fractured people

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 with big inconsistencies in our character.

527
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 We are all more compromised than we want to admit.

528
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 However, God is on a mission to restore fractured people

529
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 and make them whole."

530
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 See, God is not just trying to get you through your trial.

531
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 He's trying to grow you in the midst of it.

532
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And oftentimes, the great refining moment of our lives

533
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 is when we go through a trial, why?

534
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Because adversity introduces you to yourself.

535
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 What do I mean by that?

536
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Adversity introduces you to yourself.

537
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I was talking with someone last week,

538
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 and I was kind of listening to him,

539
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and he was saying that we live in an age where he says,

540
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 he calls it an hour of fragmentation.

541
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 He said, "We live in a day and age

542
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 where everybody is double-minded."

543
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 I said, "What do you mean?"

544
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 He said, "It's the idea of," this is a simple example,

545
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 but it's like when you ask someone,

546
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 "Hey, do you want to go to this thing?"

547
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 And they say, "Oh, well, part of me does,

548
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 and part of me doesn't."

549
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Right? Have you ever done that?

550
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Part of me does, but I don't know, part of me doesn't.

551
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 That's the idea of living fragmented.

552
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And that's a simple example, we all do that.

553
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 The problem is when you live your whole life,

554
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 and every conversation is you're going,

555
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 "Should I show up as this person

556
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 or should I show up as this person?"

557
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And you begin to wonder, "Who am I really?"

558
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And in the moment of trial,

559
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 adversity introduces you to yourself.

560
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 You find out who you really are.

561
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 And so I'm curious, where is your life fractured?

562
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Where are you living in such a way

563
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 where you're showing up as different people

564
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 in different environments?

565
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And where's God inviting you to be more whole?

566
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 As I'm leaving the church down in Houston,

567
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I'm having a lot of conversations with people, close friends,

568
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 as we say our goodbyes.

569
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And one of the things that I do with everybody who's close,

570
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I ask them at the end a really risky question, really risky.

571
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 I say, "Hey, what is one thing that you are praying

572
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 God grows in me over the next year?"

573
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 It's a risky question,

574
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 because people who love you will tell you the truth.

575
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 And I've had a couple of people who've loved me

576
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 and they've told me the truth, and it's hurt.

577
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And one of the things that I've heard now multiple times,

578
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I just heard it again last week,

579
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 is one guy, I sat down, "Hey, what's one thing you want me to,

580
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 you're praying God grows in me?"

581
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 He goes, "Yeah, Tyler, I'm praying

582
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 that you would become more vulnerable

583
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 when you go up to Dallas,

584
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 that you open up more to your community."

585
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And I'll be honest, when I hear that, it stings,

586
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 because I so badly wanna be a vulnerable person.

587
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 I don't wanna have anything hidden, I just wanna be real.

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And so I'm calling mentors,

589
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 I'm meeting with them at their house,

590
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 I'm texting different guys every day,

591
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 I'm trying to get staff and people in my world

592
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 to speak into my life.

593
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 And yet, as I really sat with the Lord with that question,

594
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 I realized, wow, I actually think part of it's true.

595
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 And I remember talking to one guy and he said,

596
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 "You know, one problem with you, Tyler,

597
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 is you're such a good listener,

598
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 you ask a bunch of good questions,

599
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 but you never turn it back on yourself."

600
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And I realized, often for me,

601
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I'm thinking about that other person

602
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 kind of because I care about them,

603
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 but also kind of because I want them to like me,

604
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 and I gotta show up, I gotta realize,

605
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 who do I need to be in this conversation

606
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 so that you like me back?

607
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And so whatever clues I'm getting,

608
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I'm just gonna use that in this conversation.

609
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 And I very rarely go,

610
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 "Can I just be super raw and real with you?"

611
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And so as I've been sitting with that,

612
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 I realized we've been trying to sell our house

613
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 down in Houston and find something up here,

614
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 and there's been some adversity.

615
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 And as the adversity has hit me,

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 the real Tyler has come out, mostly in my home.

617
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And as the real Tyler has come out,

618
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 it's just been this confrontation of like,

619
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 "Oh, wow, there's so much work to do."

620
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 I mean, even I've joked about getting cut off,

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 but on the way up, cut off by a semi,

622
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 and just everything in me wanted to be like,

623
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 "What, boo!"

624
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 You know, like, and just realizing,

625
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 "Oh, okay, like, I don't think it's wrong to honk, okay?

626
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 "We're Texans, but still, it's okay to honk.

627
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 "But maybe the words you would say along with the honk

628
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 "or the fingers, maybe not, but not me, you, not me."

629
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 (congregation laughing)

630
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But we realize in that moment, God is giving you a gift

631
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 because He's showing you in our hour of fragmentation

632
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 who you really are.

633
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 And it's only when you know

634
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 and you're honest with God of here's where I am,

635
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 then He can go, "I can deal with that.

636
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 "I can deal with who you really are.

637
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 "I can't deal with this fake mess that you're pulling off

638
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 "with showing up this way and this way and this way.

639
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 "You just gotta be real."

640
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Integrity means integer of one.

641
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 Where you live your life, here's who I am.

642
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 And adversity introduces you to yourself.

643
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Where in your life are you going through adversity right now

644
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 that you're just so ready to get through?

645
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 This is so stupid, I just wanna make it through.

646
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 And maybe God's going, "Ah, I'm seeing who you really are

647
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 "and I'm wanting to deal with it.

648
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 "I'm not gonna move you out of this season

649
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 "until I deal with this."

650
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And some of you don't just need to wait

651
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 for the trial to come to you.

652
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Some of you need to go and ask the risky question

653
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 that I've been asking to community that you trust.

654
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 "Hey, what's one thing you're praying God grows in me?"

655
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 And allow them to be honest and receive it when it comes.

656
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Suffering, there's purpose in pain.

657
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 That's why we can have joy in suffering is there's purpose.

658
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Two, there's perfection in the process.

659
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 And then number three, quickly, lastly,

660
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 is there's a promise in the end.

661
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 There's a promise in the end.

662
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 Look at James chapter one, verse 12.

663
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 Skip down to verse 12.

664
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 I love this verse.

665
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 If you underline in your Bible, I would underline this verse.

666
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 James says, "Blessed," which means happy,

667
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 "is the man who remains steadfast under trial.

668
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 "For when he has stood the test,

669
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 "he will receive the crown of life,

670
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 "which God has promised to those who love him."

671
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 I love this verse.

672
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 James says, "Blessed, happy, spiritually rich,

673
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 "successful in God's eyes,

674
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 "is not the one who makes it through this life

675
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 "with no suffering and no hardship,

676
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 "and everything was great,

677
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 "and then met the special someone,

678
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 "and lived in the gated community,

679
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 "and fell asleep, died in my sleep,

680
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "and just levitated to heaven, and everything was perfect."

681
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 He goes, "Oh, what a blessed life.

682
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 "You just did it."

683
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 He goes, "No, in my eyes, that's not the blessed life."

684
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 You know what the blessed life is, according to this verse?

685
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 The one who's steadfast under trial.

686
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 The one who had it hard, and you stood close with Jesus.

687
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 You just abided with him.

688
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 You didn't leave.

689
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 You just said, "Jesus, you're all I have,

690
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 "and you're all I want,

691
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 "and so I'm just gonna hold fast to you

692
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 "even though I don't have any answers."

693
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 And he goes, "Man, that's the one

694
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 "who's spiritually rich, in my eyes.

695
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 "That's the one that's successful."

696
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 And heaven goes, "Wow, #blessed for that person."

697
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 I mean, isn't that crazy?

698
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 I was thinking, even he says,

699
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 "Not only are you blessed,

700
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 "but you receive the crown of life."

701
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 I've just been thinking, what is the crown of life?

702
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 What must that be?

703
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 And the reality is, it's not so much a ruler's crown.

704
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 It's a victor's wreath.

705
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 It's like in the Olympics,

706
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 when they would finish the marathon or whatever,

707
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 and they'd receive the wreath.

708
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 That's the idea of this crown.

709
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 It's this idea of eternal reward, eternal life.

710
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 You made it, you did it.

711
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 You stayed close to Jesus.

712
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 And there's something about getting that wreath,

713
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 getting that reward,

714
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 that puts all the rest of your life in perspective.

715
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 I mean, we just saw this on Sunday.

716
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 For those of you who watched the Masters,

717
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 I don't know how many of you watched it, okay?

718
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 But if you're gonna watch a Masters,

719
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 this was the one to watch, okay?

720
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 You got Rory McIlroy, right?

721
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And he's amazing.

722
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 He's won 'em all, except he can't win the Masters.

723
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 In fact, he hasn't won a major in 11 years.

724
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 The guy's cursed.

725
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 He can't do it.

726
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 He fails under pressure.

727
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Ah, right?

728
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 But the first three days, he's doing great.

729
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 He's killing it.

730
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 The best match, but it's the final day.

731
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Oh boy, Rory, your lead is gonna go away.

732
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 And he has to fight the mental battles, right?

733
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 And he gets up and first shot, first hole, what happens?

734
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 You get double bogey, okay?

735
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 Just totally, ah, and everyone's like, we knew it.

736
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 He's a failure, right?

737
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 And then he starts to get back.

738
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 And then on the 13th hole, he hits it in the water.

739
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 And everyone's like, ah, see?

740
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Knew he was gonna blow it in the end.

741
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 But then he makes his way back.

742
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 18th hole, he hits this little putt

743
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 that you and I could hit.

744
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 And he misses it, okay?

745
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And everyone's like, ah, we knew it.

746
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 And then it goes into the playoffs.

747
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 And he has to play the same hole that he just blew it on.

748
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Except this time, first shot kills it.

749
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Second shot right in the money.

750
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 And then the third, he just knocks it in.

751
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 And what is the first thing that he does?

752
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 For those of you who watch,

753
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 first thing he did, fell on the ground

754
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 and started sobbing after he got the Masters.

755
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 And then they asked him after the match,

756
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 what did you feel?

757
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And this is what he said.

758
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 He said, this was the best day of my golfing life.

759
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Really?

760
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 You hit it in the water.

761
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 You double bogeyed on the beginning.

762
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 You missed the shot that any of us could have made.

763
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Really, the best day of your golfing life?

764
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Why?

765
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 'Cause he got the crown.

766
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 He made it.

767
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 He did it.

768
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 And it put in perspective all the hardship

769
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 to where he goes, it was all putting,

770
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 it was painting this portrait that I can now see.

771
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 And if I went back, would I do it different?

772
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Yeah, maybe, but I want this.

773
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 This is what it's all about.

774
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 And it puts everything in perspective.

775
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And the interesting thing is, as great as that story is,

776
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 and whoop to Rory,

777
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 but the reality is,

778
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 look at it says who the crown of life is promised to.

779
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 It doesn't say the crown of life is promised

780
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 to the one who nails it, man.

781
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 It doesn't even say the crown of life is promised

782
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 to the one who endures to the end,

783
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 who believes, who doesn't deny Jesus.

784
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 It doesn't say any of that.

785
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 It just says it's promised to the one who loves him.

786
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 That's it.

787
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 And I love the simplicity of that.

788
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 What is James saying here?

789
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 What's God saying here?

790
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 It's like, look, the crown of life is not earned

791
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 at the end by just suffering through it.

792
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 Oh, I just bear it.

793
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 It's this idea of God in the midst of everything.

794
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 I just love you.

795
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 I just love you.

796
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 I've made the decision.

797
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 I've crossed over the line.

798
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And now no matter what happens in life,

799
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 I'm not leaving you.

800
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 I'm not leaving.

801
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 And some of you, you need to hear tonight

802
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 in our joy series, where you're going,

803
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 oh, I don't wanna see the sunflowers anymore, right?

804
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 You're going, oh, and some of you,

805
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 what you need to hear today is,

806
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 you may not have strength to endure.

807
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 You may not have hope inside you.

808
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Do you just have love in your heart

809
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 for the man who has shown love for you first?

810
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 And do you go, ah, it's just, I don't have any answers.

811
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 I don't know anything else.

812
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 I just love him.

813
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 And everything else is secondary to that.

814
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 See, the night before Jesus died,

815
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 Jesus told his disciples something interesting.

816
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 In John chapter 15, verse 11, he says,

817
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 "These things," all of this, "that I've spoken to you,

818
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 "these things I've spoken to you,

819
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 "that my joy would be in you,

820
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 "and that your joy would be full."

821
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 See, Jesus, I've been thinking about this.

822
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 Jesus is the, he's God, and he's the one who,

823
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 the fruit of the Spirit comes from God,

824
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 and one of the fruits of the Spirit is joy.

825
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 So Jesus is, I think Jesus was the most joyful

826
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 human being to ever live.

827
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 And yet Jesus, it says in Isaiah 52,

828
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 it says he was despised and rejected,

829
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.

830
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 The shortest verse in the whole Bible is John 11, 35.

831
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 Some of you, it's the only verse you've ever memorized,

832
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 okay, but good for you, you have one memorized.

833
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 If not, you can memorize it tonight.

834
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 It's what?

835
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Jesus wept, he wept.

836
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 And on the way to the cross,

837
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 so this is a man who was filled with joy

838
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 and yet felt every emotion.

839
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 On the way to the cross, in Hebrews chapter 12,

840
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 it says that for the joy that was set before him,

841
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 he endured the cross, despising its shame,

842
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 and now he's seated in heaven.

843
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 So God, you know, Jesus, not only did he feel

844
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 all the emotion of being a human being

845
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 and experience the fullness of having the joy that God has,

846
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 but he looked at the cross and he was able

847
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 to see the purpose and he was able to embrace

848
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 the shame and enjoy.

849
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 He said, "Father, out of love for you, I endure this."

850
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 And I think some of you, Jesus is not only

851
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 the means of your joy, but he's the primary,

852
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 ultimate model of it.

853
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 And when you're in the midst of the darkness

854
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 looking to the man, this is holy week.

855
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 This is when we celebrate what Jesus did

856
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 and you go, "God, I've got nothing to give,

857
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 "but I'm looking at the God-man on the tree

858
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 "who for the joy set before him endured that cross,

859
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 "despising the shame, to the glory of his Father

860
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 "and to empower us, to fill us with his spirit

861
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 "such that we can do the same."

862
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 I wanna end with this last story before we worship again.

863
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 I heard this story years ago and I've had this prayer

864
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 up in my office for years and I've thought about it again.

865
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 But back, there's a little bit of legend with this,

866
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 but in the 1980s, around then, there was a man

867
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 in Rwanda who loved Jesus.

868
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 And the rest of his tribe came to him and they said,

869
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 "You either deny Jesus or we will kill you."

870
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 And the man said, "I will never deny Jesus.

871
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
 "Do with me what you will."

872
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 And that very day, they killed him, done.

873
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 Which crazy is, when they went back to his room

874
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 and found the prayer that he had written.

875
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 And every few months, I go back and read this prayer

876
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 because on the day of trial, which is coming for all of us,

877
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 some of us are in it, some of us are, it's coming.

878
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 Where will you run to and what will you say?

879
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 And I hope there's a level of what this prayer says

880
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
 that's in your vocabulary.

881
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 And the prayer says this.

882
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
 He had written this the night before he died.

883
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 He said, "I am a part of the fellowship of the unashamed."

884
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 He said, "I have Holy Spirit power.

885
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 "The die has been cast, I've stepped over the line,

886
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 "the decision has been made, I am a disciple of his.

887
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 "I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away,

888
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
 "or be still.

889
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 "My past is redeemed.

890
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 "My present makes sense.

891
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 "My future is secure.

892
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 "I'm finished and done with low living and sight walking

893
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 "and small planning and smooth knees and colorless dreams

894
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 "and tamed vision and worldly talking

895
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
 "and cheap giving and dwarf goals.

896
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 "I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position,

897
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 "promotions, plaudity, or popularity.

898
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 "I don't have to be right, first, tops, recognized,

899
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
 "praised, regarded, or rewarded.

900
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 "I now live by faith, lean on his presence,

901
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
 "walk by patience, am uplifted by prayer,

902
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 "and labor by power.

903
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 "My pace is set, my gait is fast, my goal is heaven,

904
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 "my road is narrow, my way is rough, my companions few,

905
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
 "my guide reliable, my mission is clear.

906
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 "I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away,

907
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 "turned back, deluded, or delayed.

908
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 "I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice,

909
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 "hesitate in the presence of the adversary,

910
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
 "negotiate at the table of the enemy,

911
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
 "pander at the pool of popularity,

912
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 "or meander in the maze of mediocrity.

913
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 "I won't give up, shut up, let up,

914
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
 "until I've stayed up, stored up, prayed up,

915
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
 "paid up, preached up for the cause of Christ.

916
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
 "I must go till he comes, give till I drop,

917
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
 "preach till all know, and work till he stops me.

918
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
 "And when he comes for his own,

919
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
 "he will have no problem recognizing me.

920
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 "My banner will be clear.

921
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
 "I am a disciple of Jesus."

922
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 I just think, and then the next day,

923
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
 died for the one that he loved.

924
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 And some of us, the moment of stepping over the line

925
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 has not really happened in your life.

926
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
 You've been meandering in the maze of mediocrity.

927
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 You've been pandering in the pool of popularity.

928
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
 You've just been living in that

929
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
 and it's sucking all the joy out of you.

930
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 You're trying to get it from all of these things.

931
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
 And Jesus is saying, "Listen, I'm here

932
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 "and I wanna give you my joy."

933
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
 And it's through the road of suffering, not around it.

934
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
 But with me, you can make it through.

935
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 And maybe for some of you, it's tonight going, "I'm in.

936
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
 "I've crossed over the line.

937
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
 "The decision has been made.

938
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 "I'm a disciple of Jesus."

939
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
 And joy comes through knowing him.

940
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 So here in a minute, I'm gonna pray.

941
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 And then there's gonna be people up here

942
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
 and let's commune with God.

943
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
 Let's not make this just another throwaway moment

944
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 of kind of transition.

945
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
 Let's actually talk to the one that we love.

946
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 So would you close your eyes and let's pray.

947
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
 Father, it's our joy to be near you.

948
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 You are the treasure on the field worth selling everything for.

949
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
 And so Father, I just pray in your name, God,

950
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 that you would stir up in us

951
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 a deep desire to know you no matter what it costs.

952
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 And Father, I just believe there are young adults

953
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 across Dallas and across this country

954
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 who are sick of the lie of the enemy

955
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
 and the lie of our culture that says,

956
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 "If you just had this, if you just had this,

957
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 "then you would be happy."

958
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
 And some going, "No, no, no, I know better than that.

959
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 "That thing, that person, that career will not satisfy me.

960
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 "I need you."

961
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
 And yet I've never felt you enough, God,

962
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 where you really supply that kind of deep-hearted trust

963
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
 and joy.

964
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
 And God, I just pray by the miracle of your spirit

965
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
 that for some of us, that would happen tonight.

966
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
 You would infuse us with such joy

967
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
 that all of our lives would be impacted,

968
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
 not with giddy laughing,

969
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
 but with a deep-seated trust that you are God, we are not.

970
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
 Now come Holy Spirit, invade this place

971
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
 and infuse our hearts with that kind of joy.

972
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
 We love you and we trust you, in Jesus' name, amen.

973
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
 Hey, take the time to pray.

974
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
 People are up here,

975
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
 and then we're gonna worship together.

976
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,340
