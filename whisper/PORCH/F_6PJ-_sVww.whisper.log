[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:23.960]   How's it going?
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.640]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.720]   Doing good?
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.560]   Awesome.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.120]   If you have your Bibles, Genesis 1.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.000]   If you don't know where that is,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.200]   just open to the first page.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.160]   And there you have it.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.840]   We'll be in Genesis 1, maybe Genesis 2.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.600]   We'll see how this goes.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.080]   I just kind of start the clock and get running
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.040]   and we just end when we end.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.880]   That's how I tend to do it.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.280]   We'll see how fun that is.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.400]   I'm excited to be with you guys.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.480]   Man, it has been a long time since I've been with you guys.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.900]   I don't know if anyone's been coming to the porch
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.720]   for a long time, but I spoke a handful of times
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.480]   like four or five years ago, did launch retreat back then,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.320]   and then took a big break from the porch family,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.160]   but it's good to be back.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.980]   I miss you guys.
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.820]   You guys are awesome.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.200]   I miss you guys back.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.840]   So again, the series, Datable.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.280]   I'm just gonna jump into it
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.880]   because I am so excited for tonight.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.640]   I'm excited for us to lean in to the scriptures.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760]   Now, there's kind of this axiom
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.720]   that I think is, we would all resonate with,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.820]   and it's essentially this.
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.520]   It's essentially that so many of us,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.660]   and I know this resonates with me
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.160]   and specifically in my mid-20s,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.440]   that life can be going poorly.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.420]   Everything around you can be kind of breaking apart
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.160]   or falling apart, but if you have a relationship
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.520]   that's relatively healthy
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.600]   or you're doing it the right way,
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.640]   it's crazy how everything can feel fine.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.160]   And the flip is true as well, right?
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.420]   Where everything in your life can be going well.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.320]   Jobs, promotion, maybe a promotion with money,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.200]   certain things, certain whatever,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   but if there's something in a relationship
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.600]   that is breaking you, that's difficult,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.040]   or you're making unwise choices
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.320]   that's kind of destroying your soul and your heart,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   then it's crazy how it feels like everything is breaking.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.680]   What I'm saying with that is there's something
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.360]   about God's design for human relationships
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.960]   that is central to who we are.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.880]   And I mean that, by the way, single, dating, or not, right?
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.800]   I mean in the sense of just how we feel about them,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.120]   how we think about them, how we enter into them.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.960]   There's something about human relationships
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.640]   that is very close to how God wired us,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   how God designed us, and who we are.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.600]   So that's what we're gonna talk about tonight.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.840]   We're gonna talk about what is God's design
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.460]   for human flourishing, for human relationships,
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.020]   for sexuality, and all these different types of things.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.600]   We're gonna go all the way back to the beginning
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.940]   and look at what I like to say is the blueprint, okay?
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.840]   Now when I say the word blueprint, what do you think of?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.520]   I don't know about you, I actually think of Jay-Z's albums.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.400]   Anyone else?
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.720]   Okay, besides that, what you probably think of
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.160]   is architectural drawings or something of that nature.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.920]   A blueprint tends to be a framework, a map,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.560]   a thing that you look at in regards to showing you
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.400]   the design of something before what?
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.640]   Before you go on and build something, right?
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.240]   Before you go on and do something.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.720]   And so it is with God's design for us with relationships,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.360]   where he has a blueprint.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.400]   If you try to go forward without it,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   have fun building a house without a blueprint,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.440]   see how that goes.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.720]   It doesn't end well.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.600]   It doesn't end well, but if we listen to the wisdom of God,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.520]   how he's created and wired us to work,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.560]   then that's what leads us to flourishing.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.900]   So we're gonna go back and look at that.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.720]   So again, if you have your Bibles,
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.100]   let's go to Genesis chapter one.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.240]   And I'm not gonna cover all of the points,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.640]   but I think there's, what I wanna do is cover,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.480]   I think, some of the more often missed ones.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.840]   And so we'll just start reading and go from there.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.860]   Genesis chapter one, let's go down to verse 26 for me.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.960]   I might have a tough time reading it too,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.200]   'cause my two-year-old just ripped this yesterday, so.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.840]   Yeah, I mean, the kid's just ripping the scriptures.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.080]   Like, what kind of hatred for God is that?
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.920]   Okay.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.640]   Verse 26, "Then God said,
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.400]   "let us make man in our image after our likeness,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.880]   "and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.760]   "and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.080]   "and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.060]   "that creeps on the earth."
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.840]   Verse 27, "So God created man," what?
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.820]   "In his own image.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.400]   "In the image of God, he created him,
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.040]   "male and female, he created them.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   "And God blesses them.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.480]   "And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.920]   "and fill the earth and subdue it,
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.800]   "and have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.000]   "and over the birds of the heaven,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.260]   "and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.840]   So we're just gonna sit there for a second,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.920]   'cause there's a lot in there.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.000]   But the first one I wanna zoom in on is what we saw there.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.720]   What was the word that came up just a couple times
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.560]   in three verses?
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.880]   Starts with an I.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.060]   Image.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.740]   Chapter one, verses 27 and 28,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.100]   "In the image of God, you were created,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.420]   "male and female, in the image of God, he created them."
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.560]   Now what does that mean?
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.580]   I wanna sit there for a second,
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.780]   because I know I didn't have a ton of church context
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.320]   growing up, I didn't start walking with the Lord 'til 19,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.400]   but I had enough to kind of feel like
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.740]   maybe I heard some of these ideas.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.420]   And at least to me growing up,
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.100]   I always was either taught or just assumed
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.120]   that the image of God in the scriptures
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.740]   was about characteristics of God passed on to us.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.660]   Kind of like God is loving, God is holy,
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.220]   God is creative, all these different types of things.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.780]   And so that's what it means to be created
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.940]   in the image of God, right?
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.380]   That's kind of just how I assumed what that phrase meant.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.580]   Now at some level that's true,
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.380]   but that's not what the text is trying to say.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.840]   That's almost a byproduct definition.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.620]   Image of God in the ancient Near East,
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.460]   which literally again is where this text
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.700]   was written out of and from,
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.700]   you have to understand the context,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.580]   was actually not about characteristics,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.780]   but it was about vocation.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.300]   Vocation, job, right?
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.080]   You have been given a job to do
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.400]   because you are a royal signpost,
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.320]   a royal ambassador of creator Yahweh.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.500]   Are you tracking?
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.520]   That God has actually commissioned you
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.720]   and having the image of God in you
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.920]   means you are to be a small divine reflector,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.160]   or I mean a reflector of the divine.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.200]   And so whether that's in relationships, by the way,
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.680]   or whether that's in your job,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.920]   whether that's how you treat money,
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.160]   you are to be a divine reflector in your world,
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.700]   in your context, in your city.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.700]   Is that true?
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.700]   Are you trying to reflect God's image
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.740]   or are you resisting the image he puts on you?
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.100]   That's by the way how you define sin,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.300]   is resisting the image he has put on you.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.740]   Do you reflect who he is and how he has created you to be?
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.580]   It has to do with your vocation.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.660]   He has given us jobs to do.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.860]   Another way to think about it is,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.500]   again, I always had this idea that,
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.340]   like here's the question,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.140]   what would you say peak spirituality is?
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.660]   What would you say peak Christianity is?
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.000]   Most of us, if we think of like the high moment,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.980]   it's what?
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.820]   It's what?
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.740]   Maybe sitting in our prayer closet,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.460]   praying for five hours, listening to Hillsong,
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.300]   and maybe Maverick City.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.620]   Anyone else?
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.820]   Great music, by the way.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.100]   But I might just critique that a little bit
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.560]   and say that's not what it means to be human,
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.020]   that's actually what it means to be an angel.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.580]   You ever thought about that?
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.980]   So what does it mean to be an angel in scripture?
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.940]   Anytime an angel shows up in scripture,
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.620]   what are they doing?
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.460]   They're basically kneeling.
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.960]   I mean, besides the few times they have a human interaction
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.540]   when they're around God, what are they doing?
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.780]   They're kneeling at his feet, worshiping him.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.700]   Now, is that a part of what it means to be human?
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.900]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.220]   But does Genesis say that's what it means to be human?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.980]   I don't see that anywhere in Genesis.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.220]   What do I see?
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.980]   You are created as an image bearer of God,
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.460]   which means you are a human, and human means to work.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.500]   Go do the job I have given you.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.740]   So many times we over-spiritualize
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.920]   this version of Christianity
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.380]   and under-spiritualize this version,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.100]   which is God has given you a job.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.140]   That is to properly reflect him
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.600]   in every avenue of your life.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.940]   Another way to think about it is
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.340]   being an image bearer of God,
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.340]   and again, in relationships,
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.260]   is almost like being a 45-degree angled mirror.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.780]   I know that's a weird way to put it, right?
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.320]   But any geometry students in here,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.340]   if God is kind of like giving his love,
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.580]   his goodness, his grace, and who he is
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.120]   and his character down on a 45-degree angled mirror,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.960]   where does it go?
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.460]   Any geometry students out there?
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.000]   45-degree angled mirror, it comes down, it goes out.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.540]   Right, so we are to reflect,
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.580]   we are to absorb all that he is,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.500]   all that he, who he is,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.100]   and what he has for us in creation,
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.540]   and reflect it out into the world.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.180]   But by the way, it's a two-way street.
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.260]   What it means to be an image bearer
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.680]   is actually to take all of creation,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.180]   and do what?
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.380]   Create order out of chaos
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.340]   and reflect it back up to him in worship.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.220]   So it's a two-way street
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.820]   of that's what it means to be an image bearer.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.460]   One other fun fact,
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.660]   do you know when they've done a lot of digging
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.580]   and archeological sites in antiquity,
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.820]   and they find old statues and ruins
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.580]   of statues of old Roman emperors,
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.700]   like a Caesar or a Nero or something like that?
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.140]   Do you know whenever they find those statues,
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.900]   it's always thousands of miles away from Rome,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.340]   and they've never found one statue in Rome
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.380]   of Caesar or Nero?
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.660]   Now why is that?
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.700]   Why would you guess
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.100]   that there's a bunch of Caesar statues
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.340]   thousands of miles away in the farthest colony,
[00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.120]   but none in Rome, why?
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.860]   Where do you not need a statue of Caesar?
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.020]   Where the real guy lives, right?
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.240]   Are you tracking?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.780]   But where do you need one?
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.940]   In the farther outermost points of the colonies
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.220]   to do what, by the way?
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.780]   Why do we have statues out there?
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.140]   Hey, this is who is in charge.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.740]   This is who the authority is.
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.540]   This is the king.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.180]   I think that's a really interesting way, by the way,
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.060]   to think about what it means to be an image bearer
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.640]   or a human in the heaven and earth dimension, okay?
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.620]   That it specifically says
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.940]   God created the heavens and the earth,
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.720]   and that humans were created on earth
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.700]   to be those outermost statues that do what?
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.700]   What's our job?
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.580]   To live in a way that says what?
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.500]   This is who's in charge.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.700]   This is who is in charge.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.500]   Are you doing that in your relationships?
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.780]   In the way that you're going about dating,
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.780]   in the way you're treating her,
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.380]   in the way you're treating him?
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.700]   Are you showing who is in charge?
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.660]   Yahweh or you, by the way?
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.420]   'Cause there's only one true king.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.580]   But we all have a choice to show who that is.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.740]   And I'll just go with that one step farther too, by the way.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.820]   That's an interesting way to think about sin and hell,
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.340]   if you think about it.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.980]   When a statue is in the farthest outermost points
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.900]   of a colony, and let's say a new empire
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.820]   takes over that colony,
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.700]   and Rome is no longer in charge there,
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.300]   two things, there's two possibilities
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.260]   that would happen to that statue, what?
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.700]   One, the enemy either just tears it down,
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.060]   or two, because they're not that,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.180]   they don't care about Caesar,
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.580]   they no longer maintain it, and it begins to crumble.
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.340]   What a fascinating picture of sin.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.100]   What a fascinating picture of sin.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.460]   That when you stop reflecting God's image,
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.900]   and you take on something else in your heart,
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.140]   and you give it ultimate allegiance,
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:13.500]   then you begin to crumble your humanness.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.580]   Or in a way, the enemy actually wants to attack it
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.780]   and tear you down.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.460]   And I think, by the way, that's an interesting look at hell.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.380]   Hell is nothing more than basically God saying,
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.340]   you don't want the image of me on you anymore?
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.180]   Okay.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.420]   And he just takes the entire image off.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.860]   And there's historical precedent, by the way,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.340]   for that, C.S. Lewis, Tim Keller,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.420]   some of the early church fathers,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.940]   that's how they would describe it.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.580]   Hell is this gnarly place where it's actually God saying,
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.420]   you don't want my image on you anymore?
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.840]   Okay, fine.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.820]   What would we be like without the image of God?
[00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.820]   I don't know, but I don't wanna see it.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.980]   And again, so many of us,
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.540]   in the choices we're making with our sexuality,
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.140]   with our bodies, with our hearts,
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.940]   with our thoughts, and with our minds,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.540]   because we are not showing
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.140]   and being under the authority of God,
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.420]   we are crumbling our humanness.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.420]   We are eroding and destroying ourselves
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.660]   by the decisions we're making
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.380]   by not being under the authority
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.700]   and the reign and rule of God.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.900]   That's what it means to be an image bearer.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.500]   Another way, the last way I'll put it
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.100]   before the next point is,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.580]   when you're an image bearer,
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.300]   your life and your body is telling a story.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.860]   Your life and your body is telling a story.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.400]   Let it be the true one.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.940]   Let it be the right one.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.240]   Let it be the one of human flourishing and goodness.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.120]   Another way to say it is,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.840]   don't let your body say something that your life isn't.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.320]   Anyone who's having sex before marriage,
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.080]   you're basically just letting your body tell a lie.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.720]   You're basically saying, you know,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.380]   I don't wanna be with you for life.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.360]   I don't wanna join in a covenant.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.640]   I don't wanna do all these things,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.400]   but I'm gonna let my body say that that's true.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.080]   I'm gonna let my body tell that story
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.200]   when nothing else in my life tells that story.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.840]   God's a cohesive God, by the way.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.160]   He's a God of unity,
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.920]   where he actually created sexuality
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   to not be this random thing that's arbitrary,
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.580]   but actually for it to be a picture
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.800]   that's lining up with everything else
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.680]   that's already happening.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.200]   That we are under a covenant together.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.400]   That we are brought together in joinment, right?
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.040]   In the scriptures, the two will become what?
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.600]   One flesh.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.000]   In sexuality, in finances, in life, in emotions,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.400]   whatever it is, there is a merging
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.560]   of two people becoming one.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.460]   Don't let your body tell a lie.
[00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.600]   Point two, God seemed to say here,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.160]   and then also in chapter two,
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   that he gave them a massive, enormous job to do,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.360]   and that they can't do it alone,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.360]   so he actually creates a team.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.200]   He doesn't just create Adam and say,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.400]   okay, now go do what I just asked you to do.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.840]   He immediately says, specifically there,
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.280]   but also in Genesis two, around 13 and 14,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.120]   that you cannot do this alone, and so what?
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.120]   I have created you to be a team.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.160]   I have created a distinct, different individual from you
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.520]   that you can merge together with her
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.480]   and go on mission together.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.480]   God created us in our relationships to be a team.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.320]   When you're dating, when you're in that season
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.180]   of looking for someone you wanna spend
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.520]   the rest of your life with,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.200]   the best thing you should be asking is,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.280]   does this person make me a better team?
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.600]   A better person?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.200]   Do they actually take me, I don't wanna say it
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.760]   in like an egotistical way,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.440]   but like, does this person make me better?
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.280]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.560]   Like, do they make me better spiritually,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.120]   emotionally, and all these different types of things?
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.440]   Do they actually create,
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.760]   do they make me more into the image of God
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.840]   by being merged with them?
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.520]   That's a question you should ask.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.360]   But you know what's funny is,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.340]   the Western narratives tend to be the opposite.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.140]   We're not looking for teams, we're looking for clones.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.140]   Is that not true?
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.500]   The Western narrative of romance is,
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.000]   I just want someone like me
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.440]   so that I don't have to wrestle with any of my crap.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.680]   Right?
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.200]   If that person looks like me, talks like me,
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.000]   acts like me, and never annoys me,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.400]   well then I don't have to deal with any of my crap.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.680]   Isn't the team an opposite, the opposite truth?
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.220]   What does any sports team do?
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.720]   They actually cherish and celebrate what?
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.800]   When someone is different than them.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.220]   They actually say, I have enormous gaps.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.920]   I cannot play every position.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.980]   So I need someone that can play a different position.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.720]   I need someone that can fill those gaps.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.620]   I need someone that has a different skill set.
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.320]   Both, man and woman, should be talking like that
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.160]   and thinking like that.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.220]   That actually, instead of us wanting someone more like us,
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.940]   we should want someone that specifically is different
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.940]   so that we can be a more rounded team
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.880]   to go on the mission God has for us.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.280]   God wants to send you on mission,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.000]   and marriage is essentially creating a team
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   for you to accomplish what he has for you.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.620]   Do you believe in that, and do you trust in that?
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.760]   Another way to think, too, is that God,
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.460]   so many of us, we think love is face to face.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.320]   If only I can find a relationship
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.420]   where we're just face to face,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.240]   and we just stare lovingly into each other's eyes,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.260]   and watch Netflix, and rom-coms, and all these things.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.380]   By the way, speaking of rom-coms,
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.500]   that's like a dead genre now, doesn't that kinda suck?
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.640]   Those were amazing back then,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.220]   and they just stopped making them.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.360]   What was that one with Rebel Wilson, though,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.280]   where they kinda spoofed it?
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   Hilarious, you should watch it.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.680]   I can't remember if it's R, though, so maybe not.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.520]   Anyways, okay.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.060]   Tangent.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.600]   But so many of us, we think that love,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.800]   or marriage, is only about face to face,
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.860]   when in reality, specifically in Genesis,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.860]   it's actually shoulder to shoulder.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.680]   It's not about looking across the aisle
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.380]   for someone to complete you or fulfill you,
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.880]   but it's actually shoulder to shoulder,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.100]   who can I go do God's work with?
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.100]   Who can I actually accomplish the mission with?
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.380]   Who actually levels each other up?
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.140]   That's who I want to join myself with.
[00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.280]   And by the way, the antithesis is also a helpful diagnostic.
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.580]   Who makes you worse?
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.140]   Who just erodes the image of God in you?
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.400]   Who absolutely just shames you
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.320]   for what you feel like your calling is,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.900]   or who you're created to be, or where you wanna go,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.580]   or the dreams God's laid on your heart?
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.580]   If you're in a dating relationship,
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.260]   and you feel like that stuff is getting sunk,
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260]   and oppressed, and kind of put down,
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.500]   you need to break up immediately, okay?
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.940]   - Amen, brother! - Thank you.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.940]   (laughing)
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.380]   You felt that, you felt that.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.940]   Glad I'm not alone, thank you.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.580]   But it's true, it's true.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.460]   Or you could say too, especially for the ladies,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.380]   this is a really helpful one,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.620]   and I guess you could do it on reverse,
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.500]   you could do it both,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.740]   but another helpful diagnostic, if you're dating,
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.900]   is say, okay, if we get married,
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.620]   and we have kids that are exactly like that other person,
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.260]   so ladies, okay, if we get married, and I have a son,
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.340]   and my son turns out to be exactly like my husband,
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.480]   does that make you cringe, or make you excited?
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.540]   If that makes you cringe,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.340]   I think you know what you should do.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.420]   But so many of us, we stay in these relationships
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.220]   for I have no idea why reasons,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.900]   when we know that person's holding us down,
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.260]   we know that person is not activating us in the spirit,
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.860]   and allowing us to go on mission together.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.180]   You know they don't make you better.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.700]   You have to ask those hard questions now,
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.260]   'cause can I just say too, by the way,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.480]   if you're not asking it now,
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.700]   it'll just get 10 times worse in marriage.
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.900]   10 times worse.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.360]   This is the time to ask the hard questions.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.420]   This is the time to make the hard decisions,
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.580]   when you are dating,
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.020]   and looking for someone to partner with on God's mission.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.200]   Point three, he then gives them a specific domain,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.660]   and job title, in what we just read.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.220]   It says be fruitful and multiply, number one,
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.540]   and then number two, it says he put them
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.460]   in the Garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.140]   What I like to say is, we're all gardeners.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.380]   We all are gardeners, according to Genesis.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.300]   What does it mean to be a gardener?
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.220]   In the actual technical definition,
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.140]   a gardener is someone who basically takes raw materials,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.940]   and then uses some of the outside resources as well,
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.320]   sun, rain, et cetera, like that.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.020]   They take those raw materials, and what do they do with it?
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.840]   They do two things.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.060]   They either one, make something beautiful, right?
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.500]   Something that's just compelling and powerful,
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   like a flower bed, or something like that,
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.380]   or, what?
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.740]   Or they make something that is nourishing and feeds you,
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.360]   agriculture, crops, et cetera.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.660]   The job of a gardener is to make something beautiful,
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.860]   or to make something that feeds you.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.340]   Now, all of us, that's a really helpful definition
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.500]   for what it means for, again, your vocation, for your life.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.980]   The question is, what is your specific garden?
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.680]   What domain has God called you to,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.460]   whether it's law, whether it's medicine,
[00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.460]   whether it's the creative arts, whether it's finance,
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460]   I don't know what it is,
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.700]   but that is a garden that you can actually worship God in
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.340]   by creating order out of chaos,
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.580]   creating something that's beautiful,
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.300]   or creating something that nourishes people,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.020]   spiritually, emotionally, physically, whatever it is.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.840]   What is your garden?
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.460]   And a helpful question when you're dating is,
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.940]   do you have the same garden as the other person?
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.820]   You don't have to have the same job as them,
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.260]   but there should be a big enough fence
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.380]   where we want to play together in here.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.180]   We wanna build together in here.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.380]   We wanna create something that God has asked us to do
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.660]   in this boundary realm.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.620]   But if you feel like you're on opposite ends of the spectrum
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.880]   or doing, you know, totally going, pulling opposite ways,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.200]   then that probably might not be a wise decision.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.740]   There's something about God that he calls them to merge,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.580]   and then what does he do?
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.100]   And then it says, he literally places them.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.560]   That's what it says, he places them in the Garden of Eden
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.520]   to work it and to keep it.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.940]   So he merges them first,
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.140]   then he places them in the garden to work together.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.420]   We are given gardens to steward,
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:38.180]   and marriage is about being on mission together.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.620]   So ask yourself what that is, what that looks like,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.300]   who that is, is that person,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.040]   maybe that person, you haven't even met that person yet,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.740]   right, or whatever it is.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   But God is calling you to be on mission.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.620]   Imagine if a team, imagine if a sports team
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.800]   just hung out in the locker room all day
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.140]   and just kind of told stories to each other.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.740]   Would that be weird?
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.580]   Right?
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:19:59.700]   Oh man, I love you, bro, I love you, bro.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.220]   Hey, you're awesome, you're awesome.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.500]   Do you think that'd be weird sooner or later?
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.260]   Probably actually sooner, right?
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.980]   Why?
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.420]   What's a team supposed to do?
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.020]   A team's supposed to go play the game.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.780]   A team's supposed to go win the championship.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.700]   But so many of us, that's pretty much what I just described,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.240]   what we actually believe is the ideal
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.260]   of romance and relationships.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.300]   Let's just sit in the locker room
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.820]   and just tell each other good things.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.060]   Now by the way, can I just be clear
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.100]   that that, as well as the face-to-face
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.780]   is the other metaphor for it, is necessary.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:33.420]   But I would consider that the glue
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.460]   and the goodness God has created for relationships
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.780]   for you to go do the bigger thing,
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.460]   which is be on mission together.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.820]   Now if you go on mission together
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.220]   without the face-to-face, then it's dry,
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.060]   it's hard, it's difficult, and without the glue,
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.540]   there is usually fracturing.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.420]   So they are meant to go together,
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.240]   but a lot of us, we are totally fine
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.020]   with just the sitting, hanging out,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.380]   and just staring lovingly into each other's eyes.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.340]   When that's more like the locker room where you prep,
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.140]   you check out the whiteboard, you run up the plays,
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.580]   then you go on into the game.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.540]   Then you go play the game.
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.700]   Then you go pursue what God has for you.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.380]   And so that's what we have to think about
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.100]   when we read Genesis and think about that,
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:18.000]   that God is giving you a garden to go play the game.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.740]   So what would that be?
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.660]   And think about, when you think about that too,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.980]   a couple helpful questions you can maybe ask yourself
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.620]   in that is just talk to the person more
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.660]   with asking them dreams, hopes, visions, et cetera.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.740]   I think so many times I hear dating relationships,
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.700]   and you'll be like, have you asked them what they wanna do
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.300]   or where they wanna be in 10 years?
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.780]   I'm not saying they have to have a perfect answer to that,
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.020]   by the way, 'cause does anyone else hate that question?
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.140]   You're, where are you gonna be in five years?
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.660]   Like, I don't know, and any answer I said,
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.340]   I definitely didn't look like that five years ago.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.740]   Now, but it is helpful in just like stirring the heart,
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.460]   stirring the mind of are they going somewhere?
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.380]   A really good word for it is trajectory, trajectory.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.740]   Are you on a trajectory that this person is on?
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.620]   Because you should be going the same direction,
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.260]   either in maturity level, in a spiritual maturity level,
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.140]   or in a vocational level, but going the same direction
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.680]   on a certain trajectory is deeply, deeply important.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.620]   And so that's what we have to ask.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.980]   Point four is this, then what we see too is that,
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.820]   what do we see with Jesus?
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.440]   That Jesus comes in the Gospels
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.540]   and beautifully shows us what?
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.940]   That we don't have what it takes,
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.580]   that we are not good enough, that we have failed,
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.600]   but what?
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.780]   His love is there for us.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.060]   He meets us in this place and He wants to know you.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.560]   Another way to think about it is those three points
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.540]   I just named, Jesus perfectly fulfills.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.020]   Have you ever thought about who's the truest image of God?
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.100]   Jesus.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.160]   He is the actual fulfiller of the image.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.220]   It even says that in Colossians,
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.560]   that He is the image of the invisible God,
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.320]   not only as an image of God,
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.760]   but He also as the truly human one,
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.700]   showed us what it's like,
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.520]   that He was the perfect divine reflection.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.680]   He was the perfect divine reflection that comes down
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.160]   and goes out towards us.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.920]   Then He doesn't go solo, He goes on a team mission
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.020]   with the Holy Spirit and the Father, constantly
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.420]   referencing them, constantly saying He needs them,
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.680]   constantly saying He needs to meet with them,
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.020]   and then what?
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.800]   And then point number three, He then reveals His garden,
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.940]   which is what?
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.020]   All of us, our hearts, our minds, our sinful nature,
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.180]   the earth, that He is the ultimate maker of order
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.500]   out of chaos in our lives, in our marriages,
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.700]   in our dating relationships, in our finances,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.020]   in all these different types of things
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.020]   that God is for us, God is with us,
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.960]   and that any place that we failed
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.080]   in being these proper divine reflections,
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.500]   He has fulfilled for us by His grace.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.760]   I think about, we can fast forward Genesis one,
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.760]   Genesis two, and then Genesis three.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.260]   What happens in Genesis three?
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.240]   The curse.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.040]   So they're given this big mandate,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.800]   they're given this big mission,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.960]   they're given this big job, and they fail.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.400]   They eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.800]   They say, I can do it on my own,
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.720]   which so many of us, we're still living that lie today.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.100]   In relationships, in our sexuality,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.240]   I can do it on my own.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.400]   And it's this whisper from Satan,
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.720]   or the Satan figure, actually, is what it is in Hebrew.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.320]   Do you know, by the way, total trivia and random known fact,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.640]   but we call him Satan, but you know that actual figure
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.200]   in scripture has no proper name, right?
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.440]   It's the serpent, or the Satan in Hebrew,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.280]   which just literally means the accuser.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.100]   Satan, we call him that, I'm just gonna call him that
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.560]   right now just for reference sake,
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.520]   he actually doesn't have a true name.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.320]   And there's actually God trying to do a point there,
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.420]   by the way.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.720]   What gets names in scripture?
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.760]   We literally actually just read it,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.720]   it's a couple verses after Genesis one, 28 and 29.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.000]   What gets names?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.800]   Anything that's created, anything that shows order,
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.580]   anything that's put in the garden.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.860]   Who's the antithesis of order?
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.600]   Who's the king of chaos?
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.800]   The accuser, the serpent, the Satan figure.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.280]   And so it's actually, I think, God, in some way,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.000]   and the writers of the scripture is kinda saying,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.880]   he is so the antithesis of chaos and evil
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.080]   that he doesn't deserve a name.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.000]   He doesn't deserve a name, because he only seeks
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.280]   to kill and destroy and steal.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   He only seeks to unravel.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.700]   His job is to breed chaos in our lives,
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.080]   in our relationships, and he does it
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.920]   almost primarily by whispering in our ear,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.800]   you can do it alone, you can do it on your own,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.700]   and you are the king of your own life.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.080]   Those are his primary tools and his primary whispers
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.720]   that he constantly is putting into our ear,
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.840]   and nowhere does it wreak more havoc than in relationships.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.960]   I don't know about you, but I mean, I had a horrible,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.360]   like my childhood was pretty horrible,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.400]   and I think about like, no one really walks
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   with the Lord in my family, right?
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.960]   My parents never got married.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.560]   You know, my mom had been to like juvenile hall,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.640]   my dad had been to prison, just a really, really,
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.520]   really pretty rough upbringing, and I look back on that,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.200]   and I'm just like, yep, rings true,
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.300]   that Satan just breeds chaos and disorder.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.240]   Like so many of us, is that not our story?
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.640]   Maybe even you had a healthy family,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.600]   but you never felt known, you never felt seen,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.520]   you felt like the pressure was insurmountable,
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.040]   you felt like you could never actually perform good enough
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.760]   for your parents to love you, or maybe it was
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   severely broken by the world's standards.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.040]   Whatever it is, so many of us, I think it would be clear
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.220]   for us to say that yes, objectively,
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.200]   we understand sin can erode relationships,
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.240]   even if we're not thinking about ours,
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.920]   but the ones above us, how it's informed us,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.080]   how it's ruined us, how it's wounded us,
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:10.240]   that it can hurt us, that have we not seen, basically,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.920]   it's funny how we just keep making the same mistakes
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.160]   generationally, is what I'm trying to say.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.040]   So many of us, have we not seen that when you say
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.240]   that you're the king of your own life,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.800]   or you make your own decisions, or you don't listen
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   to God's blueprint, you don't step into God's design,
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.520]   it does not end well, it breeds chaos and disorder
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.460]   and hurt and pain.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.240]   It's the brokenness of this word shalom in the garden,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.200]   that this order, this dance of creation,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.700]   that when you are living within God's design,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.300]   it's like a music, it's like rhythmic, it's beautiful,
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.540]   it's compelling, but there's something about sin
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.540]   that breaks the music, and just wreaks havoc on our lives.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.900]   And music is a really good metaphor, too, by the way,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.260]   that music is kind of objective in the sense of the rhythm,
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.580]   meaning it is just, a rhythm would just be constant,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.960]   a beat, right?
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.120]   It would just be going at a certain way.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.500]   We don't get to make up the music,
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.680]   is what I'm trying to say.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.600]   You don't get to make up the music.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.420]   Now, you can be creative of how you dance in the music,
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.380]   right, and it might not be good,
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.380]   we got some white people in the room, so I understand,
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.380]   but, I mean, come on, we've all seen that guy
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.300]   at the wedding, right, where it's like,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.100]   I don't think, no, no, no, okay.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:25.180]   You know who you are, you know who you are.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:31.860]   So, when music is playing, you cannot make up the music,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.080]   your job is to submit to music and dance within it,
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.660]   but you are allowed to be creative within that submission.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.980]   Again, I think that's a beautiful picture of relationships,
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.580]   God's design, that they are not rigid.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.340]   God's designed so much in our culture,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.660]   it's that God is constrictive, God is oppressive,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.700]   God is, you know, rigid.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.580]   Now, there might be restraint that he calls this to,
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.020]   and I would believe it does feel like that
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.140]   and sound like that in our culture, and it absolutely does,
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.420]   but within that restraint, there is freedom,
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:04.260]   just like someone who's enjoying dancing.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.120]   You're not saying it's rigid to not dance on beat,
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.880]   you're just saying you look stupid.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.760]   You look ridiculous, that's not how you do it,
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.860]   it's that simple.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.780]   That's not rigid, that's just almost like a law of nature,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.120]   that just music works in a certain way
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.040]   and you can be creative within it.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.920]   And so that's God's design, again,
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.040]   for relationships and for us.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.480]   One more tangent I just thought of,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.160]   and then I'll close here in a sec,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.280]   is that's actually a big point in our culture, right?
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.740]   That our culture's highest value,
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.680]   specifically with the 35 and under crowd,
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.880]   which that would be me and peers and stuff,
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.920]   would be that nothing should inhibit my freedom.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.240]   Nothing should inhibit my freedom.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.120]   That's like the highest Western ideal,
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.360]   and are we not seeing that play out
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.280]   in all these cultural battles, right?
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:52.160]   That the highest ideal in the West
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.320]   is that I should be able to do what I want,
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.840]   when I want, how I want, and anything that constricts that
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.560]   is evil or wrong or oppressive or from the patriarchy.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.520]   Right, I thought you guys just loved, okay, never mind.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:06.180]   Okay, we're gonna move on from that one, that word, okay.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:12.660]   But in fact, that's not true freedom.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:17.060]   True freedom always involves restraint at some level.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.940]   A good metaphor would be like skydiving, right?
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.700]   Now, when you skydive,
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.300]   that's like the epitome of freedom, right?
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.500]   You're just jumping out of a plane,
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.260]   flying through the air, it feels super free,
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.460]   exhilarating and amazing, there's no restraints.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.260]   Well, kind of, is there?
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.760]   What's kind of restraining you?
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.200]   A parachute.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.360]   Now, if you wanted to be a little bit more free
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.040]   'cause that kind of felt like it was getting a little tight
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.080]   and you might chafe and you wanna take it off,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.220]   what's gonna happen to you?
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.060]   You're gonna die.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.420]   So in that scenario, it sounds like restraint
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.400]   actually brings more freedom, are you tracking?
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.720]   In that scenario, it actually sounds like
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.120]   if I submit to the restraints,
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.320]   I will actually be able to enjoy this way more.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.280]   Same with sex, same with relationships, same with dating,
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.140]   same with marriage.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.060]   That when you understand God's design
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.680]   and when you understand the restraints
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.640]   he has placed in there,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.720]   you will be able to enjoy it way better.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.920]   It's actually God saying, play, enjoy, eat,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.880]   be fruitful, be multiply, this is amazing, incredible.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.000]   But within this context, you go outside of that context
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.400]   and you're just playing against the music.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.780]   God, the thing I want you to hear tonight is,
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.020]   as he's playing a music,
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.020]   are you dancing to it in your relationship?
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.180]   Are you trying to tune your ear to it every morning?
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:39.420]   What a cool way to think about prayer, by the way.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.900]   This is a time to listen to God
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.220]   and almost be a tuning fork to his music,
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.700]   his voice, his love over me.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.300]   That's what it means to live in a healthy way
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.620]   in that blueprint.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.160]   And I'll end with this.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.460]   So we get to Genesis three, the curse comes,
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.700]   and there's this really fascinating thing that shows up
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.100]   how God responds to the first human sinning
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.920]   that I think we just kind of skip over
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.900]   because we kind of just assume,
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.140]   well, yeah, we've read the rest of the story,
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.580]   of course, God's loving and kind, et cetera,
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.900]   but let's just go back a little bit, okay?
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.140]   So they sin, but by the way,
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.980]   did that not seem like they sinned in five seconds,
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.540]   anyone else?
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.220]   Like it was so quick.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.380]   He said, do not eat of the tree,
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.340]   and what'd they do five seconds later?
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.740]   They ate of the tree.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.660]   Now, God would have every reason,
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.220]   especially with that royal language in Genesis,
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   that these are the royal ambassadors of Yahweh himself,
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.220]   maybe at a high-level justice way, I don't know,
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.340]   to just go Thanos and snap his finger and they disappear,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.460]   I don't know, but he would have been justified
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.620]   in responding that way, that's what I'm trying to say.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.300]   But yet, if we hadn't read the rest of the scriptures,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.580]   I feel like you would be on the edge of your seat
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.980]   of like, what is God going to do in this moment?
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.840]   These image bearers, these royal priests,
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.500]   these divine representatives,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.220]   I mean, the representatives of the divine,
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.300]   these image bearers, they just usurped
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   and kind of went against the king.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.940]   What is he going to do?
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.860]   Now, what does he do?
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.220]   He does something very weird.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.420]   What's God's very first response
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.700]   to the first time sin enters into the world?
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.300]   What's he do?
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.260]   He asks a question.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.540]   That's his first response.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.820]   The very first time sin enters into the world,
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.500]   after he just created everything,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.700]   it was beautiful, it was amazing,
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.220]   it was awesome, and it was incredible,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.580]   the very first thing God does is asks a question,
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.460]   two actually, but why is that weird?
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.000]   God should be never asking questions, amen?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.360]   Isn't that kind of like against the,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.380]   like, isn't that not really the,
[00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.700]   like, if you're God, you don't really need
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.940]   to be asking that, right?
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.300]   Unless what?
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.140]   Unless what?
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.620]   God is maybe asking rhetorically,
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.500]   or it's actually trying to show us something.
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.340]   Now, what was the question?
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.700]   What was the very first thing out of God's mouth?
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.820]   They sin, the curse breaks, everything,
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.680]   comes into the world, and then God comes looking for them
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.020]   in the garden, asks a question,
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.220]   and the question is what?
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.380]   Adam, where are you?
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.700]   Adam, where are you?
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.460]   Now, again, do you think he really needs to know?
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.420]   Like, hey, what bush, bro, I can't find you.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.900]   Do you think he's legitimately asking,
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.260]   Adam, send me the GPS coordinates right now.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.500]   Log into my Find My Friends app
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.020]   and let me know where you're at.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.620]   No, again, unless God is rhetorically in that moment
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.500]   setting a precedent that we have to saturate ourselves in,
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   and that is God actually calling them
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.380]   back to himself immediately.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.460]   Immediately.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.700]   He's actually saying, Adam, where are you?
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.660]   Where is my son?
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.500]   Where is my daughter?
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.580]   Why are you hiding?
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.020]   Why are you hiding?
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.300]   The first response from God is actually to go look from them
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.440]   and then to call them out of hiding.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.220]   That's enormously incredible.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.620]   Like his default position to sin,
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:53.780]   that's another way you could put it.
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.700]   His default, like how his first response to sin in the world
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.660]   is to go looking for them and call them out of it.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.300]   Go looking for them, and by the way,
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.100]   he calls them by name, how beautiful is that?
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.220]   He calls you by name when he's calling you out of your sin,
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.580]   when he's calling you out of hiding,
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.100]   when he's calling you out of your shame,
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.140]   when he's calling you out of anything
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.340]   that is unraveling your humanness,
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.740]   breeding that chaos, breeding that disorder,
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.660]   he's calling you out of it.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.980]   Tonight, maybe.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.540]   Tonight.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.420]   Masturbation, sleeping with your boyfriend
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.180]   or your girlfriend, whether it's something
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.100]   that was done to you in the past in an abusive way,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.700]   whatever the shame is, whatever the behavior is,
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.740]   whatever it is, he's calling you out of it tonight.
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.380]   You can find healing tonight.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.220]   Tonight.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.580]   He says, where are you?
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.420]   And then they say we were hiding
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.020]   'cause we were naked and ashamed,
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:44.800]   and then he says a second question, which is what?
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.260]   Who told you you were naked?
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.500]   Again, it's God reiterating the primal voice
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.060]   over the human saying who told you you were naked?
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.540]   Who told you you weren't good enough?
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.180]   Who told you you were this, this, this, and this?
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.280]   I didn't, that wasn't my voice.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.380]   That's a different voice.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.300]   But that's not my voice.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.180]   The very first voice over you cries love,
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   goodness, image bearer, beloved, his.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.700]   Do you believe that tonight?
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.620]   Do you believe that God is calling you out of darkness,
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:20.500]   out of sin, out of all of these things into goodness?
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.380]   He wants to plant you back in the garden
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.440]   equipped by the power of Jesus and the Holy Spirit
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.060]   to go on mission with him.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.460]   And so I'll say this.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.320]   When I think about that moment
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.120]   and thinking about Jesus calling us out of sin
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.420]   and our darkness, I think of the story of Jesus
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.420]   where the lady is coming to try to get to him
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.260]   and touches him, and what happens to her?
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.100]   Well, two things.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.740]   First of all, how crazy is it that Jesus immediately says,
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.580]   "Who just touched me?"
[00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.580]   And he's in a crowd of a bajillion people.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.540]   So it's like, well, bro, isn't everyone kind of, right?
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.060]   But he says, "Who touched me?"
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.980]   So it shows you his awareness and his power.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.580]   And then, by the way, what's it say?
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.380]   She had been, I think, sick and bleeding for 14 years
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.580]   from what I can remember from the story.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.620]   And then what's it say?
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.060]   Upon touching her, she is instantly healed.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.020]   Instantly healed.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.660]   Now, you know what's crazy about that story?
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.160]   Before the New Testament,
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:27.100]   darkness or uncleanliness tended to win.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.380]   Now, here's what I mean by that.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.880]   I don't mean that God wasn't powerful then
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.180]   or God wasn't healing, but just even ceremonially,
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.560]   according to the Torah, if something clean
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.180]   came in contact with something unclean in the Old Testament,
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.380]   almost every single time, if they were to touch
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.860]   an unclean and a clean person or thing or whatever,
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.700]   what would win?
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.460]   Meaning would both leave clean or would both leave unclean?
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.020]   Both would be made unclean.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.660]   The uncleanliness would kind of like transpose itself, right?
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.900]   And you know what's crazy about Jesus in the New Testament?
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.980]   It's completely reversed.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   Anything that comes in contact with Jesus, what happens?
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.900]   Clean, instantly.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.780]   Instantly healed, righteous, new, beloved, good,
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.780]   simply by reaching out and touching him.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.660]   And so that's what I wanna leave you guys with tonight,
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.820]   and that's what I want you to think on
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.340]   and just sit on with this last song
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.740]   that'll be here in a minute,
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.900]   is have you first of all reached out and touched him?
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.260]   Have you reached out and touched him?
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.680]   Have you been made new?
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.740]   Because the minute you say yes to Jesus
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.780]   and all that unraveling that sin was doing,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.800]   you begin to start re-raveling in new creation.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.280]   That's what it means to walk with Jesus,
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.580]   is all you're doing is re-raveling yourself.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.640]   I know it's a weird way to put it,
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.540]   but you're re-raveling your imageness
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.600]   to be made more in the image of who?
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.040]   Him, and then when we resurrect and are fully glorified,
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.640]   that job is perfected and done.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.840]   That job is perfected and done.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.000]   That's what it means to be an image bearer
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.720]   under the submission and authority of Jesus.
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:03.220]   So have you reached out and touched him?
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.880]   And then if you have, have you been placed in that garden?
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.320]   Do you understand that mission?
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.180]   And are you on a trajectory of trying to find a teammate
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.440]   that will take you in the direction God wants you
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.480]   and make you better and be a partner
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.400]   that'll actually go on mission with you
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.500]   and not hold you down?
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.320]   Let me pray for you guys.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:23.160]   Jesus,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.800]   I just pray for everyone in this room.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.360]   Lord, thinking, just feeling that weight right now
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.220]   of the diversity of life story in this room,
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.520]   whether it's a good family upbringing,
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.000]   a bad family upbringing,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.800]   whether it's some serious dark stuff
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.760]   that's been done against us,
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.060]   whether it's some stuff that we have done
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.200]   against other people,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.280]   whether there's maybe just even like something,
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.560]   stuff that we don't feel like was crazy, bad,
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.120]   or been done against us, but we just feel numb.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.500]   We just feel like we have what we should have
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   and what we need, but we just feel like we're empty.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.740]   We just feel numb.
[00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:06.300]   And so, Lord, I just pray a blessing.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.020]   I pray a healing over everyone in this room tonight, Lord.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.040]   And as this song plays,
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.520]   maybe we shout it out as a praise to you,
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.520]   but maybe we let it wash over us as well and we just listen.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.100]   And that this song can maybe be a reminder
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.340]   of that primal voice in the garden,
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.940]   the first voice that says,
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.140]   where are you?
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.820]   You can come out of hiding.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.300]   And Lord, we thank you for the blueprint,
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.620]   that the minute we come out of hiding,
[00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   we are touched, healed, renewed, and new,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:37.340]   and then we have the blueprint.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.900]   We can continue to take steps forward
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.400]   to first of all, be on mission ourselves.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.320]   That Lord, you give us missions
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.200]   as image bearers individually,
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.300]   and that we can focus, we can point ourselves towards you,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.980]   and if you wanna bring someone to the left or to the right
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.480]   to join in on that party, then amen, let it be so.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.180]   But Lord, let us be faithful either way,
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.980]   in singleness, in relationships.
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.540]   Let us be faithful, faithful with our bodies,
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.780]   faithful with our thoughts.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.020]   Lord, let our bodies, our thoughts,
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.500]   and our hearts and our minds
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.880]   do exactly what we talked about in the beginning.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.840]   Say, this is who is in charge.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.740]   This is who is king.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.760]   Might we be image bearers and living statues going out
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.880]   where people say, oh, that's what it looks like.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.860]   That's what divine love and goodness and blessing looks like.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.140]   That's what the king looks like.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.900]   That's what who I'm created to actually be like
[00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.060]   maybe looks like, the one calling me
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.260]   into love and forgiveness.
[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.660]   So Lord, we thank you for who you are
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.020]   and what you've done for us.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.460]   In whom we pray, amen.
