1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 >> All right. Let's go Devstep. Okay. Anyone been to London ever before? It's a great city.

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,960
 Yeah. I'm going to tell a story that will give us some direction for where we're going to head tonight.

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,160
 I got to go with JP to London earlier this year in May.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,840
 There was a conference for kind of young pastors under 40.

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,040
 We got to go be a part of it with 75 other people.

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,000
 Basically we got a free trip to London, which was awesome.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,040
 It's like, hey, we're in.

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:59,520
 And so while we're there, as we prepared to go over there, as JP has shared before, he has kind of been on a journey where he's had challenges in

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
 sleeping, some heart stuff and different things.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,480
 And so different times he's just struggled to sleep.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,360
 And when you travel, that can be exasperated.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,280
 And so in the days preparing for that, this was just something that was like, hey, man, just be praying for this.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,040
 Hey, praying for it.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,360
 I'm going to be a wingman over there.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,880
 If you can't sleep, dude, I'll hang out with you.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,240
 We'll go see the sights, London Bridge, whatever you want to do.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,120
 We'll be together.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,840
 I'm in it with you.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,560
 And we'll just, you know, hang out if we can't end up sleeping.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,080
 And as he's journeyed through that, I mean, he's just like had all the different experiments where he has just tried kind of anything and

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,080
 everything that could help in that journey of sleeping from like, you know, these different teas to essential oils to just different kind of

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,200
 relaxation sleep stuff.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,080
 This is going somewhere.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,600
 So we get on the plane, go to London, get to the hotel.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,880
 Never been to a hotel in London.

26
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,480
 Let me tell you something in case you've never been there before.

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,160
 It's about this big, every single one of them.

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,440
 So we're in the room, twin beds right next to each other, like six inches from each other.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,040
 It's like this bump.

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,320
 Okay. And and we're preparing to go to bed.

31
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,040
 He gets like the tackle box of sleep stuff out there.

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,960
 And I'm like, hey, man, I'm in it.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,640
 We're with it together.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,040
 And we get ready to go to sleep.

35
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,360
 And there's an eight hour time difference.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,240
 And and so, you know, it's, hey, see you in the morning.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,560
 Good night.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,240
 And all of a sudden, all kinds of anxiety like hit me.

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,320
 My wife was eight months pregnant at the time.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,680
 And so I was like, eight months pregnant.

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,520
 Oh, my gosh, she could go into labor at any time.

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,560
 How am I going to get home?

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,600
 If you got to get home fast, I'm like checking flights.

44
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,160
 How fast can you get home?

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,680
 It's not very fast from London.

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,400
 That's not a real quick like I'll be there in an hour.

47
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,080
 It's like I'll see you tomorrow.

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,320
 So good luck.

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,680
 And and I just get hit with anxiety in this moment.

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,840
 And I'm like, I can't sleep.

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,560
 And poor JP, who's over there thinking I'm going to be here to support him.

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
 He's like already snoozing off.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,600
 I'm like, JP, are you awake?

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,200
 It's like I am now.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
 And I'm like, hey, can I try some tea?

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,040
 That's true.

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,120
 I got me on that.

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,720
 I'm sorry.

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,260
 OK.

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,600
 And so I'm like, I'm trying to get my tea.

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,960
 He's like, dude, I got you covered, man.

62
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,920
 You're in the you are in the hotel with the right guy.

63
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,200
 He's getting the essential oils out.

64
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,160
 We're like rubbing them on her.

65
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,200
 Whatever that even does.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,040
 And and I'm like, man, I'm just still can't fall asleep.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,720
 You know, I go like I'm just going to go walk around for a little bit.

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,920
 I'm like continue to just be plagued with anxiety.

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
 And you come back in.

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,880
 He's like, dude, I got you.

71
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,120
 Let me pull out the big guns.

72
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,040
 Turns on this recording of some guy who does relaxation techniques where the guy's

73
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,520
 like, relax the pinky toe, tighten the pinky toe.

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,360
 The pinky toe is falling asleep and he's different breathing.

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,280
 True story.

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,840
 All of that.

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,480
 Can't make this stuff up, people.

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,600
 And and I begin to listen to it.

79
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,920
 And in some, you know, eventually I ended up falling asleep and I was just

80
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,040
 overwhelmed with anxiety.

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,320
 The next day I remember thinking, man, what if I can't sleep again tonight?

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,200
 I was anxious even thinking about going to sleep.

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,000
 And I was just thinking how, you know, if something was to happen back home and

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 then once you kind of fall into this place of like I'm anxious about not sleeping, it

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,360
 makes you not able to sleep kind of just in general.

86
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,080
 And and it was just this encounter with anxiety that was interrupting this trip.

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,720
 And unexpectedly, honestly, anxiety, as often is the case, it's not one of those

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
 things you try to see happen or you even always anticipate happening.

89
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,160
 It just kind of like out of nowhere just grabs you.

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,120
 And all of a sudden you're like, man, I'm anxious about this.

91
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,320
 And in that scenario, it clearly had power over my ability to sleep.

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,000
 The funny thing, an interesting thing about anxiety is when you think about it, the

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,680
 level of power it has in so many different areas in our life or can have on our

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,040
 behavior is extraordinary.

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,080
 I mean, how many people because of anxiety over do I have enough money?

96
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
 Can I provide for my family?

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,760
 You know, am I going to make enough to be financially secure?

98
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,800
 They become workaholics.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,120
 How many people end up marrying someone who's not God's best or someone who's not

100
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,720
 in line with who God in the Bible, the scripture says you should marry this type

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,520
 person? They settle because they're like, dude, I'm just worried this may be the last

102
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,400
 chance that I have.

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,480
 How many people lie or are dishonest and don't totally tell the truth because they're

104
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,760
 worried about what someone else thinks about them?

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,720
 I mean, you think about the ways that anxiety some of you guys right now, you can't

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,040
 you're not even listening to most of what I'm saying because you're distracted,

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,160
 distracted over just a worry or an anxiety that is plaguing you right now, maybe from

108
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,560
 today, maybe in this room, maybe because you're like, who's she talking to right now?

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,160
 Maybe.

110
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,240
 It's affecting you right now, but the power of anxiety is reality and can have

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
 tremendous power over our behavior.

112
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,760
 And you think the great links think about all the ways that people attempt to find

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,720
 freedom from this anxiety.

114
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,200
 I mean, some of the reasons that people either turn, you know, I hate I need a glass

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,840
 of wine or I need marijuana or I need some sort of medication is just because, you

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,120
 know, I need some relief from this.

117
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,720
 Some people will turn to counseling because, hey, I need relief from this.

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,000
 Some people will turn to man, I just every time I get anxious, I just got to clear my

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,760
 head, go watch every episode of the new Stranger Things series.

120
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,120
 I need to go just numb myself through just binging on Netflix or I need to go to the

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,840
 gym, need to exercise that all of us will try to find different ways to cope with

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,760
 anxiety because we recognize, man, it can have a clear power over our thinking, over

123
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,600
 our health, over our focus, just over our ability to sleep, all kinds of different

124
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:22,920
 things.

125
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,680
 And the further interesting thing is it's it's one of those things that no one wants

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,600
 in their life.

127
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,400
 Like no one came into this room tonight and it was like, look, hey, I'll surrender

128
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,680
 everything to you, Lord, except the anxiety that I'm keeping all to myself because

129
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,040
 that's my little pet vice over here, just me and the anxiety.

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,600
 Everyone would be like, dude, if it is possible to be free from anxiety, I would

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,720
 love to know how.

132
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 And the good news is I think the Bible has a ton to say about this.

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,320
 Anxiety is not something that's new.

134
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,120
 Worry is something that's been taking place for thousands of years.

135
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,320
 In fact, it was happening in Jesus's day and age and repeatedly in scripture, Jesus

136
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,160
 and the writers of the New Testament talk about anxiety and a path towards

137
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,200
 experiencing peace.

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,480
 So tonight I want to look with you at some of the principles and truths that Jesus

139
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,520
 lays out in Matthew chapter six that provide an antidote and a solution that the

140
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,680
 more that you and I embrace, the more peace will be present in our lives.

141
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,960
 So we're going to look at Jesus's teaching in Matthew chapter six, verses 24 through

142
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,320
 34.

143
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,880
 If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Matthew chapter six, verses 24 through 34.

144
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:35,800
 If not, it will be up on the screens as we look at Jesus's teachings on the subject,

145
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,600
 what Jesus is going to lay out is really two truths about anxiety and then one

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,080
 solution to truths about anxiety and then one solution.

147
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,880
 For experiencing freedom from anxiety, which is if you take notes, you write

148
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,760
 tonight's message is experiencing freedom or finding freedom from anxiety.

149
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:03,720
 All right, we're going to start in verse 24 as Jesus launches into he gets to the

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,480
 conversation worried.

151
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,400
 No one.

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,560
 So Jesus is preaching.

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,480
 It's called the Sermon on the Mount.

154
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
 He's given a sermon.

155
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,080
 Very first sermon goes in.

156
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,840
 No one can serve two masters.

157
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,920
 Either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to one and

158
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,080
 despise the other.

159
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,840
 You cannot serve both God and money.

160
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,080
 Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you

161
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
 will drink or about your body and what you will wear.

162
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,160
 Jesus launches into the conversation of worry and he begins to address the things

163
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,520
 that his audience worried about.

164
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,560
 And he brings up something that I'm going to come back to later, but he

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,920
 essentially in saying, hey, money and what you're going to wear and what you're

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,920
 going to eat, he's addressing the things that his audience would have been most

167
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
 devoted to or the things they worried about.

168
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,480
 And he addresses the fact that there's a relationship between what you worry about

169
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,640
 and what you're most devoted to, the things that you worry about reflect, hey,

170
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,160
 these are the things that I'm kind of most committed, most devoted to.

171
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,000
 And Jesus says, hey, there's a relationship between those two.

172
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,000
 And I want you to know that there is a way to experience freedom from worry, so

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,800
 don't worry. And he addresses what his audience would have worried about to us.

174
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,640
 He would have said whatever fill in the blank, your anxieties, your worries are.

175
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,600
 But then he asked two questions that I really want to spend the bulk of this

176
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240
 first point discussing with you, and here they are.

177
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:26,920
 Isn't life more than food and the body more than clothes?

178
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,320
 Again, he's addressing an agricultural society that food is a big deal.

179
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,280
 There's no refrigeration.

180
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,880
 There's no ability to there's no food trucks, no food camels, no anything like

181
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
 that that would allow them to like, oh, there's food right here.

182
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,680
 It'd be like, oh, man, hey, I'm worried if we don't have enough food to eat to us.

183
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,080
 He would say, hey, isn't life more than getting married?

184
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,600
 Isn't life more than having enough money in the bank account?

185
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,160
 Isn't life more than driving the right car?

186
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,280
 Isn't life more than having the perfect roommate set up in life, more than getting

187
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
 into the right master's program?

188
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,240
 Not that those things don't matter and they're not important.

189
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,760
 He would just say, whatever your worries are, isn't life more than those things?

190
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,600
 And then the second question in verse 27, and can any of you by worrying add a

191
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
 single hour to your life?

192
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,960
 That in other words, Jesus asked to just really on the face, simple questions, but

193
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,600
 profoundly true and just trying to get the whole audience on the same page.

194
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,680
 Hey, let's all begin to talk about worry and let's address a couple of things.

195
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
 Isn't life more than those things?

196
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,000
 And does worry positively contribute to your life?

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,720
 Is worry helping you or hurting you?

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,480
 The answer to like, hey, can you add to your life by worrying about something?

199
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,400
 No. A lot of us have taken life off by worrying about things.

200
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
 But his point is simply this.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 The first idea is that worrying is always worthless.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,240
 And I know on the surface that seems so simple, but Jesus is beginning the

203
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,000
 conversation about worrying.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,640
 He's like, hey, let's all get on the same page.

205
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,400
 Worrying never positively contributes to things.

206
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,960
 It's not helpful.

207
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,720
 And he's beginning to help his audience by asking the question, isn't life more

208
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,120
 than that?

209
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,640
 Deflate the power of the things that they worry about.

210
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
 That's what he's attempting to do.

211
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,760
 What I mean by that, anytime that you and I worry about something, it becomes like

212
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,120
 the thing that we're so focused on.

213
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,440
 I'm distracted by I can't really even focus on what the world around me is.

214
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,200
 What's going on?

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,320
 Because I'm just anxious over insert fill in the blank, whether or not this

216
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,920
 relationship is coming to an end, whether or not I'm going to have someone

217
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,960
 to live with me or I'm going to have to move apartments after my roommate moves

218
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,160
 out, whether or not, you know, after I bombed that presentation, I'm going to

219
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,160
 get the promotion or what everyone at my work is thinking about me.

220
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,400
 Whatever we're worried about can consume so much of our attention.

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,360
 And Jesus is saying, hey, look, you're worried about things that at the end of

222
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,600
 the day, is that really all that life is about?

223
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,920
 You're spending all of your time thinking about them and time equals life.

224
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,160
 And so these things that are really not even at the end of the day, that big of

225
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
 a thing, and yet you're spending so much of your life focused on that.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
 And he's just trying to pull his audience back from the things they get hyper

227
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,600
 focused on.

228
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
 Like his audience, you'd be like, oh, you're so concerned about food.

229
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,920
 Is that all life is about?

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,560
 Like if you had all the food in the world, you never had to worry about it.

231
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,400
 Is that all you'd ever want ever?

232
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,120
 No.

233
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,280
 Maybe it's, it's around marriage or singleness and to you, he would say,

234
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,040
 look, it's life, marriage, life equals marriage.

235
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,320
 Really?

236
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,240
 No, of course not.

237
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
 Isn't life more than that?

238
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,480
 If you think life equals marriage, that's all that it is.

239
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,880
 It's because you are not married and someday you're going to get married and

240
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,960
 you'll be like, huh, yeah, this is great.

241
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,280
 But yeah, it's just that there's so much more.

242
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,520
 And Jesus is saying to his audience and whatever you worry about, he's saying,

243
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,320
 man, isn't life so much more than this?

244
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,640
 The thing that's getting all your attention, the thing that you're so focused

245
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:47,800
 on.

246
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,280
 And he's trying to deflate the power of the worry.

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,080
 Really?

248
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:58,480
 Uh, the genius here is that today counseling and psychology is still catching up to

249
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
 what Jesus did right here.

250
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,760
 Cause they do a form of this.

251
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,240
 If you ever go to counseling around anxiety and go see someone, they'll do a

252
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,440
 form where they'll attempt to deflate the power of worry.

253
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
 So I'm married to a counselor, so I'm like in counseling every single day and it's

254
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,480
 like, it's not working.

255
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,320
 And, uh, and, uh, and my wife would say, and counselors would say, there's a form

256
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,720
 that takes place where counselors will hope you do this today, where they'll

257
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,520
 attempt to just help you, uh, deflate the power of the worries that you experience

258
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
 and help you see them for what they are.

259
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,520
 And so, uh, for example, one variation of this where they're, they're essentially

260
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,720
 doing what Jesus did back then, where if you came in and you're like, man, I'm just

261
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
 so anxious, I'm going to lose my job.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,920
 And they'll just help you chase down what you're worrying about.

263
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,120
 Okay.

264
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,400
 Well, what happens if you lose your job?

265
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,840
 Well, I guess I'd have to look for another job.

266
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,520
 What happens if you have to look for another job?

267
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,640
 Well, I, you know, if I don't find something quick, I'd have to maybe get rid

268
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,720
 of my, you know, my lease on my car.

269
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
 I'd have to change it in and get a new car.

270
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,440
 What if you have to get a new car?

271
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,520
 Well, I probably have to get like a clunker cause I don't have much in savings.

272
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,080
 And what if you have to get a clunker?

273
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,160
 I guess I'd be embarrassed to drive my clunker around and what people are going to

274
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,680
 think about me.

275
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,600
 Got it.

276
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:04,920
 Okay.

277
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,600
 You're not worried about whether you lose your job.

278
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,920
 You're worried about what people are going to think about you if you drive a

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,400
 clunker and just chase it down.

280
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,160
 What if I can't sleep tonight?

281
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
 What if you can't sleep tonight?

282
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,640
 I guess I'm going to be really tired tomorrow.

283
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,880
 What if you're really tired tomorrow?

284
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,920
 I guess I'm going to be really tired tomorrow.

285
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
 And just helping chase.

286
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,960
 I mean, it's truly, I've just saved you guys like 125 bucks an hour.

287
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,480
 You're welcome.

288
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:31,800
 Okay.

289
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,440
 That's just free.

290
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,040
 But they're doing still today.

291
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,120
 Psychology is catching up to a Jesus 2000 years ago was going, Hey guys, let's just

292
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,640
 all see the things that we're worried about for what they are.

293
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,280
 Not that they're not important, but they're certainly not the epitome of what life is

294
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,760
 all about.

295
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,600
 Despite the fact that they're getting all of your attention and you're spending so

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,760
 much of your life focused on.

297
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,560
 And he continues.

298
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,800
 Further asked the question of verse 27 of, Hey, just worry, add to your life.

299
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 And, um, even medical studies have come out and said, I mean, it's clear.

300
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,960
 Worry has a detrimental effect on the human body.

301
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,320
 Charles Mayo, the Mayo clinic.

302
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,480
 If you know that it is said this worry affects the circulation, the heart glands, the

303
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,560
 entire nervous system.

304
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,680
 I've never known a man who died of overwork, but I've known a whole lot who have died

305
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,600
 of worry.

306
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,280
 So in Jesus's words, he's just saying, Hey, worry is never helpful.

307
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,480
 As we launched into this conversation, let's all get on the same page about that.

308
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,680
 Worry is worthless.

309
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,520
 But here's what's interesting.

310
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,680
 Knowing worry is worthless.

311
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,240
 It's kind of worthless.

312
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,320
 It's like, oh, yeah, in other words, me being like, Hey, worry is worthless, stop it.

313
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,760
 Nobody's like, all right, all my worries are gone, I'm done, let's close in prayer right

314
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,040
 now.

315
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,600
 No one would say that.

316
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 Shut it down.

317
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,520
 But the good news is Jesus doesn't stop there.

318
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,240
 He continues and says, Why, as followers of Christ or Christians, you and I don't have

319
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,040
 to experience worry.

320
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,320
 And he continues the conversation.

321
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 As he just is bringing us to the fact that it is possible to experience freedom from

322
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,520
 worry. And he goes into an illustration.

323
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,120
 Here's what he says.

324
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,240
 Verse 26.

325
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,440
 Look at the birds of the air.

326
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,720
 They do not reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly father feeds them.

327
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,640
 Are you not much more valuable to God than a bird?

328
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,280
 And why do you worry about your clothes?

329
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,040
 See how the flowers in the field grow, they do not labor or spin.

330
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,000
 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon and all of his splendor was dressed like one of

331
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,040
 these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and

332
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,240
 tomorrow is thrown in the fire, will he not much more clothed you?

333
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,080
 Oh, you have little faith.

334
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,760
 Sad note, Jesus points out there's a relationship between the size of your faith

335
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,440
 and the size of your worry.

336
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,240
 But you have little faith.

337
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,520
 So do not worry saying, What should we or what should we drink or what should we

338
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,960
 wear for the pagans, the pagans, a person who doesn't have a relationship with God, a

339
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,160
 pagan is a person who doesn't have a heavenly father as God.

340
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,400
 It would be the rest of the world, if you will, the pagans run after all of these

341
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,320
 things, their focus, they're pursuing all of these things, and your heavenly father

342
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,360
 knows that you need them.

343
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,040
 Jesus says that you and I, as Christians, are different.

344
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,480
 One of the reasons you do not have to worry is because you have a heavenly father.

345
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,840
 You're not like the rest of the world who doesn't have anyone watching and looking

346
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,320
 out for the back as Christians.

347
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,720
 Who have a heavenly father, who are children of God, the Bible teaches have someone or

348
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,440
 have a heavenly father who's caring, who's providing, who's concerned and is promised

349
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,520
 to look after their needs.

350
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,680
 And he's inviting you, you do not have to worry.

351
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
 He's not saying don't care.

352
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
 He's not saying don't try.

353
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
 He's not saying is not Jesus version of like, dude, it's all chill.

354
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
 Just, you know, keep it cool.

355
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,000
 It's not saying that he's not saying don't work hard, fill out the applications, follow

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,120
 up, be diligent, do all of those things, work really hard.

357
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,400
 And then at the end of the day, he's saying, I'm inviting you to sleep well and not worry

358
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,240
 because you have a heavenly father who's promised I will provide for your needs, not

359
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,520
 your wants, your needs.

360
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,720
 The second idea from the text that Jesus lays out is that you, if you're a Christian, you

361
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,360
 do not have to worry because God will meet your needs.

362
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,680
 God has promised I will meet your needs.

363
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,040
 There's a guy named John Owen who lived a couple hundred years ago, was a famous pastor,

364
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,800
 if you will. And he just said, hey, worry for a Christian is irrational because it is

365
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,680
 as a Christian, you're someone who says, God, I trust you with all of eternity, with all

366
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,840
 of my life, all of my sin.

367
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,080
 I trust you with all of it, God.

368
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,760
 I just don't trust you with Thursday.

369
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,400
 He would say that's irrational.

370
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,400
 It doesn't make sense.

371
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,960
 It's a human experience that grabs all of us, but it is an irrational thing.

372
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,600
 I trust you with it all, just not tomorrow and not this.

373
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,520
 At this, I'm afraid you're going to mess up or this may be too big for you to handle.

374
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,280
 You just said it is irrational because they believe their heavenly father is a provider

375
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,800
 who's promised to meet the needs that they have.

376
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,160
 Jesus in this passage four times says, do not worry.

377
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,640
 Hey, you don't have to worry.

378
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
 Don't worry.

379
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,920
 Don't worry.

380
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,480
 Do you know what the most commanded?

381
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,320
 Most repeated command, I'm sorry, in all of the Bible is.

382
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,280
 Do not fear.

383
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,360
 Don't be afraid.

384
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,920
 Don't worry.

385
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,320
 Fear not.

386
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,160
 More than hey, don't get drunk more than hey, don't sleep around more than hey, don't

387
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
 get angry and hit people more than any of those things.

388
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
 Do not fear.

389
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,320
 Three hundred and sixty six times.

390
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,640
 Do not fear.

391
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,360
 Do not fear.

392
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,120
 Think about that.

393
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,040
 That is one for every single day of the year, including leap year.

394
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,440
 It's as though God is very clearly trying to communicate a message.

395
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,680
 I do not want my people to live in fear.

396
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,520
 They're going to face uncertainty.

397
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,160
 Life is not going to go the way that they always want it to.

398
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,120
 Life is hard.

399
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,440
 And in this world, they will have trouble.

400
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,200
 But God says I am inviting them to a life where they can face future uncertainty and

401
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,840
 not be afraid because they know their heavenly father is working to provide for their needs,

402
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,720
 not their wants every time.

403
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,360
 But he has promised I love you.

404
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,280
 I am for you.

405
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,520
 You do not have to worry.

406
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,720
 I will provide for you.

407
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
 I've got your back.

408
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,240
 Don't let anxiety.

409
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,480
 Push you into the same self-centered, I'm concerned about getting more for me, me, me,

410
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,920
 me, that the rest of the world, that's pagans are running after because you have a

411
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,360
 heavenly father who said, I got you, I will provide.

412
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,240
 Even by saying, do not worry, he is implying.

413
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,040
 I got you.

414
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,880
 By saying, do not worry, he's implying I got you.

415
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,000
 And if he's not, he's not a good God.

416
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,920
 What I mean, if he's saying, hey, don't worry, but I don't really don't have you

417
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,440
 covered, he would not be a good heavenly father.

418
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,520
 You wouldn't say someone is a good friend if they did that to you.

419
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,680
 Like if we tonight we were going, we're going to dinner afterwards, we're leaving.

420
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,840
 Oh, yeah, we're going to Matito's.

421
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,080
 Great.

422
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,320
 We're walking out and you're like, oh, man, I forgot my wallet.

423
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,480
 I'm like, hey, don't worry about it.

424
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,600
 We go to Matito's, get there, we're eating food and the bill comes up and he's like

425
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,560
 one check, two checks, two checks.

426
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,880
 You would look at me like, what you said, don't worry.

427
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,280
 And if I said you thought I was going to pay for you, no, I didn't mean I was going

428
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:40,680
 to pay for you.

429
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,240
 I just want you to be distracted and, you know, discouraged while we're eating the

430
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,800
 meal right here.

431
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,120
 Have fun washing dishes.

432
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,560
 That's great.

433
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,120
 You wouldn't be like, you're a great friend.

434
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,920
 You'd say, what is wrong with you?

435
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,840
 You're a terrible friend.

436
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,840
 What kind of God says, hey, don't worry, and then says, but you're on your own.

437
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 Does that make any sense?

438
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,080
 He's clearly saying, I got you.

439
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,040
 I'm promising to provide for your needs.

440
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,080
 No, no one would say there's a such thing as a good parent, a good father or a good

441
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,000
 mother who can meet the needs of their children and doesn't.

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
 No one would say that's a good parent.

443
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,640
 Think about the lengths that parents go to to provide for the needs of their

444
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,280
 children. Think about the needs that people go to any dog moms in the room in

445
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,600
 here and dog dads.

446
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,080
 There are more dog dads in here.

447
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,160
 I am I'm concerned.

448
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,280
 So this is a new thing, I think.

449
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,160
 Let me just address this here for a second.

450
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,480
 The dog mom phenomenon feels new.

451
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,800
 Here's what I mean by dog mom.

452
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,360
 I don't just mean you have a dog.

453
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,320
 I mean, you see this dog as your child.

454
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,480
 And so you're you know, you had a Halloween costume for them.

455
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,000
 You are every time you go into the grocery store, you're like, oh, my gosh, get to

456
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,200
 get a new toy for Fido.

457
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:08,520
 OK, and you see this this child as like you're are you see this dog as your child?

458
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,240
 You're like, no, you had it right the first time.

459
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,200
 And this seems like a new phenomenon.

460
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,640
 I mean, I mean, there's a girl on our team.

461
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,080
 The lengths that she goes just to like, you know, here's a sweater and and I don't

462
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,040
 want to call names, Emily.

463
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,280
 But she I mean, she gives her dogs middle names.

464
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,240
 If you are giving your dogs middle names, there's something wrong.

465
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,480
 OK, and you are dismissed.

466
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,000
 OK, now, let's see the links that you go to to provide for her dogs.

467
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,200
 Now, let me ask you a question.

468
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,600
 Do you think that she loves her dogs more than God loves you?

469
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:52,960
 Do you think that whatever dog mom, you know, the best in the world has a greater

470
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,440
 amount of love for her dog than God has for you?

471
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,880
 Of course not.

472
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
 He's already proven it.

473
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,360
 But the links that he'll go to to provide for your needs, including your ultimate

474
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,680
 need, includes giving the life of his only son dying in your place.

475
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,520
 That there is no greater amount of love someone could have, there is no even

476
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,360
 ability for us to comprehend the love that God has for us, the Bible says.

477
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,240
 It's literally something you have to pray, God, will you help me to comprehend more

478
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,520
 of it? Because you're such you're a God who loves me so much I cannot on my own

479
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,160
 comprehend it. That's a feature to chapter three.

480
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,400
 But if we were honest.

481
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,680
 Most of us often fail to believe that.

482
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,800
 Struggle to believe that, man, God, you really you love me more than any human

483
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,560
 love I've ever seen expressed towards a child, to the dog.

484
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,520
 And the God who's there says, I got you, I promise I will provide for you.

485
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,920
 And let me clarify again, it is not I will provide for all of your wants, he

486
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,840
 promises I will provide for your needs.

487
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,000
 You may think you know what you need, God actually knows what you need.

488
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,880
 And he promises I will provide for your needs, I got you.

489
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,800
 It's clear, I mean, even if you just look back in your own life, if you're

490
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,640
 anything like me, that I'm not always the best determiner of, hey, I really want

491
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,320
 this, God, this would be great, would you please give it to me?

492
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,240
 And then years later, I look back and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I'm so thankful you

493
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,160
 did not give her to me or job to me or school.

494
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,200
 I mean, think about it, think about the people maybe in your past boyfriend,

495
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,800
 girlfriend, relationships that you had, a college that you were just begging, God,

496
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
 please let me get into.

497
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,960
 And he didn't answer that prayer.

498
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,920
 And you look back and you're like, man, I'm so thankful that that ended up not

499
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:49,120
 being the way it went, that we're not great at determining what we want or what

500
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,080
 is even best for us.

501
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,320
 And not great at determining what we need, but the God who's there says, I know what

502
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,000
 you need and I promise I will provide it like I provided by sending my son to die

503
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,640
 on a cross.

504
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,880
 I got you.

505
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,800
 You do not have to live like the rest of the world.

506
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,360
 So Jesus's worry is worthless and worry for Christians is irrational because we

507
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,880
 have a heavenly father who has promised, I will provide for my needs, for your

508
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,320
 needs.

509
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,960
 A heavenly father who's in control, who loves you and is working for your good,

510
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,600
 as it's been said many times, we do not know what tomorrow holds as Christians,

511
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,400
 but we are the only people in the world who know the one who holds tomorrow.

512
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,960
 Christians do not know what tomorrow has for you, for me, for any of us, but we're

513
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,720
 the only people on this planet who know the one who holds tomorrow.

514
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,320
 And every tomorrow after it, and he said, I got you, you can trust me.

515
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,200
 I got you.

516
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,400
 And then Jesus goes into what I think is one of the most profound truths.

517
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,520
 That I believe if you begin to practice and put it into practice, you'll

518
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,960
 experience increasing freedom from anxiety inside of your life, where he lays

519
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,560
 out a verse that candidly, I think some people, if you were raised in church, you

520
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,880
 have heard so many times.

521
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,600
 And you've never actually paused to think about what Jesus is actually saying here.

522
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,480
 And so it's a verse, you're like, oh, yeah, I heard that one before.

523
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,920
 But if you pause, look at it.

524
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:27,120
 There's an incredible principle, an antidote to the anxiety that exists in a

525
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,760
 lot of our lives.

526
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,480
 Here's what he says.

527
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,600
 But seek first.

528
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,360
 Hey, I don't want you to have to worry, you don't have to worry, Heavenly Father

529
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,240
 loves you, he will provide, but here's what you need to do.

530
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,640
 Seek that same word, seek is translated desire first or prioritize first embrace

531
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,480
 as the very first thing.

532
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,880
 Put on the throne of your life, if you will, this is the first thing.

533
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,560
 God's kingdom.

534
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,800
 What is what that's a weird world there, what does that mean?

535
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,520
 Heaven, what do you mean by that?

536
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,440
 The word kingdom all throughout the Bible is essentially God's reign, God's rule,

537
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
 God's will.

538
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,800
 Prioritize first place as first in your world, in your life, God's agenda.

539
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,640
 For you.

540
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,080
 And his righteousness and all of these things will be given to you as well.

541
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,080
 Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow, we'll worry about it, say

542
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,400
 self, each day has enough trouble of its own, take a day at a time, day at a time.

543
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,120
 What is you saying?

544
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,160
 Jesus says, hey, I want you to desire your first place as first on the heart and

545
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
 throne of your life.

546
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 God's kingdom, God's agenda for your life, God's will for you.

547
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,680
 Both his revealed will in the Bible.

548
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,480
 And his revealing will as it unfolds in front of you.

549
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,680
 And his sovereign plan unfolds in front of your life.

550
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,600
 Embrace first God's agenda for your life, in other words, Jesus says, don't let

551
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,640
 there be any competition for whose agenda is in first place, yours or God's.

552
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,000
 All of us came in this room, we got an agenda for your life or you have one, I

553
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,280
 got one for my life. It doesn't involve cancer.

554
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,280
 It doesn't involve, you know, having a losing a child.

555
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,080
 It doesn't involve being single for years and years and years.

556
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,320
 I got an agenda for my life.

557
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,960
 I got a will that I want to see happen.

558
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,080
 And Jesus says, place as first in your life, God's agenda above your own.

559
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,200
 Prioritize first God's agenda above your own and you'll experience peace.

560
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,400
 You will begin to experience peace.

561
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,080
 Here's why this is so relevant and think about it.

562
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,320
 Remember we talked about devotion.

563
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,960
 He's saying be most devoted to God's will for your life.

564
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
 God's agenda, not yours.

565
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,680
 And you'll experience peace.

566
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,960
 Because what you are most devoted to determines what you worry about, be most

567
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
 devoted to that. What does that mean?

568
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,000
 I mean, think about your worries.

569
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,640
 Here's what I know about my words, I'll talk about me.

570
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,000
 I worry about my wants, about my agenda.

571
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,800
 I'm not worried that God's going to mess up his plan.

572
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,120
 I'm not like, God, you're out there and I just think you may have made a mistake

573
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,920
 yesterday and all that. I'm worried he's going to get it wrong by my standard.

574
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,880
 Not by God's.

575
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,120
 I worry about my wants.

576
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,760
 I worry about getting my agenda fulfilled.

577
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:22,440
 And he says, look, I want you to place as first importance or embrace first, not

578
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,680
 your desire for your life, David, but God's plan and God's agenda for your life.

579
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:34,840
 Because like I said, I worry, essentially my worries are like, hey, I'm not going to

580
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,960
 get everything that I want.

581
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,040
 That's the things that I worry about.

582
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,760
 Like, I'm not worried that I'm not going to get everything that I want.

583
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
 Which is crazy.

584
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,920
 And you worry about you not getting the things that you want.

585
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:54,280
 And it's crazy, I say, because the reality for all of us is you're not going to get

586
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,400
 what you want all of the time, every time for the rest of your life.

587
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,560
 It just is not going to happen.

588
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:05,200
 It hasn't happened already, unless you're like 30 seconds old.

589
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,840
 You will not get, you're going to live the rest of your life.

590
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,000
 You're not going to get everything that you want.

591
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,920
 And so we worry about not getting everything you want.

592
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,280
 You're not going to get everything you want.

593
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,120
 So here's what you can have.

594
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,400
 You can either have not everything that you want in life and worry or not everything

595
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,640
 that you want in life and peace.

596
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,360
 You're going to not get everything you want both ways.

597
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,000
 That's just true.

598
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,200
 You came in or not, you're going to leave.

599
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,760
 Sorry.

600
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,480
 I hate to burst the bubble, but you're not always going to get everything that you want

601
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,000
 in life.

602
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,160
 And so Jesus says, you can either have worry or peace.

603
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,680
 God, things are not going the way that I wanted them to.

604
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,200
 I trust you.

605
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:50,880
 God, things are not going the way that I saw them going as it relates to, you know, my

606
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,480
 dating life and lack thereof.

607
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,400
 But I trust you.

608
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,640
 And I'm trying to trust you more.

609
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,400
 Will you help me?

610
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,320
 That he says, will you begin to place as first on the throne, God's agenda as it

611
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,000
 sovereignly unfolds before you?

612
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,720
 God, I trust you.

613
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:19,040
 In case you're still not following me, he brings up something he mentioned 20 verses

614
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,080
 earlier, 20 verses earlier.

615
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,800
 He alludes to the same idea when he says, this is how you should pray.

616
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,880
 You guys probably remember this.

617
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,800
 If you grew up in church on the Lord's prayer.

618
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
 Hey, let me teach you guys how to pray.

619
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,840
 You want to know how to pray?

620
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,280
 And he brings up the very idea that we're talking about.

621
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,720
 When you pray, you say our father in heaven, holy or hallowed is your name.

622
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,880
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

623
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,960
 What does he mean by earth?

624
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,400
 That means in my world, on the dirt that I walk in, in my life, your will, your

625
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,760
 kingdom come, your agenda for my life before my own, your will be done in my

626
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,720
 earth, on the dirt that I live and walk on.

627
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,720
 I'm embracing that as the first thing and the first priority, and I'm asking you to

628
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,920
 bring it about in my life.

629
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,240
 Jesus illustrates this exact idea about what does it look like?

630
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,480
 You begin to experience peace by just saying, God, Hey.

631
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,280
 You know how badly I need this job.

632
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,440
 And I don't know what I'm gonna do if I can't afford to make rent.

633
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,080
 Will you please help me to get this job?

634
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,040
 And if you don't, if your will is something else, I trust you.

635
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,960
 I trust you.

636
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,120
 Your kingdom, your agenda before my own.

637
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,520
 This would be on my agenda.

638
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,120
 Let's make no mistake.

639
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,400
 Let me be abundantly clear.

640
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,480
 But if that's not in your agenda, I trust you.

641
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
 Jesus models this exact idea.

642
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,120
 In the only moment in scripture, we're told that Jesus was overwhelmed looking at

643
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,960
 future events.

644
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,040
 There's only one time.

645
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,440
 It's in the Garden of Gethsemane where he's hours away from being crucified, and

646
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,080
 we're told that he was overwhelmed with sorrow as he looked at the future.

647
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,560
 And in that moment, he expressed exactly what we're seeing.

648
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,760
 God, let this not happen, but not as I will, but you will.

649
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,320
 He says this in Mark chapter 14.

650
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,200
 Verses 34 and 36, going a little further, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed, if it

651
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,880
 is possible with this hour pass from him, Abba, Father, he said, everything is

652
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,760
 possible for you.

653
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,840
 Take this cup from me or don't make it so I have to go die on a cross.

654
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,920
 Yet not what I will, but what you will.

655
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,080
 That I'm placing above my own desires, your will for my life, God.

656
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:39,160
 And if you will begin to practice that, you're going to experience peace on the

657
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,200
 big things in your world, in your life.

658
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,040
 God, my mom just got diagnosed with cancer.

659
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,080
 I'm overwhelmed.

660
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,520
 What's going to happen?

661
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,040
 Lord, will you please not allow her to have anything other than a healthy, fully

662
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
 healthy and fully restored body?

663
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,560
 But if that's not the story you're writing, I trust you.

664
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,680
 I mean, what other option do you have?

665
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
 I guess worry.

666
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,160
 You're not going to thwart the plan of God.

667
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,400
 Again, it's like one of those things, even this idea of being like, God, look,

668
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,840
 hey, you know how desperately I want to have children and I'm afraid that maybe

669
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,200
 that's not going to be in the cards for me.

670
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,080
 And God, I can't even imagine that being the case.

671
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,680
 And so I'm struggling to trust you, but God, if that's your will, I trust you.

672
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,200
 Will you help me trust you more?

673
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:28,920
 I trust you.

674
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:39,280
 The idea of even what I'm saying is hard because just like what I mentioned

675
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,640
 earlier, it feels like we're giving up control.

676
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,360
 Like, God, man, I'm just, I'm giving God control back.

677
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,600
 Newsflash.

678
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,120
 You don't have control.

679
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,040
 And neither do I.

680
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,760
 So you're not giving anything up.

681
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,240
 You're either going to have no control and peace or no control and worry.

682
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,480
 You're going to have no control either way.

683
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
 You get to choose which one.

684
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,520
 And Jesus is saying, I'm inviting you to have peace in your experience.

685
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,200
 People even use the phrase like, hey, I struggle with control.

686
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,320
 That is like saying, hey, I struggle with, um, with x-ray vision.

687
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,360
 That is a myth.

688
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,840
 You have never had control.

689
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,200
 You will never have control.

690
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,880
 There's only one person who has control.

691
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,320
 That's God.

692
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,360
 That's like me saying, I really struggle with sovereignty.

693
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,960
 That is a myth.

694
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,000
 And God who's there saying, hey, you have no control.

695
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,680
 You never will.

696
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,480
 I have control and I love you.

697
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,960
 I'm for you.

698
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,720
 You can either have no control and anxious or, and worry or no control and peace.

699
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,480
 You decide.

700
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,720
 I had a friend who was recently going through and he had, um, started his own

701
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,480
 business and through some accounting errors with his accountant, he owed the

702
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,560
 IRS tons of money.

703
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,080
 He was overwhelmed with like, man, I'm afraid that I'm going to lose this

704
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,440
 house.

705
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
 I'm going to lose my house.

706
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,600
 I'm going to lose my job.

707
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,680
 I'm going to lose my company.

708
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,360
 I'm just like, I mean, he was overwhelmed with anxiety and he began to just pray

709
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,160
 this prayer like, God, I don't want to lose my house.

710
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,880
 I don't want to lose my job.

711
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,920
 I don't want to lose me all that I own.

712
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,520
 But if that's what you're doing and that's what you want, I trust you.

713
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,320
 I don't understand why that would be what you want, but if that's what you

714
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,240
 want, I know you love me.

715
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,680
 You proved it by dying in my place and I trust you.

716
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,000
 I'm trying to trust you more.

717
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,640
 Please don't let that happen, but I trust you.

718
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:30,320
 I'm not going to thwart your plan, but I can't experience peace.

719
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,440
 And the God who's there is inviting you on the small stuff.

720
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,520
 Maybe you're just anxious over like, Hey, you know, I mean, just, we all get

721
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,960
 anxious about the most petty things.

722
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,600
 Like, um, I just broke up with my girlfriend and I think she's going on

723
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,400
 other dates with a guy.

724
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,560
 And I'm like, Oh my gosh, I can't believe she's going on other dates with a guy.

725
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,040
 That's unbelievable.

726
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,800
 What if they end up getting married?

727
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,600
 I thought she was the one for me.

728
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,400
 We can all just get distracted and overwhelmed and just practicing like God.

729
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,920
 If that's your will, I trust you.

730
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,120
 I trust you.

731
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,720
 I don't know what's going on in your world and in your life right now and

732
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,200
 then across the board, I could, we could go every single person in here.

733
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,880
 And today, anxiety attempted to grab ahold of you.

734
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,080
 And the God who's there saying, if you will begin to replace your agenda with

735
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,680
 God's agenda, you'll experience peace.

736
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,760
 What I know put in my notes of the third point from tonight is you will relieve

737
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,280
 your worries by replacing your agenda for God's.

738
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,800
 You will begin to relieve your worries by replacing your agenda for God's agenda.

739
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,160
 The apostle Paul years later would pick up on Jesus's exact teaching where he

740
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,120
 would say this, do not be anxious about anything.

741
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,720
 But in every situation, no matter what you're facing, pray.

742
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,920
 And petition, which is ask God.

743
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,880
 It's saying the same thing.

744
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,760
 With Thanksgiving, present your request to God.

745
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,840
 That's the third time he says the same thing in different words.

746
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,760
 Pray, talk to God.

747
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,480
 Petition, tell God what you need.

748
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,680
 Present your request to God.

749
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,920
 Tell God what you need.

750
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,600
 He's very repetitive.

751
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,720
 When you're anxious, here's what I want you to do.

752
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
 Talk to God.

753
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:22,600
 And the peace of God will transcend, which transcends all understanding will guard

754
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,160
 your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

755
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,520
 Do you know what he's implying there?

756
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,080
 The only way that you're going to have peace when you tell God that stuff, when

757
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,200
 you bring your requests to God, is if you believe that God is in control and he's

758
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,960
 working for your good.

759
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,920
 You're not going to have peace any other way.

760
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,920
 The verse clearly, and Paul clearly is saying like, hey, when you're

761
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,800
 overwhelmed, pray, tell God, hey, this is what I'm overwhelmed.

762
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,560
 This is what's going on.

763
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,680
 God, will you please change this?

764
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,600
 And if not, I trust you.

765
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,040
 And you will experience peace.

766
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,560
 You can wake up tomorrow.

767
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,440
 And if you begin to do that, and some of you, you need to do this tonight.

768
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,640
 You need to do it right now.

769
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,200
 You need to verbalize it.

770
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:03,080
 There is something powerful about when you speak the words, God, I trust you.

771
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,600
 It does something to your heart.

772
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,440
 And so you may need to leave.

773
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,840
 You may need to, after this is over, go find a place by yourself, just in your

774
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,080
 car.

775
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,600
 God, you know how badly I want whatever.

776
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,200
 God, you know how scared I am about whatever you fill in the blank.

777
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,200
 And please don't allow that to happen.

778
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,800
 But God, if it does, I trust you.

779
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
 Will you help me trust you more?

780
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,200
 And there is power even in verbalizing the words that I trust you.

781
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,560
 I'm struggling to trust you, but I trust you.

782
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,320
 Will you help me trust you more?

783
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,520
 And you will begin to experience peace.

784
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,240
 As you face uncertainty.

785
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,120
 Let me close here and I'll invite the band to come back up.

786
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:56,280
 I, um, over the past year, this has become so real to me.

787
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,280
 Last fall, we discovered that we were pregnant.

788
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,040
 We were going to have another child and we were so excited.

789
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,840
 And then in early December, about 10 weeks in, after we had already done a,

790
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,400
 you know, a test around the baby and discovering that we got a phone call at

791
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,360
 930 on a Wednesday night, and it was a doctor who said, Hey, I need to talk to

792
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,960
 you and your husband.

793
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,480
 The test results came back and we're so excited you're having a baby girl, but it

794
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,400
 also came back and there's a decent chance that she's going to have a

795
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,360
 chromosomal disorder.

796
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,080
 And there's a 90% chance that she'll die before she ever gets born.

797
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,800
 And if she is born and she has this, then she will have immediate heart

798
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,720
 transplant and heart surgery right there.

799
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,360
 And she'll live the rest of her life with severe complications.

800
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,480
 She'll never have the ability to have children herself.

801
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,720
 She'll have physical implications because of this defect.

802
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,080
 And she'll require medical attention the rest of her life.

803
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,680
 And it was like a bomb went off.

804
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,560
 And I know most of you guys don't have kids and someday you will, and it's going

805
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,120
 to be awesome.

806
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,920
 It's the greatest thing ever.

807
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,240
 But in that moment, it's like, it's like a bomb.

808
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,320
 By that, I just mean like the, you know, we've all seen the scenes in the movies

809
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,600
 where your ears are ringing and everything's going in slow motion and

810
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,960
 you're just trying to grab your thoughts.

811
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,280
 And that led us on a nine month journey.

812
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,400
 We wouldn't know, she told us, every day gets a little bit better.

813
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,280
 If she survives, that's a great thing.

814
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,600
 And for the next nine months, but it would be nine because we wouldn't know

815
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,200
 until she was here.

816
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,400
 It just drove us to embrace this like I've never embraced it.

817
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,320
 And this wasn't some like preaching thing and you got to do this.

818
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,680
 It was like, God, this is life.

819
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,240
 We don't want our daughter to die.

820
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,320
 Will you save, will you spare our baby girl?

821
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,440
 And if that's not what you want, I don't understand why, but I trust you and I'm

822
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,320
 trying to trust you.

823
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,560
 Will you allow her to be healthy?

824
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,800
 I mean, all of a sudden you can imagine if you're in ministry, you're like, how

825
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,680
 am I going to afford all the different medical attention for the rest of them?

826
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,400
 I'm in ministry.

827
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,920
 If that's what I, if that is your will, God, I'm going to stop it.

828
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,240
 I trust you.

829
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,200
 What option do I have?

830
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
 Help me to trust you more.

831
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,280
 And everything came into focus.

832
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,080
 We prayed our prayers and cried lots of tears and prayed a lot more.

833
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:23,960
 And I wish that I could say like, Hey, every moment in those nine months, it was

834
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,520
 one where we just said, God, Hey, we trust you.

835
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,360
 I can't, I don't even know that I can say majority of them.

836
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,280
 A majority of our life was filled with moments.

837
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,640
 I trust you, but I can't say this.

838
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,600
 Every moment with peace was every moment where we experienced peace was one.

839
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,560
 We just said, God, we trust you.

840
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,040
 Your agenda comes before my own and I don't understand why you would do that.

841
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,320
 But if that's your will, your will be done.

842
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,360
 I trust you.

843
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,840
 And, um, June 29th, our daughter was born and she was healthy and I think God was

844
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,800
 growing my faith.

845
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,040
 I think he was going, Hey, David, do you trust me?

846
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,560
 And I hope that I would say yes, had things not gone the way that they did.

847
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,600
 And I'm not foolish enough to stand up here and be like, yeah, and I would have.

848
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,840
 But I do know.

849
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,960
 That if I'm going to experience peace, it's going to come by just opening up my

850
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,160
 hands and they're already open.

851
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,800
 Let's be honest.

852
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,320
 We're trying to grab for something that's not ours.

853
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,560
 And he's saying, will you trust me?

854
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,680
 And if you do, you'll experience peace.

855
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,040
 I don't know what you're walking through in this room, but I know the God who's

856
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,200
 there.

857
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,800
 He loves you.

858
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,000
 He will provide for you.

859
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,640
 He's promised to meet your needs.

860
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,080
 And he is working for your good and he is your heavenly father.

861
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,560
 And he's inviting you.

862
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,680
 Will you trust him?

863
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,880
 I want to pray and I want to invite you to do something.

864
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,240
 If you guys would just bow and just close our eyes and pray.

865
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,760
 And I want, if you were in the room right now, you just close your eyes and you are

866
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,960
 walking through something where you are anxious.

867
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,160
 It could be something big.

868
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,080
 It could be something small.

869
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,640
 It could be anything and everything in between, but you know that there's just

870
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,800
 something gripping at your heart.

871
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,880
 I'd love to pray for you.

872
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,680
 And so if you're in the room right now, I want you to close your eyes.

873
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,720
 I want you to pray for me.

874
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
 I want you to pray for me.

875
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
 I want you to pray for me.

876
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
 I want you to pray for me.

877
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
 I want you to pray for me.

878
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
 I want you to pray for me.

879
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,720
 I want you to pray for me.

880
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
 I want you to pray for me.

881
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,720
 I want you to pray for me.

882
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
 I want you to pray for me.

883
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
 I want you to pray for me.

884
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
 I want you to pray for me.

885
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
 I want you to pray for me.

886
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
 I want you to pray for me.

887
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,720
 I want you to pray for me.

888
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,720
 I want you to pray for me.

889
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,720
 I want you to pray for me.

890
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,720
 I want you to pray for me.

891
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,720
 I want you to pray for me.

892
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
 I want you to pray for me.

893
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
 I want you to pray for me.

894
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,720
 I want you to pray for me.

895
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,720
 I want you to pray for me.

896
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,720
 I want you to pray for me.

897
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
 I want you to pray for me.

898
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
 I want you to pray for me.

899
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
 I want you to pray for me.

900
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,720
 I want you to pray for me.

901
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
 I want you to pray for me.

902
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,720
 I want you to pray for me.

903
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,720
 I want you to pray for me.

904
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
 I want you to pray for me.

905
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
 I want you to pray for me.

906
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
 I want you to pray for me.

907
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
 I want you to pray for me.

908
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
 I want you to pray for me.

909
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
 I want you to pray for me.

910
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,720
 I want you to pray for me.

911
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
 I want you to pray for me.

912
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,720
 I want you to pray for me.

913
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,720
 I want you to pray for me.

914
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
 I want you to pray for me.

915
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,720
 I want you to pray for me.

916
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
 I want you to pray for me.

917
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:15,500
 The God of all peace would raise their awareness of you in their life.

918
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,820
 Their awareness that you're working for their good, that you haven't forgotten them, that

919
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:26,020
 you've promised to provide for them, that you're crazy about them, that you are in control.

920
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,300
 I pray that you would be more real than the fear in this moment right now.

921
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:38,520
 In the moments as they leave here, would you eclipse any of the fear, of the sadness, of

922
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,760
 the circumstances in their life and be bigger than those things?

923
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,760
 And I don't even fully know how to best ask for that.

924
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,800
 But I pray that you and your spirit would just flood their hearts and minds with peace

925
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:59,160
 and you would guard their minds and hearts with peace that only comes from you, the Prince

926
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,560
 of Peace.

927
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,040
 Father, for friends who need to leave and they, tonight, need to just verbalize, God,

928
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,040
 I trust you.

929
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,800
 Will you help me trust you?

930
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,360
 And will you pour down favor on just my friends in the workplaces and the relationships that

931
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,640
 they have and all that they do?

932
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,640
 Would they honor you and would they, above everything, trust you, no matter the circumstances

933
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,640
 that we face?

934
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
 We love you.

935
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
 We worship you in song.

936
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:23,640
 Amen.

937
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:33,640
