00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 (Music)

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Hey, it's good to be with you guys. My name is JP, Jonathan Picluda.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And I'm just traveling through this series.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And like one thing about me is, man, I love gifts.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 That's not a hint. Don't buy me or anything.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 But that's my love language is gifts.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And so I like to buy gifts.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 We tend to, you know, express to others our love language.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And so one thing I love like Christmas time, you know, or birthdays.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And anytime there's a chance to get or receive, give or receive gifts.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And so at Christmas time we had our young adult Christmas party.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 That's our staff Christmas party at my house.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And so what I did is I wanted to do a gift exchange.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And so I just went and got gifts for everyone there.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And then we did that deal where you draw numbers.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 You know, there's a lot of things to call it.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I'll call it politically correct, rob your neighbor or something.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And so everybody gets a number.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 You guys know the rules.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Like one gets to go again at the end.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 So one goes first, then two, then three.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And you can steal.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And with three steals, then the gift is locked after three steals.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 You guys know the game?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Okay, good.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And so we play.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And so, you know, as you're sitting there, you probably played the game.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You're sitting there and you're kind of looking at your gift.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And you're like, hey, am I going to use this gift or do I hope to lose this gift?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And what happens is people start selling their gift.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 They're like, hey, Kelly, man, I don't know if you noticed, man, this thing is a juicer.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Look, it's really neat, you know.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And, hey, you know, you mentioned you need a juicer.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So they can go and have one more shot, you know.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Or they go, oh, no, no.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And they start hiding it behind them.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Like, no, you don't want it.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 It doesn't look very cool, you know.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And they're trying to keep the gift.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So some of them want to keep the gift.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Some of them want to lose the gift.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And they're thinking, hey, will I use the gift?

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But I played my game with a twist, okay, because that's what's fun.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 So here's what we did is I had a special gift in there that had a consequence tied to it.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And what it was was it was this Christmas inflatable yard art, okay.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And if you got it, you had to keep it up through January all the way to February every day, okay.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 That's what you had to do.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And so I told them that.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I said, hey, here's the deal.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 There's one gift in here that you may not want.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 And if you get it, you can't get rid of it.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So if you open that gift, right, now I'm telling you what it is.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 If you open that gift, you're stuck with it.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And so everybody's kind of nervous because nobody wants to keep the Christmas yard art.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Oh, and by the way, it wasn't just Christmas art.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 In fact, let me show you the incredible yard art that it was.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I think we'll show you.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Neat how that works, right.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And so it was just to give you a little flavor.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Like some of you are like, oh, no, that's cool.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 It's a nutcracker.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 No, it's not.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 It's a redneck nutcracker, okay.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Got a nice little beer belly here, all right.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Got a snowflake tattoo over here.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Missing some teeth.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Got the redneck mustache.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And can't forget the can of beer to celebrate Christmas, okay.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So if you get the redneck nutcracker, you've got to keep it up all the way until February.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And nobody wanted to get that gift, right.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And so I see them kind of nervous.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Like, man, I don't want to get that one.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Low and behold, my dear friend Laura Elmore, who served on our staff at the time, she gets that gift.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 She unwraps it.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Oh, to her demise.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Her husband is also there, John Elmore, which I think is ironic because he heads up our recovery ministry and was an alcoholic, you know.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And so he's got the redneck nutcracker with the beer in front of his house all the way to February.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And he's like, okay, man, I don't know if I can do this.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And then he's like, yeah, sure, I'll do it because he's a gamer.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And so I tell you that because tonight as we move through quarter life crisis, we're going to talk about something that the scripture calls a gift.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 But I think so many of us hope to lose the gift instead of use the gift.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And that gift is, ready, singleness.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Scriptures, the Bible, God, the creator of the heavens and the earth through his servant Paul called singleness a gift.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 He called being single a gift.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And I don't know that we fully take advantage of that gift that the creator God has entrusted to us for at least a season because we're constantly living in some future season.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And I think we really miss out on all that that gift has to offer.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And so I don't know if you're here and your mom is constantly asking you things like you don't want to be married, you know.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And you're like, hey, mom, some of you are nodding your head.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 You're like, mom, it's not up to me, you know.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Or maybe you're starting to think, maybe that whole 30, that's a good idea, you know, maybe CrossFit, maybe that's my problem.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Maybe I need to do CrossFit and I'll meet someone special.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Or you're thinking, man, I'd be married if I had more money or you're wondering, when will I ever find the one?

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 There it goes. He's going down.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 There we go.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 You're thinking, maybe I'd be married or when will I ever find the one?

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 When will this happen, God?

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Or maybe you're here and you're like, man, how do I let him know I'm interested?

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 And you spend a lot of your time wondering, how do I let him know I'm interested?

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Or maybe you see it as a gift.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Maybe you're like, dude, I don't know what you're talking about.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Singleness is a gift. It's awesome.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And you're abusing the gift.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 You're thinking, hey, man, I'll take this gift that God gave me for a season and I'll use it for me.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 That's right, I'll use it for me and it's going to be fun and I'm going to jack with people's hearts.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And I'm going to drag people along.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And I'm going to play the physical game and I'm going to experience as much pleasure as I possibly can outside the context of what God intended because I don't fear God.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 So how can we use this gift that the Lord has entrusted to us for a season?

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 As we move through this text, we're going to be in First Corinthians, Chapter seven.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 We're going to talk about seeing singleness as a gift.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 We're going to talk about the reason you're single, which was the title to the emailer.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And so if you follow us on Twitter or you have signed up for the emailer, you may have gotten that.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And some of you I've heard that that rubbed you the wrong way.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It says we're going to tell you the reason you're single.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Oh, we are indeed not just we, but the scripture actually.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And so stay tuned for that.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 As we move through the scripture, we're going to talk about lastly, a season of singleness for some of you.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 What does that look like?

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We're going to be in First Corinthians seven.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 This is Paul's letter to the church in Corinth, which was an incredibly messed up place.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But we can draw hope from that because Paul in his letter, he actually addresses them as saints or if you have the new NIV, a holy people.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And so these this this place where these terrible things are happening.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 OK, there's a dude who's sleeping with his father's wife.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 There's men who are going out with prostitutes.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 There's people who are getting drunk at communion.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 OK, they're seeking the party, even in church.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And Paul says, hey, you're a holy people.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And as he addresses this, this holy people, almost 2000 years ago, he addresses this topic of singleness.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And he has some really specific commands for them that I believe we can apply to our lives today.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I'm going to start in verse six and then later on a jump to verse 32.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 OK, so that's where we'll be in First Corinthians seven.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I hope you're encouraged.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 He says this. I say this as a concession, not as a command.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And so as I read that, I'm tempted to think it refers to the verses before.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But but read it like this as a concession, not as a command.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I say this. I wish that all of you were as I am.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 This is Paul who is single saying, hey, it is my desire that you were as I am.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It's not necessarily God's desire, but it is my selfish desire.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 I say this as a concession, not as a command.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But each of you porch has your own gift from God.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 One has this gift. Another has that.

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Now we see this idea that that our status.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Whether married or single is a gift from God.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Now to the unmarried and the widows, I say it is good for them to stay unmarried as I do.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry.

145
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Paul writes. God preserved the scripture.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 For centuries that we might read it today and learn from it here at the porch is one reason.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And so the first point that I bring before you is challenging you to see your singleness as a gift.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 My first point is seeing your singleness as a gift.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And so this is not the gift that we want to use. This is the gift.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 This is the gift so often that we want to lose.

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 We hope that God would send us to another life stage.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And so it's really interesting because I see this all the time as I meet with a lot of you.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And I have experienced it myself as I was single in Dallas.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's like if we're single and we're not being asked out, we just hope to be dating.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And if we're dating, then we hope to be married.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And so often I meet with people who are married who just hope to be single again.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And it's very cyclical.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's like basically we just can't be content in the life stage that we're in.

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 We're constantly longing for another life stage.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And some of you are like, "No, I'm dating and I just hope to stay dating."

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Some of you are nudging your boyfriend right now. He's talking about you.

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 [Laughter]

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And that's not right either because as we've talked here many times, dating exists for the sole purpose of marriage.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Dating is actually an extra-biblical idea. You can't find it anywhere in the Scriptures.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 There's really only two seasons. There's single and then there's married.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Or betrothed, I should say.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And that's the closest we get to dating is being actually engaged.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 But we've kind of introduced this idea of dating and then a whole other flavor of seriously dating.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And all that it actually does is slow down this process that God has intended to actually be married.

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And so you see our generation continuing to delay that season of marriage longer and longer and longer.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Because what we like to do, we like to play married.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And that's dating.

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We like to pretend to be married and we call that dating.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 "Hey, you're cute. I enjoy spending time with you.

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Hey, you want to pretend to be married for a couple months, maybe about a year and a half or something?

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 We just play house?"

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Let me talk to you for a second about the presence that my children get.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 I've got three kids. Weston, 20 months. He's 20 months old.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And then Presley's seven. Finley's five.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And I watch the gifts that they give and I find it ironic.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 The gifts that they get, rather. I find it ironic.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Because what they get is these gifts that are all replicas of a future season in life.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Let me explain.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Like Weston, he gets a toy lawnmower.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 What we do is, he's a kid, right?

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And so even with our kids, we kind of push them into living into some future life stage.

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 "Hey, why don't you pretend to be an adult?" Weston at 20 months. And mow the grass.

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And so then my girls, Presley and Finley, they get a kitchen.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So they can play house.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And so it's like, "Okay, you guys pretend to be house."

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And Presley's like, "Okay, I'm the mommy. You're the daddy."

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 I'm like, "That's weird. Stop that."

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And so then what they'll do is they'll get these baby dolls.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And they're obsessed with baby dolls. My daughters.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And sometimes my son. I'm sad to say.

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 But my daughters, they're obsessed with baby dolls.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And so one day when Finley was three, she's walking around.

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 She has this baby doll stuffed up her shirt.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I'm like, "What are you doing?" She's like, "I'm breastfeeding."

201
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I'm like, "Don't ever say that word again!"

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 "What? Where did you hear that?"

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 "You better lose that term."

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's like, "Girl, no. Be three."

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 "No, you're not. No! No! Stop!"

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But we're always... And you know what? It's cute when you're three.

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It's not so cute when you're 33.

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It's cute when you're three when you play house.

209
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And you're constantly trying to live in a season that you're not in.

210
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 But when you're 33, it's less cute.

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 When you're playing house.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And you're constantly living in a season that you're not in.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And so Paul is saying singleness is a gift.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I want you to know marriage is a gift too. It absolutely is.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Marriage is a good thing. Proverbs 18.22 says,

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 "He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord."

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 But I think we read that and we miss the context.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 We read that and we think, "And he who does not find a wife finds wrath from the Lord."

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And it doesn't say that. It doesn't say you're not the favorless.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 It's not like God has forgotten you or forsaken you.

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Because the scripture also actually says that singleness is good.

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Marriage is good and singleness is good.

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 It says that they're both good.

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 So if we read it in context, now we can go to verse 28.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 1 Corinthians 7.28 it says, "But if you marry, you have not sinned." Paul writes.

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 "And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned."

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 "But those who marry now will face many troubles in this life."

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 "And I want you, and I want to spare you this."

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Literally, troubles in this life translates tribulations in the flesh.

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 "But those who marry will face many troubles in this life."

231
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And Paul, the apostle Paul, he's looking you in the face and he's saying,

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 "I just want to spare you of this."

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Or at least, as he goes on, to say, "Prepare you for this."

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 "Make sure you know what's coming, that you're going into this eyes wide open."

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And so it's interesting because we tend to elevate marriage so much in the church.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But is it not ironic that the apostle Paul, the greatest missionary to ever live, was single?

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 He was single.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And he said, "It's great. It's good. I wish you were as I am."

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 You know who else was single?

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Jesus was single.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Is Jesus not the most eligible bachelor on the planet?

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I know some of you are like, "Can I laugh at that? Or is that blasphemous?"

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Just track with me.

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Women like, I've heard, men who have power and whatnot,

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 He's God, alright?

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 So He can do anything. He spoke things into existence.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It seems like He's a pretty eligible bachelor.

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And He was 33 years old, so He moved past that time when folks in this culture would have gotten married.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 But He chose not to take a wife because He was on a mission.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 And He didn't have that distraction of marriage.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 He is our example.

252
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And so marriage is a good thing, but not at the expense of singleness being a good thing.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Singleness is also a really, really good thing.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And so, so much, I think, of our quarter life crisis is us trying to live in some different season

255
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 instead of living in the season that God has entrusted to us.

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And so those of you here that are playing married,

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I have a word of caution for you.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Not I, but the Lord.

259
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Be careful.

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 The Bible really gives you two options in dealing with lust.

261
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Option one is to make war with it.

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 To remove that which is causing you temptation.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 To cut off the hand and gouge out the eye, which seem like pretty extreme things to me.

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But those come from Jesus Himself.

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 That you would wage war with lust for the sake of pursuing a greater good in God.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 The other option is marriage.

267
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 For Paul writes, "It's better to marry than to burn."

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Now it's interesting to me that he doesn't write, "Hey, listen, if you're burning with passion, just go ahead and look at some porn."

269
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 "Hey, listen, if you're burning with passion, go ahead and masturbate."

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 "Okay, take care of that. Take matters into your own hands. Get rid of that passion. It's all good."

271
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 But he doesn't do that. He gives you two options.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 He says, "Hey, you can wage war with your lust or you can get married."

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And what do we do? We play house and put off marriage and continue to play with our lust.

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And continue to experience the pleasures that were never intended to happen outside of marriage.

275
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Why? Because we don't trust God who says, "Hey, I'm not trying to rip you off. I'm trying to set you free. I'm trying to give you life."

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 "Do you not look at statistics? Do you not see the direction you're headed? I have something for you that's better."

277
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And we say, "God, we don't trust you."

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Like if we're just real honest, "God, we just don't trust you. We'd like to do it our way."

279
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Verse 9, "But if they cannot control themselves, they shouldn't marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion."

280
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 This burning with passion or giving in to the fire of passion will add to your quarter-life crisis.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Much anxieties. Much anxieties.

282
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 But God says, "No, you have two options. You can use the gift of singleness that I've entrusted to you."

283
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Or you can move to another season.

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And moving to another season may not be up to you.

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So if you find yourself single, then your option, your only option that honors God is to use it.

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 My brother-in-law, this Christmas this past year, we go to my wife's family's Christmas exchange,

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 which they're notorious for giving awful gifts.

288
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I'm just being honest.

289
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And my brother, not my in-laws, they give great gifts, but their extended family gives awful gifts.

290
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And my brother-in-law's uncle, he gives him this little package, he opens it, and it's a stopwatch.

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Which is a bad enough gift as it is, because what do you use a stopwatch for?

292
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 We have an iPhone, it's got a stopwatch.

293
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 But it doesn't work. It's a broken stopwatch.

294
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And so my brother-in-law is just like, "Okay, this just kind of adds to the awful gifts."

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And everybody's like, "What do I want to do with this stopwatch?"

296
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And I kind of heard his uncle say that it was valuable, and it was plastic, so it didn't look valuable,

297
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 but I heard him say it was valuable.

298
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And so my brother-in-law, I was like, "Hey, maybe it's worth something."

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's like, "You want it?"

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And I was like, "Sure, I'll take it."

301
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 But why?

302
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Because I know that his uncle desires to give him good gifts, right?

303
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 His uncle loves him, he cares for him.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 If you give him a stopwatch and it doesn't work, it's got to be for a reason.

305
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 So he gives it to me.

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I look on eBay.

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 It's going for about $150.

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 So I sold it.

309
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It was worth something.

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He didn't know it.

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 He was taking it for granted.

312
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 It was useful, and he didn't realize it.

313
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And there's a risk whenever you have something that's really useful and you don't understand how to use it.

314
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Singleness is a gift, and it's useful.

315
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And the way that you use the gift is you trust the giver.

316
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 See, I was like, "Hey, man, I trust your uncle would give you something good.

317
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 He would desire to give you something good.

318
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I trust this thing has a value.

319
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 For some reason, he gave it to you."

320
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And in the same way, as you find yourself single, you can trust the one who gave that gift to you and ask him how you might use it.

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Verse 32, "I would like you to be free from concern."

322
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 The word "concern" is literally "anxieties."

323
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Paul writes, "I would like you to be free from anxieties.

324
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs, how he can please the Lord.

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, how he can please his wife.

326
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And his interests are divided.

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs.

328
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit.

329
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, how she can please her husband.

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord."

331
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And so Paul, in this small paragraph, gives us two profound, important lessons.

332
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 One, he is trying to convince you something that you will not believe, but I'm going to say anyways, because it's my duty as I exegete the scripture.

333
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Marriage will not solve your problems.

334
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Marriage is only going to add to your problems.

335
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 There are problems in singleness.

336
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 There are more problems in marriage.

337
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And if you don't like that truth, you're like, "What did he just say?"

338
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 It's straight from the scripture.

339
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 That's what Paul is saying.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Okay?

341
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It's a good thing, but you're choosing your problems.

342
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And with marriage, you're choosing more problems.

343
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 I'm not trying to talk you out of it.

344
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I'm just trying to teach accurately what the scripture says.

345
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And the second one.

346
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So first one is marriage actually puts a magnifying glass on your problems.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 And the second one is actually my second point this evening.

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And it's this, that you are single for a reason.

349
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Paul is going to show you now the reason that you have found yourself single for at least a season.

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 He says, "No, there is a reason you are single."

351
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And so if I could go back personally to being single, and not that I fantasize about this at all,

352
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 but as I think about it and spend time with you, I'm telling you, there are things I would do dramatically different.

353
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I would take an international trip at least once a year to go and to take the gospel to the dark places of this earth.

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 I might use all my vacation days doing exactly that.

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I would see my place of business as a mission field.

356
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I would lose my job sharing the gospel, or at least I'd want to.

357
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 I would want to be there and understand that God has hung a light exactly where he has, and that I would be there for a purpose.

358
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I would belong to a church. I would become a member there. I would serve there. I would give there.

359
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And I would come under the authority of the elders there, and I would say,

360
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 "Would you guys help me find what gifts the Lord has entrusted to me so that I can unleash those gifts for the kingdom?"

361
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I would not think of Christianity as this idea that I would add to my life,

362
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 but I would think about it as the biggest thing about my life,

363
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 processing all decisions in regards to how they would bring glory to God, the creator, the maker of heaven and of earth.

364
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I would ask him constantly, "Lord, how do you want to use my life to bring your kingdom here to this place?

365
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 What do you want to do through me? I believe you want to do incredible things today.

366
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 For the eyes of the Lord go to and fro, looking for hearts that are fully his.

367
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Lord, I pray that you would find me so faithful that you might use me to change this place."

368
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 If I was single, again, I would get trained.

369
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I would become biblically equipped, biblically literate.

370
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 I would learn the scriptures. There's classes here that are free, or very close to free,

371
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 and they're equivalent of seminary classes.

372
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 You can go and sit under the teachings of great Bible teachers so that you know this book through and through

373
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and how to apply it to your life so that you can go into any situation to bring about the resolve that God desires through his scriptures.

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You can do that now, for you will never have more time.

375
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 It's so frustrating when married people say that, and it's so true.

376
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It can frustrate you, but your frustration does not change, make it any less true.

377
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I love you, and I'm telling you, I'm pleading with you, you will never have more time for the rest of your life than you do right now.

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And so he just says, "Focus."

379
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It seems like what he's saying in this small text is like, "Selfish singleness is not an option. It's your ministry."

380
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Like, you cannot be selfishly single. There's some of you here that are like, "No, I like to be single. I don't want to be married. I want to play the field."

381
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 That's not an option. That's not an option.

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 That's what the world does, so if you want to do like the pagans do, that's what you can do.

383
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But if you're here and you're like, "Hey, I claim Christ," you don't have the option of playing the field and keeping my options open

384
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and, "Hey, I'm going to kiss her tonight and her tomorrow and take her out and jack with her heart."

385
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 That's not an option for you. "Hey, I'm going to have some friends with benefits."

386
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 No, there are no friends with benefits in the kingdom.

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 There's no friends with benefits in the kingdom.

388
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Okay, that's not how we do, man.

389
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 That's what the pagans do, man.

390
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 You're submitted to a greater spirit than the spirit that is in the world.

391
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 You say, "Hey, I will pursue a spouse or I will live radically for the kingdom of God."

392
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Those are your two options. You choose.

393
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 If you know Christ and you're here, and I know a lot of you don't, but if you're here and you know Christ, you choose between those two options.

394
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Those are your two options.

395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Todd walks into my office, my first year on staff.

396
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Todd's the senior pastor here. And he says, "Hey, JP."

397
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 "Yes, sir." "How's your ministry doing? How's your ministry going?"

398
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I instantly had this response. I'm like, "Hey, man, let me tell you about it, Todd."

399
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 It's great. Young adults are getting into community groups and watching lives change.

400
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 This dude trusted Christ. This girl trusted Christ.

401
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 This girl came from this background and changed everything about her life.

402
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 God did that in her. It's incredible to think we're going to Haiti, Todd.

403
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 We're going to Brazil. We're going to Africa. It's amazing, these trips.

404
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 He looked at me confused and he said, "No, bro. How's your ministry going?"

405
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 He points to a picture of my family.

406
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 He says, "Dude, that's your ministry. That's your primary ministry. This ministry comes first."

407
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I'm here with you guys, and it is a joy and an honor to be with you.

408
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 But the truth of the matter is my wife's at home. She's tucking our three kids into bed.

409
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 She's singing "Jesus Loves Me." She's reading them Bible stories.

410
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 She's changing that diaper for you. She's giving him the bottle.

411
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I'm here, and I'll get home long after they're tucked in.

412
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 I'm grateful she's there, but that's my primary ministry. This is my secondary ministry.

413
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 If I don't do that well, I'll never do this well.

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I am a man with a divided heart. That's the truth.

415
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 That's what Paul is saying.

416
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I am less available to you than I could be, and I'm grateful.

417
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 But that's the truth, and that's what he's saying.

418
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I just ask you, can relationships distract you from God?

419
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Everyone needs to be nodding their head, north and south.

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 There are two kinds of people here.

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 There are folks that came in, they're singing, "You will love me."

422
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 They're singing, and they're worshiping God, and they're here, and they're focused on God.

423
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 I'm like 1 Corinthians 7, and they're like, "Oh, great, man. Paul's letter to the church at Corinth."

424
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 They're taking notes, and I know where he's going, singleness.

425
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 This is going to be awesome. They're hanging on to every word and the illustrations.

426
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 They're like the Nutcracker. "Ha, ha. I love it. I'm learning. I'm teaching."

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 And then there's others of you that are like, "Oh, man, she's right there.

428
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 Oh, man, he's behind me."

429
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 And you haven't heard a word I've said. You don't even know I'm up here right now.

430
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 You're the ones not laughing right now, because you're in this daze of, "Okay, she wore the dress.

431
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Oh, my goodness. Should be illegal."

432
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 "Okay, I didn't get to shake her hand or meet and greet, but maybe afterwards I can go up and say something."

433
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 "Lord, give me the courage to say something."

434
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 That's the other half of you. Like you don't even know you're in church right now.

435
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Okay? You're still figuring this thing out.

436
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Relationships can indeed be a distraction.

437
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 I'm telling you, I've had to back out of the last two international trips that I was on.

438
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Not for any emergency, like for a dance recital and something else. I don't remember what it was.

439
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Something family-related. I was like, "Hey, it doesn't make sense for me to go on this trip."

440
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And I had to ask for my commitment back.

441
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 But I sat down with my single friend the other day. I hadn't seen her in a while.

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 She actually helps me prepare these messages. Week in and week out, we sit together and talk about what the Scripture is saying.

443
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 I'm with a group of people. My friend Cheryl, she's 40 years old and she's single.

444
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And we sit down and I just said, "Hey, Cheryl, I haven't seen you in a while."

445
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And she goes, "I know, man. Seven weeks, six different places, six different airports, three different countries."

446
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 "I've been traveling."

447
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I'm like, "Oh, tell me about it."

448
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And she always has these magnificent stories of God working.

449
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And she's doing the things that some of you only dream about doing. Why?

450
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Because she's using her singleness.

451
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And you know what? Some of you...

452
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Okay, this is the crazy part.

453
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Some of you would feel sorry for her.

454
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And I think, "What a joke."

455
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 Because she would never say this because she's humble.

456
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 But I'll tell you, she should feel sorry for you.

457
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Because you're wasting your singleness.

458
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 She's using her singleness.

459
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 You hope you lose your singleness.

460
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And she's using every day of her singleness to bring the kingdom here.

461
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 When I get up there, I hope I get her house.

462
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Or one like it.

463
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Right?

464
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 God's using her in that way.

465
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And you can be used in that way as well.

466
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 She's not distracted by a husband or desperation for one.

467
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 She says, "Hey, if God gives me that, great."

468
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 "But until then, I'm single."

469
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 "So I'll use it."

470
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 "If the Lord entrusts me with one, awesome."

471
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 "But until then, I'll leverage the gifts that He gave me."

472
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So why is she single?

473
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 The same reason you are.

474
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 You ready? Here's the reason you're single.

475
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It's directly from the scripture. It tells you why you're single.

476
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Verse 32.

477
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 "To be concerned about the Lord's affairs, how you can please the Lord."

478
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Verse 34.

479
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 "To be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit."

480
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Verse 35.

481
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 "You are single so that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord."

482
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 How novel of an idea.

483
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 The reason that you are single.

484
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 The reason that you're single is so that you can say,

485
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 "Lord, here's my life. Take it and use it for your glory."

486
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 "That I can go and learn more about you."

487
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 "Everything about you."

488
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 "So that all my few little moments I have here on the earth were all about to die."

489
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 "God can take you and use you by about to die."

490
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 I just mean in comparison to how long you're going to be with Him.

491
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It's like that long.

492
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 But a vapor, James says.

493
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And we can say, "God, use my life."

494
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Last week we talked about narcissism and wasting your life on you.

495
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And I think there's no greater way to waste your life than to live in desperation for another season.

496
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Desperation. I'm not talking about just a desire, a God-given desire.

497
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 I'm talking about an obsession.

498
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And so why are you single? Is it because you're tall?

499
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Or short?

500
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Or fat?

501
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Or skinny?

502
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Or ugly?

503
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Or too pretty?

504
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Or have BO?

505
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Maybe.

506
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Maybe those are some of the circumstances.

507
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But the reality of it is you're single so you can seek Him.

508
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 So that you can use your life to find Him.

509
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And so don't be so desperate to lose the gift that He's given you.

510
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Use the gift that He's given you.

511
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 But what if you're here and you desire to be married?

512
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 You have a God-given desire to be married. Let's talk about it.

513
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Verse 36.

514
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 "If anyone is worried that he might not be acting honorably toward the virgin he is engaged to,"

515
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 "and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry,"

516
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 "he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should indeed get married."

517
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And so my third point is simply this.

518
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 That some of you are here and you're single for a season.

519
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Some are single for a season.

520
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 So you're here and this is a momentary kind of stop.

521
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 It's not like a call to singleness.

522
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 It's not a terminal gift of singleness or a chronic gift of singleness.

523
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 It is a singleness for a season.

524
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 It's going to turn into another season.

525
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And in fact, that's most of you in the room.

526
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Most statistics out there, the most conservative one I could find,

527
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 would say that about 80% of you will be married one day.

528
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So the vast majority of you.

529
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And so this is simply a season for you of singleness to which I say,

530
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 the Apostle Paul would tell you, "Use this season well."

531
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Use it well.

532
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 And so if you are dating someone, act honorably toward one another.

533
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Your quarter-life crisis would be a much bigger crisis

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 if there was a pregnancy or an STD or a breakup after a sexual encounter

535
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 because those breakups are absolutely the hardest.

536
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 But your quarter-life crisis is even greater

537
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 when you pursue another idol other than the Lord.

538
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And you act as though you are not afraid of Him

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 by the things that you give yourselves to.

540
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And so I'm just telling you that sex is--

541
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 absolutely believe this--

542
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 sex will keep you in the wrong relationship too long,

543
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 and it will keep you from the right relationship.

544
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And I see it all the time.

545
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 All the time I see it.

546
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I'm not just saying that.

547
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I'm not trying to scare you to follow God.

548
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 I don't need to scare you to do anything.

549
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 I'm telling you there is a way that He created us to do,

550
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 things He created us to do so that we would find life in them.

551
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 So don't trust a dude if he says he loves you

552
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 and his hand's moving toward anything other than a ring box,

553
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 as it's been said.

554
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And if you do want to get married,

555
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 for those of you--I want to talk with you for a second--

556
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 those in the room right now that desire to get married,

557
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 I would tell you now is the time to train to be married.

558
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 I think so often young adults don't realize

559
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 they are becoming more of what they already are.

560
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 You're becoming something.

561
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Like great spouses, great husbands and wives are not just born.

562
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 They are created, and they are created when they're single.

563
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 I've said this before,

564
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 but I've never met any couple with marriage problems.

565
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 And I meet couples all the time

566
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 who come to me with so-called marriage problems,

567
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 but they're always single people problems

568
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 that they brought into their marriage.

569
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 They're always problems that they had before their marriage

570
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 that they brought into marriage

571
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 that marriage put a big old magnifying glass on

572
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 and said, "Hey, look at this problem right here."

573
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And so now is the time to deal with that.

574
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 How do you deal with that?

575
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 You get a really dysfunctional roommate.

576
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 You live in community.

577
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Okay, you resolve conflict.

578
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 You talk to people.

579
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 You date in a way that honors God.

580
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Why is it important to date in a way that honors God?

581
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Because if you're not,

582
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 what you're telling the person that you're dating

583
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 is you are an adulterer.

584
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Let me define that.

585
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 An adulterer is someone who has sex

586
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 with someone they're not married to.

587
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Here's why I say that.

588
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Listen closely.

589
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 I have a sexual desire.

590
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I know the Lord doesn't want me to express it in this way.

591
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 I do not care.

592
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 I'm going to follow my urges.

593
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Can I tell you something?

594
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Trust me on this.

595
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 You will have those urges.

596
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 He or she will have those urges for another person

597
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 after they're married to you.

598
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 They've already told you

599
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 they're committed to following those desires.

600
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Do you see what I'm saying?

601
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 They said, "Hey, I do not fear God.

602
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 "I follow my urges.

603
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 "That's why I want to have sex with you right now

604
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 "outside of marriage."

605
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Later on, we're going to be married,

606
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 and when I have those urges again,

607
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 I'm going to follow them.

608
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 If they tell me to have sex with someone else,

609
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I'm going to follow them.

610
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 I'm telling you that now.

611
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 I'm trying to.

612
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 I'm jumping up and down,

613
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 waving my arms, saying, "I'm an adulterer.

614
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 "I'm an adulterer.

615
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 "I'm an adulterer.

616
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 "You want to marry me?

617
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 "Marry an adulterer."

618
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 That's what they're teaching you.

619
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And you're like, "Man, he just made that up."

620
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 No, I didn't.

621
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 I see it all the time

622
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 over and over again.

623
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And so I don't think we realize

624
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 that you're becoming more of what you are.

625
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I had this call with this girl the other day, last week,

626
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 and she wanted to live with her boyfriend,

627
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 and she just asked me if I thought that was wise.

628
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And I thought she was wise for asking, honestly.

629
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I appreciated the question,

630
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 and that she would reach out.

631
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And so we just talked through.

632
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 She wanted me to give her the secular statistics,

633
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 which all would say, "That's a bad idea."

634
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I say all.

635
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Any credible one would say,

636
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 "That's a really, really bad idea."

637
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 But I just said, "Hey, I'm not interested

638
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 "in talking about your behavior.

639
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 "Let's talk about your belief."

640
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 And she said, "Oh, yeah, yeah.

641
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 "No, you don't understand.

642
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 "I have this dream that he and I,

643
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 "we're going to go to church together,

644
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 "and we're going to take our kids to church,

645
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 "and we're going to belong there,

646
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 "and it's going to be awesome."

647
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 And I go, "Cool.

648
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 "Can I ask you a question?"

649
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 She's like, "Yeah."

650
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 "Do you belong to a church right now?

651
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 "Are you a member at a church right now?

652
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 "And do you go there, and do you serve there,

653
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 "and you're there every Sunday,

654
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 "and throughout the week trying to be a part of the body?"

655
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And she just said, "No, it's busy.

656
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 "Life's busy, and I really hadn't found one that I like,

657
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 "and we've been looking.

658
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 "We interviewed churches for a couple weeks,

659
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 "and we just didn't see one, so I just don't know.

660
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 "But no, we're not really going to one right now."

661
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Cool.

662
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 I'm sure marriage and children

663
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 are going to make that a lot easier.

664
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Come with me sometime when I'm trying to check in

665
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 my three kids into child care on Sunday morning.

666
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I don't think I've ever made it in here

667
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 before 30 minutes after the service started.

668
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 I mean, it's like those things don't make it easier, friend.

669
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And by the way, what makes you think

670
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 you're going to do different than--

671
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Some of you are here, and you're like,

672
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 "Yeah, I do think, man, I'll be great.

673
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 "I'll go to church, and I'll belong there."

674
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 And you're not going to church now.

675
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 And I'm just saying, "No, you won't.

676
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 "Let me just shoot you real straight.

677
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 "No, you won't.

678
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 "You're going to do more of later

679
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 "what you already do today.

680
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 "That's what you're going to do.

681
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 "That's what people do.

682
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 "Life's a pattern.

683
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 "You get stuck in a pattern.

684
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 "That's what's going to happen."

685
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 You could change it right now.

686
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 You could plead with God's Holy Spirit

687
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 to change it in you, to help you,

688
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 and to move towards those things.

689
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 You're becoming something.

690
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 You're becoming something.

691
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 And so if you can't be pure outside of marriage,

692
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 what would make you think that you can be pure in marriage?

693
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 If you can't be pure--

694
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 And when I say pure, I mean like in and out of a relationship,

695
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 like personally pure as well.

696
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Like some of you are thinking,

697
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 "Man, yeah, I struggle with porn,

698
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 "I struggle with masturbation,

699
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 "but that'll change when I'm married."

700
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 It'll change, it'll grow.

701
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 It'll become a bigger problem in marriage.

702
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 That's what will happen.

703
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Yeah.

704
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 You're looking at someone and saying,

705
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 "I'm unfaithful.

706
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 "Marry me.

707
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 "I don't know how to be faithful."

708
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 So don't marry someone who has proven to be an adulterer.

709
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And I'm not talking about someone who's made a bad choice

710
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 or someone who has a past.

711
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Those people can change.

712
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Listen, I was that person.

713
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 I was a porn addict, sex addict.

714
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 I surrendered my life to God through Jesus Christ,

715
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 and he began to change me,

716
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 and I got committed and serious about that

717
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 by his grace at work and my life.

718
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 And so I'm not saying someone who has a past.

719
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 I'm saying someone who has a present, you know?

720
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 They're still in it.

721
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Paul just says if you marry, you don't do what is wrong.

722
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 If you remain single, you don't do what is wrong.

723
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 The only wrong is to obsess over what is not available to you

724
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 or to pretend that you are in a life stage that you're not.

725
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 And so my challenge for you is to use this season to be single-minded,

726
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 meaning singularly focused on God and what he desires

727
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 but also living in the season that he has you,

728
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 which is singleness.

729
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 And so Paul writes this idea, and let's just be honest.

730
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 It's in 1 Corinthians 7.

731
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 There's some strange things going on in the church of Corinth.

732
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 Isn't Paul the only one who says this?

733
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 And any kind of weird here, like, man, he's just bitter, single man.

734
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 That's what's going on here.

735
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Paul's just angry, and so he doesn't want anybody else to be married

736
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 because he's not married.

737
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 He couldn't find a wife, and so he doesn't want me to have a wife.

738
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Is that what's going on here?

739
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Did you know Jesus says the same thing?

740
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Paul's just expounding on Jesus' idea.

741
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 It comes from Matthew 19.

742
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Let me read it to you.

743
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 "I tell you that"--okay, so they've asked him,

744
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 "Jesus, is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"

745
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 He says, "You know what?

746
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 "The Lord has brought together, 'Let man not separate.'"

747
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 In one word, "No," he says.

748
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 And then he says this, "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife

749
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 "except for sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery."

750
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 And so the disciples, they hear this, and they're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

751
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 "You're talking about, like, marriage.

752
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 "Like, it's forever or something.

753
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 "And if that's the situation between a husband and a wife,

754
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 "it's better not to marry," to which Jesus doesn't say--

755
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 "No, no, no, hold on, guys.

756
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 "No, no, no, hold on.

757
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 "No, no, you misunderstood me.

758
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 "It's not that it's not better.

759
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 "Okay, let me explain this.

760
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 "No, marriage is really good.

761
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 "That's not what he says.

762
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 "Let me just show you what he says, okay?"

763
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 They say, "It must be better not to marry," to which Jesus says,

764
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 "Not everyone can accept this word,

765
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 "but only to those to whom it has been given.

766
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 "For there are eunuchs," which is a unique word.

767
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 A eunuch is a person without reproductive parts.

768
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Okay, you tracking with me?

769
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 All right.

770
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 "There are eunuchs who were born that way,

771
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 "and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others,

772
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 "which I say we should pray for those guys.

773
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 "And there are those who choose to live like eunuchs."

774
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 Now, listen to this part, okay?

775
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 So eunuchs are those without reproductive organs.

776
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 "There are those who choose to live like those

777
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 "without sexual desire for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.

778
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 "And the one who can accept this should accept this."

779
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 What?

780
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 Jesus says several profound things.

781
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Let me go over them.

782
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 He says, one, marriage is forever.

783
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 And so if it's forever, it takes a lot of preparation.

784
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 We should prepare for it.

785
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 Two, he says there's only two options.

786
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 You can choose celibacy or you can choose marriage.

787
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 Those are your only two God-honoring options.

788
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 You have celibacy, and then you have the outlet for sex,

789
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 which is marriage.

790
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 There's no other outlet for sexual release, okay?

791
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Celibacy or marriage, those are your two options

792
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 according to the one who gave you life

793
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 and made the world and everything in it.

794
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 And then he says, "There are some who are single

795
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 "for the sake of the kingdom."

796
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 And so they're not selfishly single,

797
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 not like, "Oh, man, single's fun.

798
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
 "I'm gonna play the field.

799
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 "I'm gonna jack with hearts.

800
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 "I'm gonna have friends with benefits."

801
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 No, they're single for only one reason,

802
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 single for the sake of the kingdom.

803
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And so he's saying, he's expounding on this idea

804
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 that singleness is a gift to which a friend asked me,

805
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 "Well, is it a gift like cancer?"

806
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 To which I say, "No."

807
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Okay, it's not.

808
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Like, cancer is bad.

809
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Cancer's always bad.

810
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Singleness, the scripture says, is good.

811
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 It's not like a rejoice in suffering kind of gift.

812
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 It's a gift that you actually use

813
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 and honor God with.

814
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 And so Jesus says, "Some should remain single

815
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 "for the sake of the kingdom."

816
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Who is that?

817
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 It's those that can't or don't marry.

818
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 And he says, "Some will, and they should do so forever."

819
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Expounding, Paul is just expounding

820
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 on the idea of Jesus Christ as Savior.

821
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 So in summary, to see your status

822
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 or your singleness as a gift,

823
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 trust the one who's entrusted it to you.

824
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 The reason you're single is to be devoted to the Lord.

825
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 And thirdly, a season of singleness

826
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 might be preparing you for a life of marriage.

827
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Therefore, prepare well.

828
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 Use this season to prepare well.

829
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 It's interesting, the nutcracker,

830
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 it ended up kind of being the highlight of Christmas.

831
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 I mean, of course, there was the baby in the manger,

832
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 and that was really the highlight of Christmas.

833
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 But they had a lot of fun, let me just say,

834
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 with this nutcracker.

835
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 We would drive by the Elmore's house,

836
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 and it was on their front porch,

837
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and it was lit up and everything.

838
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And so people would come and knock on their door.

839
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 In fact, this one gentleman comes and goes,

840
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 "Hey, man, I know the people that live here

841
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 "must have a sense of humor.

842
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 "I mean, you got a nutcracker with a beer belly out there."

843
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 And my friend John got to engage with him

844
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 and share the gospel with him.

845
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 And this thing that was considered this curse

846
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 ended up being such a tremendous blessing in the season

847
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 that we would continue to talk.

848
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 We talk about it today still.

849
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 In fact, it reminded, I mean, that's how I thought about it

850
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 is we were just dialoguing about how funny

851
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 that whole exchange was and how fun it ended up being,

852
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 that it actually gave them life.

853
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 It was actually something that they didn't need to lose,

854
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 but they could actually use.

855
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 And I never want to play games with you guys,

856
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 and so I just want to have a real transparent moment

857
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 with you as we end.

858
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 It was a really hard week.

859
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 The past two weeks, really difficult, challenging weeks.

860
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 And what that looked like is we're moving,

861
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 we're building a home,

862
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 but we have to move from our house into a temporary house

863
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 so that we can eventually move into that house.

864
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 So we're moving, knowing that we're going to have to move again.

865
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 I'm just like, "Oh."

866
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 And so then we had a garage sale.

867
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 And so garage sales are hard because you take all of this stuff

868
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 that you invested money in, you put it on your lawn,

869
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 and you exchange it for a nickel.

870
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 And so people are coming over and taking all of my stuff,

871
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 and I don't like that, and they're giving me pennies for it.

872
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 And so in the midst of the garage sale,

873
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 there was just a lot of challenging things that happened.

874
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 And then Monica begins to complain about her leg,

875
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 saying that her leg hurts, to which I look at it,

876
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 and right here on the back of her leg is this red mark.

877
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 And so she gets on an antibiotic in the midst of that,

878
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 but the red mark, it just kind of starts growing and growing.

879
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 And I'm thinking, "Hey, the antibiotic's got to be working."

880
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 And she's telling me, "Hey, babe, my leg really hurts."

881
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 And I'm kind of like, "Hey, suck it up,"

882
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 which I know makes me husband of the year.

883
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 But I'm like, "Hey, it's going to be okay."

884
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 And we got a lot going on.

885
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 And she even says, "Man, I think the first time we had a garage sale,

886
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 it was a lot easier."

887
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 And I'm like, "Yeah, absolutely, because I don't know if you noticed,

888
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 but Weston's trying to ride the skateboard in the street,

889
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 and he's 20 months old, and the girls are chasing the neighbor's dog over there.

890
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 Come back, Presley!"

891
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 Okay, now, "Okay, what is that, sir?

892
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 You'd like to give me a nickel for that plasma? Okay, here you go."

893
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 And so all of these things are going on, and I'm like,

894
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 "Yes, it was easier when we were--life was simpler, and life's not so simple now."

895
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 And she's like, "By the way, my leg hurts."

896
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 I'm like, "It's going to be okay. You're taking an antibiotic."

897
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 [laughter]

898
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 And so about 10 p.m., she's like, "I'm just going to text my dermatologist."

899
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 I'm like, "Fine."

900
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 [laughter]

901
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 She texts a picture of her leg.

902
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 Dermatologist calls immediately back and says,

903
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 "Hey, you need to go to the ER right now."

904
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 So I'm like, "How can we go to the ER? We've got these three kids in the other room."

905
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 So I'm like, "Hey, can somebody come over and watch the kids

906
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 while we go to the ER so they can tell us that nothing's wrong?"

907
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 And so then my--I know, wicked person.

908
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 So somebody comes over and watches the kids, and we leave,

909
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 and we go to the emergency room to which they say--they rush us to the back and say,

910
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 "I was so glad that you came in. Her body's fighting this infection.

911
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 That's what's happening. We need to lance this--

912
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 we need to cut into her leg right now."

913
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
 And I was like, "Really? Hey, babe, I'm sorry."

914
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 [laughter]

915
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 And I just went real nice, kind of through all of that.

916
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
 Like it just felt like the weight of the world, and like I was teaching here,

917
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
 and then I'm teaching in Houston on Thursday,

918
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
 and all of it--I taught this morning at this thing,

919
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 and just like the distraction of ministry, and I forsake.

920
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
 I took for granted my ministry.

921
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
 I missed out on my primary ministry.

922
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
 I let you guys down. I let my family down.

923
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
 I let my community down.

924
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 I couldn't stand before you and say, "Follow me as I follow Christ,"

925
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 in the way that I strive to live with my wife in an understanding way,

926
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 1 Peter 3, 7, or Ephesians 5, 25,

927
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 that I would love her as Christ loved the church and gave his life for his bride.

928
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
 I missed my primary ministry.

929
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
 And can I tell you something else?

930
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
 When I was single, I missed my primary ministry.

931
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Man, I would love to be up here and be like, "Hey, do it just like I did.

932
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
 Don't do it like I did."

933
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 Probably my greatest regret in the world

934
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
 is that I missed out on ministry when I was single.

935
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
 Man, I look back on those days like, "Man, what if--we could have done that.

936
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Man, we could have changed that nation.

937
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 We could have made that whole nation have water or food to eat.

938
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
 We could have done that."

939
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
 Man, I could have--that neighbor that I had who was lost,

940
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 he could be in heaven if the Lord would have used me in that way,

941
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 but he didn't because I wasn't available to be used.

942
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
 Man, I could have studied the Word.

943
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
 I could have known the Scriptures like people who really know the Bible.

944
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
 I could have taught and drawn from my 20s, but I didn't read the Bible.

945
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
 All while I called myself a Christian, I was playing games.

946
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 I wasn't a Christian. I was a Dallasite.

947
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
 I look like Dallas and smell like Dallas and talk like Dallas,

948
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
 and I did the things that Dallas said.

949
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
 All while I called myself a Christian, and I wasn't a Christian.

950
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 If I would have died, I wouldn't have been with God

951
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 because I didn't fully understand what he did to set me free from Dallas,

952
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 free from my sins.

953
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 I didn't understand what he did so that I could use my singleness for his glory.

954
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
 I want you to plug into a church and belong there.

955
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
 I beg you to. This is your week.

956
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
 Get in a community, a group of friends that you're doing life with.

957
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
 Sit across from them and say, "Hey, guys, is there weird quirkiness in me

958
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
 that you think God wants to change? Is there a reason that I'm single

959
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 and I don't want to be?" If you don't want to be, maybe you want to be.

960
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
 But let them be honest with you. Say, "Hey, guys, what if?"

961
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
 Ask that a lot when you're single. Ask, "What if?" a lot.

962
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
 "Man, what if we moved there? What if we moved to West Dallas

963
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
 and began to just love on people down there?

964
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 Do you think we could change a community?"

965
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 Oh, yeah, you can. Oh, yeah, gifted folks in this room, you absolutely can.

966
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
 These are the things I want you to do. All right?

967
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
 Listen, here's what I promise you. God's Word promises you.

968
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
 You won't regret it. Keep having sex, you'll regret it.

969
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 Living with your significant other, you'll regret it.

970
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
 If you're a follower of Christ, you will regret it.

971
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 Keep looking at porn, you'll regret it.

972
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
 Keep wasting your singleness, you'll regret it.

973
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 But you say, "Hey, God, here's my life. Would you use me?"

974
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
 I'm not focusing on the don'ts. This isn't a don't message.

975
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
 This is, "Hey, go and be used," message.

976
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
 Surrender to God, message.

977
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 Look to Him and say, "Lord, how do you want to use me?" message.

978
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 Don't try to lose the gift. Use the gift.

979
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
 Let me pray.

980
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 Father, would you help us do that?

981
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
 Would you make us believe that, God?

982
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 Would you stir in our hearts that reality, Lord?

983
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 Would you show my friends, would you convict the ones you need to convict, Father,

984
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
 that your Spirit would sit heavy on their hearts,

985
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 showing them the things that they've done that have been a dishonor to you,

986
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
 and Lord, remind them of the things that you've done

987
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 so that they don't have to pay for those things,

988
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 that you've paid for those things through Jesus,

989
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
 that they don't have to leave guilty, Father, that they can leave new, Father.

990
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
 And for other ones who have been wasting their singleness, God,

991
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 I pray that you would stir in their hearts and minds

992
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
 the things that they can do to live in a way that's brave,

993
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
 to live in a way to be used by you.

994
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
 As your eyes go to and fro, looking for hearts that are fully yours, God,

995
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
 that you would see us and use us and find us available to you to be used, God.

996
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
 For we love you and we love the way you work and move.

997
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
 It is in Jesus' name. Amen.

998
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
 [Silence]
