1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,900
 - Let's go 2019.

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,360
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,280
 Come on man.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,560
 Yeah, 2019 looks good on y'all, okay.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,520
 Hey, we're starting a new series tonight called Self Care.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,460
 We could not be more excited about this series

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,760
 as we dive into a very popular term

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,020
 and culture right now of self care.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,400
 My most recent experience with the new form of self care

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,200
 is related to something called the chiropractor.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,240
 I don't know, anybody chiropractic people out there?

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,800
 Anyone over the age of 30 something?

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,260
 I had some like back pain recently

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,240
 and a friend was like, oh dude,

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,760
 you gotta go check out the chiropractor.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,640
 So went to the chiropractor with kind of fear

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,000
 and trepidation of like what sort of witch of indoor

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,160
 witch doctor am I about to walk into right now?

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,800
 Because the spine feels like a pretty valuable

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,060
 component of the body.

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,320
 If you're gonna lose a finger, that's one thing.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,800
 If you're gonna be forfeiting something with the spine,

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,440
 that feels like a bigger deal.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,920
 So I kind of go in there and basically was like,

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,540
 hey, can we not touch the neck?

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,600
 I've heard that can kill ya.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,280
 And so they went through it and I went a couple times

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,360
 and dude, and it worked.

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,800
 I was like, I stand before you a healed man.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,640
 I tell you that.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,480
 [congregation laughing]

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,760
 And so that was kind of the most recent self-care.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,120
 But dude, I love self-care.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,800
 I'm a fan and I'm not just a fan.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,420
 Like I'm a fad self-care person.

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,200
 Like I kind of go from one fad to the next along with it

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,360
 of like, oh man, yeah, this is gonna work this time.

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,000
 Whether it's like, you guys remember P90X?

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
 Anybody do P90X?

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,400
 [congregation laughing]

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
 That guy was so creepy.

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,760
 To Insanity and Shanti or CrossFit, any CrossFit people?

44
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,640
 [congregation cheering]

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
 You guys are all eating kale and doing deadlifts together.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,200
 Or just intermittent fasting is like a new thing.

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
 I feel like I'm always down to try something new

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
 that kind of comes along.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,360
 Advocare, anybody remember or do Advocare?

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,680
 Yeah, I tried it.

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,060
 I can never remember to take the vitamins.

52
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,200
 I just like would buy them and then throw,

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
 it was basically like putting money down the toilet.

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,920
 But here's the truth.

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,600
 I'm not the only person who loves self-care.

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,560
 Like our world is filled, we love self-care.

57
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,600
 And there's no time of the year that we as a society

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,480
 are more into self-care than really

59
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
 the beginning of the year.

60
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,600
 Where New Year's resolutions are rolling out

61
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
 and people are going back to the gym

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,640
 and you got all these kinds of different goals for 2019.

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
 So I don't know what self-care looks like for you,

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,600
 but our society is really all about it.

65
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,240
 Even that term of, hey, self-care,

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,880
 whether it's staycations or hey,

67
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,160
 it's an excuse to go to the spa or join a yoga class

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,880
 or fast pass, any fast pass people in here

69
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,800
 or bar classes or class pass, not fast pass,

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,520
 that's Disney World, class pass.

71
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,760
 (congregation laughing)

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,900
 Or getting your nails done or just taking a vacation

73
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,480
 or retail therapy.

74
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,280
 Any retail therapists in here under the banner

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,100
 of treat yourself?

76
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
 Here's my favorite thing about self-care though.

77
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
 If you've heard the expression,

78
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,060
 which is just something in culture,

79
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,020
 it's like it's a virtuous way to do all the things

80
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,420
 you wanna do anyways.

81
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,380
 You thought about this?

82
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,600
 It's like, yeah, I'm sorry, I have to break my commitment

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,840
 and stay home and put cucumbers on my eyes

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,160
 because if I don't care of me, take care of me,

85
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,000
 I can't take care of you.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,800
 So this, you're welcome, really, is what this is all about.

87
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,980
 I feel like I need this massage right now

88
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,440
 because if I don't get it, I'm cranky.

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,640
 If I don't sleep at least this amount,

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,320
 then I'm just not me.

91
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,620
 And so it's like a new virtuous way

92
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,500
 to kinda do the things that we wanna do anyways.

93
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,940
 But biblically speaking, that would be a little bit more

94
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,660
 like selfish care, if you will.

95
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,860
 But there are things that the Bible says

96
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,220
 we as followers of Jesus should have in our life

97
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,280
 to experience self-care.

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
 Said another way, there is biblical self-care

99
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,140
 that the Bible lays out.

100
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,720
 And so for the next handful of weeks,

101
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,100
 we're gonna look at some of the teachings

102
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,780
 as it relates to scripture about how you can be

103
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,560
 a healthier you and experience a better self-care

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,640
 as it relates to your mind, body, soul, spirit,

105
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,860
 kinda rest in general.

106
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,120
 So we're gonna kick this off and hopefully,

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
 I think it's gonna be really, really helpful

108
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,560
 and we are excited.

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,900
 But tonight, we are gonna dive into the starting point

110
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,080
 of self-care, that if you don't get this thing

111
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,180
 that we're gonna discuss tonight right,

112
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,080
 then any amount of yoga that you add to your regimen

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,680
 is just gonna be useless, or ultimately not gonna be

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,140
 meeting the greatest needs that you have.

115
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,720
 So tonight, we're gonna dive into the starting point

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
 of self-care.

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,380
 If you take notes, you can write out

118
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,220
 the starting point of self-care.

119
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,840
 We're gonna be in John chapter four

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,460
 and we're gonna look at an interaction that Jesus has

121
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,840
 with a lady and in it, he lays out three things

122
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
 that are crucial to your understanding,

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
 my understanding of self-care,

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,020
 if you're gonna experience it at any point in your life

125
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,140
 and in 2019 this year.

126
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,880
 So in John chapter four, if you go to Bible,

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,900
 you can flip open there, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

128
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,120
 John was written by the apostle John,

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,300
 one of Jesus's best friends.

130
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,640
 And he lays out and writes this account

131
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,560
 of an interaction Jesus has with this woman

132
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
 and we're gonna pick it up in verse four.

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,280
 You may have heard this story before,

134
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,100
 but some of the more profound truths

135
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,780
 that are contained really in the entire New Testament

136
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,160
 are recorded in this interaction that Jesus has.

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,260
 We learned something about him, something about you,

138
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,560
 and something about self-care.

139
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,640
 So we're gonna, three takeaways.

140
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,040
 We'll start in verse four and go from there.

141
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,980
 Now he, that's speaking of Jesus,

142
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,240
 had to go through Samaria.

143
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
 Now let me pause.

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,440
 Here's why this is significant, why John is including it.

145
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,640
 So John is basically saying, hey, Jesus, starting out,

146
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,000
 he had to go through Samaria.

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
 What was Samaria?

148
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,080
 Samaria was this area, I think we have a map that's up here,

149
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,180
 that no one, if you were a Jewish person,

150
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,600
 you never went through Samaria.

151
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
 There was a phrase in that time that, hey,

152
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,100
 you would dust the sand off of your sandals

153
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,000
 if you got any of Samaria on you

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,220
 because it was an area that was filled

155
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,080
 with kind of former Jewish people

156
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,200
 that basically married a bunch of pagans

157
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,280
 and kind of blended all these different religions together.

158
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,760
 So if you're in the Jewish areas,

159
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
 put it back up there, Billy,

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,320
 in the green on the top and the bottom,

161
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,480
 in order to get to any of these areas,

162
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
 you would go all the way,

163
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,680
 you wouldn't travel directly through,

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,060
 you'd go all the way around by the Jordan River

165
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,200
 because you wanted to avoid Samaria.

166
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,120
 It was kind of a rough neighborhood, if you will.

167
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,800
 Child sacrifice was a part of kind of cult worship there.

168
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,900
 And so this was not a people that got along well

169
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,840
 with Jewish people, Samaritans and Jewish people.

170
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,540
 And yet Jesus does what no one did in that day.

171
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,440
 And he says, I have to go through this area,

172
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,920
 and we're gonna discover why here in a second.

173
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,340
 So when he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar,

174
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,280
 near the plot of the ground

175
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,360
 that Jacob had given his son Joseph,

176
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,600
 Jacob's well was there.

177
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,200
 And Jesus, tired as he was from his journey,

178
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,560
 he sat down by the well, and it was noon.

179
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,000
 So Jesus walking along, stops at this town,

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,840
 there's a well, he sits down by the well, and it's noon.

181
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,860
 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water,

182
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,440
 Jesus said to her, will you give me a drink?

183
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,560
 Because his disciples had gone into food to buy town.

184
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,920
 The Samaritan woman said to him,

185
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,960
 you are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman.

186
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,080
 How can you ask me for a drink?

187
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,800
 For Jews, John writes in parenthesis,

188
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,840
 do not associate with Samaritans.

189
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,000
 And Jesus answered, and he says what only Jesus

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,700
 could get away with saying, if you knew the gift of God,

191
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,780
 and who it is that's asking you for a drink,

192
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,000
 you would have asked him,

193
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,240
 and he would have given you living water.

194
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,480
 I say this because, ladies, if a guy ever interacts with you

195
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,840
 as it relates to a question and says,

196
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,220
 if you knew the gift of God,

197
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,880
 standing in front, like only Jesus can say this type of thing

198
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,180
 because he's Jesus, he is the gift of God.

199
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,040
 And for God so loved the world, he gave.

200
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,360
 And so Jesus says, if you knew who was talking to you,

201
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
 you would have asked me for water.

202
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,440
 But she said, sir, you have nothing to draw with,

203
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,240
 and the well is deep.

204
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,920
 Where can you get this living water?

205
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,280
 Are you greater than our father Jacob,

206
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
 who gave us this well and drank from it himself,

207
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,100
 as did his sons and livestock?

208
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,480
 And Jesus answered and said,

209
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,720
 everyone who drinks from the well,

210
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,280
 from this water, from this well, will be thirsty again.

211
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,760
 I'm gonna hit pause really quick

212
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,840
 because it'll give us really a launching point

213
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,000
 into the first idea as it relates to self-care.

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
 Jesus points out something that all of us,

215
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,360
 it's not that crazy profound that he just says,

216
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,000
 hey, if you drink this water, you're gonna thirst again.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
 That this will not be something

218
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,320
 that'll finally satisfy you

219
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,680
 or satisfy you for more than even a day.

220
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,020
 It'll be something that you'll have to continue

221
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,360
 to come back to over and over again.

222
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,400
 But he's trying to launch into a conversation

223
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,520
 with this lady, and he's gonna use the physical idea

224
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,440
 of water to begin to say, hey, there's thirst that you have

225
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 that you are unable to meet by yourself.

226
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,880
 The first idea I wanna pull out from this text

227
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 is that self-care without Christ, or alone,

228
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
 self-care is not enough.

229
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,560
 It will not last, it won't last.

230
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
 Self-care without Christ will not last.

231
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,200
 Like Jesus points to herself,

232
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,320
 hey, if you keep drinking this water,

233
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,560
 it's really simple, you're gonna have to come back

234
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,840
 here tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day.

235
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,600
 And he's doing so because he wants to begin

236
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,240
 to talk about thirsts and something lacking

237
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,800
 in this lady's life, 'cause Jesus knew

238
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,760
 who he was talking to.

239
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,880
 This wasn't just any woman.

240
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,520
 This is a woman who didn't just have physical thirst.

241
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,520
 She had voids in her life that she was trying to meet

242
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,560
 and was coming up empty over and over and over again.

243
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,880
 What do I mean by that?

244
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,440
 A few verses later, we're told,

245
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,960
 as they continue the conversation,

246
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,580
 this was a woman who had been married five times.

247
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,440
 And she was sleeping with a man who is not her husband.

248
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,280
 Today, just a few verses later,

249
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
 Jesus, in the conversation, says,

250
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
 hey, go call your husband.

251
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
 She says, I don't have a husband.

252
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,920
 And Jesus says, you're right.

253
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,880
 When you say you have no husband,

254
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,800
 the fact is you have had five husbands.

255
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,440
 And the man you're sleeping with now,

256
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,040
 or you have now, is not your husband.

257
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,280
 What you've said is true.

258
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,040
 Five husbands today is pretty rare.

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
 If you meet someone that's on their fifth husband,

260
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,800
 or on their sixth suitor, their sixth man,

261
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,040
 it's like, that's pretty unusual.

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,760
 In this day, it was unheard of.

263
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,360
 This was a woman that had gone from one relationship

264
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,080
 to the next to the next and come up empty

265
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
 over and over and over again.

266
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
 And Jesus is trying to launch into a conversation saying,

267
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,840
 hey, if you try to self-care or care for yourself

268
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,880
 or cope with the emptiness in yourself alone,

269
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,780
 you will always come up empty over and over and over again.

270
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,940
 That this was a girl, I mean,

271
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,580
 this is the most clear expression of a girl

272
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,140
 who is thirsty in all the New Testament.

273
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,060
 You know what I mean by that?

274
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,500
 For anyone who's not used to that term,

275
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,260
 which I feel like is my favorite recent term,

276
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,180
 not long ago, or a little while ago,

277
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,020
 I was hanging with a friend, my friend Jake,

278
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,300
 and he was like, we were talking about some relationship,

279
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,740
 you're dating, and he brought, he was like,

280
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,300
 dude, that girl is just thirsty.

281
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,340
 I'm like, like she needs a beverage?

282
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,540
 What do you mean thirsty?

283
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,660
 He's like, no, she's like looking for a relationship.

284
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,820
 But even today, we use this kind of term,

285
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,740
 and this is a woman who, if anyone in the New Testament

286
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,220
 is relationally thirsty, it would be her.

287
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,700
 And she had gone from one to the next to the next,

288
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,220
 trying to fill this void and come up empty.

289
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,500
 But if you try to self-care on your own,

290
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,540
 whether it's through a new workout regimen,

291
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,340
 whether it's through new goals that you have for this year,

292
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,180
 whether it's through health,

293
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,820
 whether it's through a number of spa days,

294
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,160
 you will always come up empty.

295
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,300
 If you try to just self-cope

296
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,460
 and self-medicate with the world and experience like,

297
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,740
 hey man, I need a drink tonight,

298
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,820
 or I need this new purse, or I need this,

299
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,620
 fill in the blank, or I need a relationship,

300
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,580
 you will always come up empty.

301
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,980
 And Jesus is saying that if you self-care without Christ,

302
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,700
 you will always find something that does not last.

303
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,440
 Because the truth is, just like she was thirsty,

304
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,980
 there was a void on the inside.

305
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,180
 There is a void on inside of all of us.

306
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,000
 That you are thirsty and I am thirsty.

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,520
 And if we are not aware of the ways

308
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,540
 that we will, out of that just void,

309
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,760
 or out of unmet desires, try to meet those things,

310
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,520
 you are putting yourself in incredible danger.

311
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,640
 Like, candidly, I have thirst,

312
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,600
 I can have thirsts inside of me,

313
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
 or desires inside of me that are just destructive

314
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,200
 for me, for people around me, for my family.

315
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,740
 Like a desire for, hey, I just need the approval of people,

316
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,740
 and I just wanna be liked, that if I let rule my life,

317
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,500
 will lead me to a place where I no longer

318
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,220
 am concerned about the things that God cares about,

319
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,980
 I'm concerned about what you care about.

320
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,900
 A desire is inside of my life that could lead me

321
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,300
 to commit adultery because I wanna have sex

322
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,860
 with women who are not my wife.

323
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,820
 Desire is inside of me for just money and materialism,

324
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,260
 and man, I just need to go make a bunch of money.

325
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,620
 And if I'm not careful, out of that thirst,

326
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,840
 I will let that thirst lead me to take actions

327
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,640
 that will impact not just me, but all those around me.

328
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,300
 Where are you thirsty?

329
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,020
 Maybe it's just an insatiable, like you're constantly

330
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,160
 consumed with what people think about you,

331
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,120
 or your social media, or maybe it's a need for control,

332
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,160
 and you have an eating disorder right now.

333
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,840
 Or just a loneliness that's inside of you

334
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,480
 that constantly comes up, and it's leading you

335
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,400
 to make decisions like, I mean, pornography,

336
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,060
 you know what pornography, the number one reason

337
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,380
 people who study it would say people get addicted to porn

338
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,220
 or people watch pornography, they want to feel desired.

339
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,540
 Thirsty.

340
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,220
 And the problem is not necessarily that you're thirsty,

341
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,940
 that's gonna be a reality, it is what you do

342
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,780
 with that thirst.

343
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,020
 And you need to have a death grip on the fact

344
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,300
 that there are desires and things in you

345
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,860
 that want to run your life into the ground,

346
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,820
 that wanna lead you to make decisions,

347
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,760
 that will lead you into every place from a rehab

348
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
 to broken relationship after the next.

349
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,300
 Do you know what those are?

350
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
 I have a dog named Judah who is a Rhodesian Ridgeback,

351
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,760
 he's like, yeah, he's like a little baby elephant.

352
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,440
 He's 130 pounds, he's enormous.

353
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,560
 And yeah, yeah, sweet.

354
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,720
 And he did the weirdest thing.

355
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,320
 This dog will eat out of the trash can while we're gone.

356
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,300
 And that may be like, oh, you know, that's kind of sweet,

357
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,340
 maybe you have an open trash can.

358
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
 We have a trash can in a drawer.

359
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,700
 He can pull the drawer open because he's like six four

360
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,500
 and he can get his face in there

361
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,120
 and eat out of the trash can.

362
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,300
 What happens when a dog eats out of the trash?

363
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,660
 He's like, I'm hungry, that looks good,

364
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,140
 and he begins to eat water bottles.

365
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,180
 What happens, you might think,

366
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,540
 whenever your dog eats water bottles?

367
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,860
 Well, it causes some complications.

368
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,140
 And so he is constantly making decisions

369
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,980
 and out of his hunger, eating from the trash,

370
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,100
 which leads to all kinds of exciting opportunities

371
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,720
 to be a good neighbor and pick up your dog's liquid

372
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,620
 that's rushing out of him at times.

373
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
 And you may be like, oh man, that's kind of weird,

374
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,000
 why are you telling me this thing?

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,820
 Here's what will happen because of this decision.

376
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,560
 My dog is what you would call a walking pooper.

377
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,760
 And of course, the appropriate term.

378
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,120
 So because he'll eat trash, then we'll take him to the park,

379
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,320
 we'll go outside and there's people all around us.

380
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,080
 Any dog owners here, you will have sympathy

381
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,040
 for what I'm talking about.

382
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,480
 So you go around, you got your dog,

383
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,880
 you're hanging out at the parks with all these kids.

384
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,660
 Hey, have a great day, sun's outside.

385
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,100
 And then the dog will be like, oh man,

386
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,900
 the water bottle is needing to come out,

387
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,220
 but it can't come out, so he will just begin squatting

388
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,980
 and walking around and circling people.

389
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,600
 How do you stop a dog from doing that

390
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
 when you're around people and you're like,

391
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,020
 he's got a water bottle in there and it's,

392
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,860
 there's nothing coming out.

393
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,500
 I would get it if it was.

394
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,780
 And literally, he was like going around

395
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,900
 a two-year-old the other day and I'm like,

396
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,220
 Judah, stop, Judah, stop it right now.

397
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,780
 I mean, you can't stop.

398
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,700
 He's like, dude, when you gotta go, you gotta go.

399
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 And it is causing complications,

400
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,160
 not just in his life, but in all those around him.

401
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,700
 (congregation laughing)

402
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,120
 In the same way.

403
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,380
 (laughing)

404
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,900
 There is something, as crazy as it sounds,

405
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,940
 in me that wants to eat from the trash.

406
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,700
 And it's not the trash of a trash can,

407
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,000
 it is the trash of pornography.

408
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 It is the trash of finding my worth in other people.

409
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,140
 It is the trash of vanity and body image

410
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,660
 or trash of, hey, if I only made more money.

411
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,760
 The trash of, man, I wanna be seen as impressive to people.

412
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,060
 And it is the trash that if you feed yourself that,

413
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,020
 it's gonna have side effects.

414
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,720
 I don't know what trash you are tempted to eat,

415
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,520
 but you need to have a death grip and awareness on that.

416
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,840
 Because it's not just that self-care

417
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
 without Christ won't last,

418
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,540
 it is that self-care without Christ can cost you.

419
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:49,420
 And this woman had followed that inner urge

420
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,360
 for relational, just connection with one man after the next,

421
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,540
 after the next, to the point where she's all alone,

422
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,560
 or she's living this life

423
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,280
 where she's not even married to this guy.

424
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,080
 I mean, that's why she came in the middle of the day.

425
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,320
 You don't come to a well

426
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,780
 in the middle of the day at this time.

427
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,800
 The reason she came is because she was an outcast.

428
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
 She was an outcast of the outcasts.

429
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,880
 Samaritans were outcasts.

430
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,060
 But even among men,

431
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,880
 you came in the morning to the well to get water,

432
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,920
 and at night when it was cool.

433
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
 You didn't go in the middle of the day

434
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,200
 unless you didn't wanna see anybody.

435
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,360
 And this was a woman who had made decision after decision

436
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,360
 out of her desire, and she'd found herself empty and alone.

437
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,320
 And Jesus says, you've gotta seek outside of yourself,

438
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,680
 and there is a solution.

439
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,840
 He continues in verse 16, 14, I'm sorry.

440
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,720
 But whoever drinks the water, Jesus speaking,

441
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,400
 that I give them will never thirst.

442
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,720
 Indeed, the water that I give them will become in them

443
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,460
 a spring of water welling up to eternal life.

444
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,040
 What are you saying, Jesus?

445
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,720
 Jesus is using this metaphor of water.

446
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,620
 Water is that thing that like the body, it has to have.

447
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,960
 Your body's like 50% water.

448
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,000
 If you don't have water, you will die.

449
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,760
 And unlike food, you can kinda last a little water

450
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,800
 but without water, you will die.

451
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,760
 It's necessary for life.

452
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,480
 And Jesus says in the same way that physical water

453
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,560
 is necessary to life, I offer a spiritual water

454
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,160
 that if you are gonna experience self-care,

455
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,020
 if you're gonna experience soul care,

456
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,440
 you're gonna have to have something from me.

457
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,240
 The second idea from this text is that self-care

458
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,040
 with Christ involves soul care.

459
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,280
 Jesus is trying to say I to whoever is interested,

460
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,000
 whoever is willing, whoever will receive it,

461
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,760
 I will offer them something that won't just quench

462
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,640
 their thirst and go into their stomach.

463
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,560
 I offer them something that will penetrate into their soul

464
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,100
 where nothing else can or like nothing else can.

465
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,240
 It would be such a tragedy if this year you met

466
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,840
 all of your goals as it relates to health and self-care

467
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,040
 and boundaries, and I hope you meet all of them.

468
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,360
 But you forfeited the thing that is your deepest need

469
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,480
 which is care at the soul.

470
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,680
 It would be such a tragedy if you came here tonight

471
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,160
 and you had a good time, you laughed,

472
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,620
 and the music was cool, but you didn't walk away

473
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,620
 experiencing relief at your greatest, deepest need

474
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,440
 which is at your soul, and Jesus says I alone

475
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,900
 am the one who can meet that need.

476
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,020
 And self-care without me is foolish, it will not last,

477
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,480
 but self-care with me will involve a soul care.

478
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,680
 That is what my desire for you to experience is.

479
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,080
 A relief almost.

480
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,680
 I wanna meet you at a place that nothing else in life

481
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
 can touch which is the soul.

482
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,480
 It's not hard to see like so many of the things

483
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
 that we think in life actually would satisfy.

484
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,920
 They never do.

485
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,800
 I mean like just if you think about it,

486
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,160
 like two clear ways that you can, all of us

487
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,480
 could probably see this is if you're in a relationship

488
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,280
 that you can, all of us could probably see this

489
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,720
 is one of them I would call the like

490
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,200
 I can't wait until mentality.

491
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,280
 I can't wait until mentality.

492
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,080
 People have this idea, I mean I remember having it

493
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,640
 where man I just can't wait till I'm dating.

494
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,400
 I'm dating someone, can't wait till we're engaged.

495
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,160
 We're engaged, can't wait till I'm married.

496
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,400
 Oh man, it's gonna be amazing.

497
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,520
 We get married, man I can't wait till we have kids.

498
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,320
 To have kids, I can't wait till we have kids

499
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,840
 that can dress themselves and sleep.

500
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
 I can't wait until they're in school.

501
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,300
 I can't wait till, it just goes from one thing to the next.

502
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,600
 And I don't know where, inside of the room

503
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
 I know most of us are either dating,

504
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,160
 maybe seriously dating, and if any of that mentality

505
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,480
 is like I can't wait, you are chasing a moving target

506
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,720
 that just moves along with you.

507
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,880
 Same thing happens with money.

508
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,560
 I mean remember in college when like I just can't wait

509
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,480
 to have a job, unbelievable 30 grand,

510
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,120
 I'm just like throwing money everywhere.

511
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
 And then you're like I can't wait till I have 40 grand,

512
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,920
 50 grand, and it never goes away.

513
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,440
 Because there's something inside of you

514
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,600
 that no amount of money, no relationship,

515
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,060
 nothing can touch but him, but Jesus.

516
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,600
 And he says self-care with me involves a soul care

517
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,220
 that I wanna come in and allow them to experience

518
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,220
 at the deepest level, satisfaction.

519
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,200
 The second place we see it is in just like celebrities.

520
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
 I mean you look at these people, I mean they're so,

521
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,540
 you're like you are the most attractive, wealthy,

522
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,140
 successful person ever and you work like you make a movie

523
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,140
 where someone just tells you to read a line

524
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,980
 for like a month, a year, you have everything

525
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,420
 anybody could ever want and the number of them

526
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,660
 that are on antidepressants is unbelievable.

527
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,220
 Just look into it.

528
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,780
 The number of them who've come out from Cameron Diaz

529
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,500
 to Tom Brady to Brad Pitt to Jim Carrey to Lady Gaga,

530
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,840
 Demi Lovato, on and on and said like hey,

531
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,740
 if you think anything he will satisfy, you are deceived.

532
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,660
 I mean just think even about the idea,

533
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,260
 they've got everything you ever want.

534
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,300
 They've got more access to self-care than we'll ever have.

535
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,260
 They get a massage a day, they get to have their own masseuse.

536
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,180
 They could go shopping whenever they want

537
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,480
 and not really get worried about it.

538
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,180
 Like they're able to go on vacation whenever they want to.

539
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,020
 They own a little small island and they're all depressed

540
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,680
 or many of them are.

541
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,460
 I mean think about that.

542
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,220
 You're going to Tahiti in your own little vacation

543
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,060
 and you're packing pills to help you cope

544
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,020
 with the depression of your life.

545
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,460
 That's crazy and I'm not saying anything

546
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
 about even antidepressant meds.

547
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,660
 That's not my point.

548
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,220
 My point is the people who have the life

549
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
 that everyone would go oh, that's amazing

550
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,220
 are trying to cope with just the sadness

551
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,960
 of the reality of their life 'cause there's something empty

552
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,340
 in them that no success, no fame, no money

553
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,220
 can ever satisfy and Jesus would say you're thirsty

554
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,980
 and there is only one well that can meet that need.

555
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,620
 There was an interview just with Tom Brady who does it again.

556
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,540
 I mean the dude's like 85 and he is just crushing it.

557
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,900
 It's unbelievable, Tom.

558
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
 Give everybody else a shot, okay?

559
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,260
 Sorry Patriots people and it's true

560
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,420
 and he interviewed on 60 Minutes and basically

561
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,220
 he said just this exact thing.

562
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,660
 He's the guy who's won multiple Super Bowls.

563
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,820
 He's married to this supermodel and here's what he said.

564
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,380
 Why do I have three Super Bowl rings

565
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,180
 and I think there's still something greater

566
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,920
 out there for me?

567
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,300
 I mean a lot of people would say hey man, this is it.

568
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,140
 I reached my goal, my dream, my life.

569
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,540
 Me, I think God, there's gotta be more than this.

570
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,480
 I mean this can't be all that it's cracked up to be.

571
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,860
 What's the answer, they asked him.

572
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,800
 He said I wish that I knew.

573
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,040
 I wish I knew.

574
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,300
 I think there's a lot of parts about me

575
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,140
 that I'm still trying to find.

576
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,100
 Translation, what did you just say, Tom Brader?

577
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,380
 The guy who's literally got, you'd be like

578
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,460
 that's gotta be nice.

579
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,040
 He says I climbed the mountain of success

580
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,140
 and I got to the top and there was nothing there.

581
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,980
 I've been on the wrong mountain.

582
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,020
 It's empty and Jesus would say

583
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,620
 there is no amount of success, no amount of money,

584
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,320
 no amount of relationship, there's no man out there,

585
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,540
 there's no woman out there, there's no ability

586
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,120
 to have children or whatever you find yourself being like.

587
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,120
 I wish, there's no job that can ultimately satisfy

588
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,500
 and there's no person who's in any circumstance out there

589
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,100
 that cannot currently experience satisfaction

590
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,000
 if it was turned to him.

591
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,060
 Jim Carrey said that I wish everyone could be rich

592
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,920
 and famous so they could see how empty

593
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,220
 and meaningless it all is.

594
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,820
 It's empty.

595
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:48,240
 So Jesus interacts with this woman

596
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,520
 and he basically presses in and says

597
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,340
 you've been married five times.

598
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,200
 One man to the next, you're thirsty

599
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,080
 and I offer you a water that can quench your thirst

600
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,040
 and he begins to kind of press in on an area

601
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,720
 that had to be a sensitive subject with this woman

602
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,800
 and what does she do?

603
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,880
 She does what many of us do.

604
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,680
 When God is kind of pressing in on us

605
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,220
 and we try to move away from it or change the subject,

606
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,060
 here's what happens.

607
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,460
 The woman said, sir, give me this water

608
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,540
 so I won't be thirsty, you have to come draw here

609
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,060
 and he told her, go and call your husband.

610
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,560
 You read this earlier.

611
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,820
 I have no husband, she said.

612
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,620
 Jesus said to her, you are right when you say

613
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,320
 you have no husband, the fact is you've had five

614
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,220
 and the man you have now is not your husband.

615
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,220
 What you've said is quite true.

616
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,200
 How long was the pause after that sentence?

617
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,940
 I mean, this is, I don't even know a modern equivalent.

618
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,720
 That a random stranger shows up and actually tells you

619
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,700
 something, there's like no way that he could know this

620
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,000
 and she begins to say, sir, I perceive that you are a prophet

621
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,900
 I can see that you're a prophet

622
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,580
 and then she does what so many of us do.

623
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,500
 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain

624
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,180
 but you Jews claim that the place

625
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,540
 where we must worship is in Jerusalem.

626
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,300
 Jesus brings up kind of this very tender topic with her

627
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
 and she's like, oh wow, okay, relational,

628
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,340
 you wanna talk about my relationships.

629
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,980
 While we're on the subject, you guys say we should worship

630
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,780
 on this mountain, let's talk about mountains

631
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,380
 and just tries to distract from the conversation

632
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,780
 and Jesus, you gotta love Jesus 'cause he goes with her

633
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,420
 and he says, woman, believe me, a time is coming

634
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,140
 when you will worship the Father

635
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,840
 neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

636
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,640
 You Samaritans worship what you do not know,

637
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,340
 we worship what we do know for salvation is from the Jews.

638
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,620
 Basically like God gave the Old Testament, the Bible then,

639
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,660
 to the Jewish people.

640
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,500
 Yet a time is coming and has now come

641
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,420
 when true worshipers will worship the Father

642
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,980
 in spirit and in truth

643
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,300
 for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.

644
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,140
 Jesus says, you're defining worship as you do worship

645
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,720
 at this mountain or that mountain or in this church

646
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,040
 or in this church building or at this time of the week

647
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,800
 or on Sunday, worship is not something you do at a building,

648
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,100
 it's not about where you worship

649
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,360
 or even when you worship, worship is something you do

650
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,540
 in spirit as in constantly.

651
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,940
 Worship is more about how you live your life.

652
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,040
 You're constantly living and constantly worshiping

653
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,660
 if you're worshiping or living in spirit and truth,

654
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,380
 Jesus says, for God is spirit and his worshipers

655
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,280
 must worship him in spirit and in truth.

656
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,060
 The woman said, I know that the Messiah,

657
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,320
 called the Christ, is coming and when he comes,

658
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,340
 he'll explain everything to us.

659
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,440
 Then Jesus declared, I, the one speaking to you, am he.

660
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,280
 We're gonna come back to that in a second,

661
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,080
 but Jesus essentially lays out, hey, worship,

662
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,100
 the most important thing about worship

663
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,580
 is not where you worship but who you worship

664
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,200
 and how you worship.

665
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,180
 Now, worship is something that's constantly going on

666
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,000
 and God is not seeking people to worship him

667
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,060
 in a building in a moment or not some religious exercise

668
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,420
 but a relationship.

669
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
 Self-care, if you're gonna experience it this year,

670
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,840
 and gosh, I want,

671
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,820
 if you're gonna experience self-care, health, growth,

672
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,060
 you to become everything that you wanna be in life,

673
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,300
 it is gonna involve the third idea,

674
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,340
 which self-care with Christ

675
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,760
 involves an ongoing relationship with him.

676
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,580
 It involves an ongoing relationship with Jesus,

677
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,300
 a growing relationship with him,

678
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,960
 not some religious action, that's what he's saying,

679
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,460
 hey, in spirit, constantly in connection with the Father.

680
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,020
 If you're gonna experience self-care,

681
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,800
 it involves an ongoing relationship,

682
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,060
 which means in order for you to have a growing relationship,

683
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,900
 what do you have to do?

684
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,980
 What do you have to do to grow any relationship?

685
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,820
 It takes time, communication,

686
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,520
 listening to one another, prioritizing.

687
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,020
 If you're gonna experience growing

688
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,020
 and being increasingly healthy, self-care,

689
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,060
 it will involve a growing relationship.

690
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,900
 You will prioritize spending time in God's word,

691
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420
 that's what I mean by listening.

692
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,500
 You will prioritize prayer.

693
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,120
 One of the things that is at the top of my list,

694
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,380
 dude, I just wanna pray more this year.

695
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,280
 I wanna continue to just develop the habit of,

696
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,800
 God, when my life is going crazy,

697
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,440
 will you help me turn to you?

698
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,740
 God, will you help me pray more?

699
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,980
 I'm about to walk into this meeting,

700
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,500
 I'm concerned about what they're gonna think about me,

701
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 or maybe I'm just anxious,

702
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,200
 or God, I can't fall asleep right now, will you help me?

703
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,580
 If you're gonna experience a growing relationship,

704
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,380
 it's gonna involve spending time in God's word,

705
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,660
 spending time in prayer,

706
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,380
 growing that relationship, priority,

707
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,620
 it's gonna involve work.

708
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,280
 There's no relationship, if you get married,

709
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,740
 or if you are married, there's no marriage out there

710
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,180
 that doesn't take work, relationships,

711
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,180
 take prioritization and work.

712
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,120
 And if you're gonna grow your relationship with Jesus,

713
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,780
 it's going to involve this happening.

714
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:52,440
 I think one of the craziest, or maybe the saddest thing,

715
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,900
 so when you read this, you're like, Jesus says,

716
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,540
 hey, drink the water I give you, you'll never thirst again.

717
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,280
 And there's a lot of Christians,

718
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,240
 because they don't practice what Jesus said

719
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,560
 of worshiping in spirit and in truth,

720
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,340
 worship constantly, having a relationship with God,

721
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,060
 because they don't practice that, they're thirsty.

722
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,380
 Like you may be a Christian in the room,

723
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,900
 and you're like, dude, I believe in that,

724
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,860
 yeah, the whole Jesus thing,

725
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,500
 yeah, Jesus satisfied thirst, yeah, that's great,

726
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,180
 I'm in on that, but I'm still empty.

727
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,580
 There's still part of me that just feels like empty.

728
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,060
 And it's because you are not taking advantage

729
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,220
 of what you have access to, a relationship with God.

730
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,120
 You're not prioritizing your relationship,

731
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,300
 spending time in His word, spending time with Him,

732
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,280
 walking with God's people.

733
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,080
 You have access to something that you've started,

734
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,560
 but you're not consistently applying it to your life.

735
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,800
 It's not dissimilar to this.

736
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,960
 Remember, I talked about the chiropractor,

737
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,580
 so I went, and while I was there,

738
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,680
 I went three times, like in a few days,

739
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,840
 and it was like, dude, this is awesome, amazing.

740
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
 And they were like, yeah, if you sign up

741
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,800
 for 70 bucks a month, you can have an unlimited pass.

742
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,440
 I'm like, unlimited pass, I can come in here any time?

743
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,340
 Unlimited pass, done, sign on the dotted line.

744
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,400
 I haven't been back since.

745
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,920
 I need to go cancel it, but you can't do it over the phone.

746
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,920
 And it had been a year, I kept the membership.

747
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,320
 And you came up to me and you were like,

748
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,040
 hey, you mentioned the chiropractor thing,

749
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,760
 how's that going, still a believer,

750
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,960
 I'm thinking about doing it myself,

751
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,440
 and I was like, you know, it worked initially,

752
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,600
 but it really hasn't worked since.

753
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,880
 I mean, I haven't been back since,

754
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,700
 but I don't know that I would really encourage

755
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,760
 anyone to do that, you would say

756
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,740
 the problem is not with chiropractors,

757
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,160
 it's that you're not going.

758
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,160
 You're not taking advantage of what you have access to.

759
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,640
 The problem is not that Jesus doesn't bring satisfaction,

760
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,620
 the problem is that you are not taking advantage

761
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,800
 of what you have access to,

762
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,120
 and if you're gonna experience self-care,

763
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,920
 it's gonna involve an ongoing relationship,

764
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,520
 that's what God, it says in the text,

765
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,320
 the Father is seeking you.

766
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,200
 Not for you to do some deed once a week

767
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,840
 and religious act, to have a relationship with you.

768
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,980
 That's what God is seeking.

769
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,180
 And if you're gonna experience that,

770
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,880
 like here's the problem, a lot of people in the world

771
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,320
 are like, yeah, I'm kind of, you know,

772
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,400
 I'm a follower of Jesus, I believe in him,

773
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,940
 living water, great, and I'm kind of experiencing

774
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,880
 my purpose, it's 'cause you're kind of following Jesus.

775
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,180
 Hey, I'm kind of experiencing peace,

776
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,920
 it's 'cause you're kind of following Jesus,

777
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,880
 which I may not even really be following Jesus.

778
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,060
 And he's inviting you, man, I want you to experience

779
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,500
 the life you were made for.

780
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,300
 But it's gonna involve prioritizing, spending time with me.

781
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,020
 In summary, just this idea that self-care

782
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,520
 without Christ won't last.

783
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,560
 Self-care with Christ brings soul care,

784
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,560
 and self-care with Christ is an ongoing relationship.

785
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,020
 When I was in college, my senior year,

786
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,640
 we had the final spring break, which was so sad.

787
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,180
 Just 'cause you don't get those anymore.

788
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,100
 And my roommates, we were deciding what to do,

789
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:13,620
 and there was this girl that I was all interested in,

790
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,820
 and I knew where she and her friends

791
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,100
 were going for spring break, so I was like,

792
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,900
 guys, hey, look, beach, it's gonna be great.

793
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,940
 Her and her friends were going to Destin, Florida,

794
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,300
 we weren't dating, and I was like,

795
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,380
 we should go to Destin, Florida.

796
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,780
 How great would that be?

797
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,780
 And they're like, with all the families?

798
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,260
 And I'm like, it's gonna be great.

799
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,860
 Good family experience together.

800
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:36,000
 And convinced them, we were gonna go to Alabama,

801
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,140
 and convinced them to go way out of our way

802
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,020
 just 'cause there was a relationship with this girl,

803
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,280
 who's now my wife, that, yeah, I know,

804
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,220
 that's gonna be closing prayer, okay?

805
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,740
 And just wanted everyone to know.

806
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,500
 (congregation laughing)

807
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,900
 That I was going out of my way to seek

808
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,540
 to be in a relationship with her.

809
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:02,120
 This text, over and over, talks about seeking.

810
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,200
 There's a woman, and she's seeking to fill a void

811
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,220
 that her relationships can't meet.

812
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,140
 And she's trying one after the next after the next,

813
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,100
 and she's still empty, she's thirsty inside, she's seeking.

814
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,580
 It says that Jesus was seeking her.

815
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,860
 I mean, think about how it started.

816
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,780
 Jesus had to go to Samaria.

817
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,700
 Think about that sentence for a second.

818
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,940
 You had to?

819
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,020
 You're Jesus.

820
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,520
 You don't have to do anything.

821
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,260
 And he woke up that morning and said, I've gotta go,

822
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,700
 there's a woman I'm gonna go meet.

823
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,360
 She's the outcast of outcasts.

824
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,020
 She's the woman that no one wants to have anything to do with

825
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,360
 but the Son of God.

826
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,700
 And he woke up with her on his mind.

827
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,220
 He was seeking a relationship with her.

828
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,180
 The very first person in all of the Bible

829
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
 that Jesus says, I'm the Messiah,

830
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,620
 is the most relationally dysfunctional person

831
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,740
 in all of the Bible.

832
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,760
 And he says, I haven't given up on you.

833
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,340
 And she believed that day.

834
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,980
 And the story goes on, and all of her life was changed.

835
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,260
 Because it was a man who was seeking,

836
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,340
 and she responded to that.

837
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,180
 No, no, they didn't say that.

838
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,380
 It says the Father is seeking a relationship with you.

839
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,220
 Here's what I know.

840
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,500
 If you're inside of the room right now,

841
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,620
 there's a God who wants something so much more for you

842
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,980
 than just a message on Tuesday night

843
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,420
 or a worship song on Tuesday night.

844
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,780
 He wants a relationship with you.

845
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,460
 And from the very first breath you took in our planet,

846
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,540
 he's been seeking you.

847
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,060
 Until the last day that you live on our planet,

848
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,860
 he will be seeking you.

849
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,680
 How do I know that?

850
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,200
 Because the very same word that it says,

851
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,980
 Jesus had to go to Samaria,

852
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,500
 is used in Matthew chapter 16,

853
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,980
 where Jesus looked at Jerusalem

854
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,620
 and he said, "I have to go to Jerusalem to die

855
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,380
 "on behalf of the human race,

856
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,180
 "on behalf of every person that's ever sat

857
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,060
 "in any one of these seats,

858
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,420
 "who's ever lived on this planet."

859
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,460
 If you're listening to me right now,

860
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,740
 there's a God who was there who is seeking you.

861
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,620
 You woke up this morning and he is crazy about you.

862
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,540
 He's seeking you.

863
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,020
 You think that there is a God out there,

864
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,940
 that if he's there,

865
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,920
 I don't think he wants anything to do with me.

866
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,180
 I'm a porn addict, I'm an abortion.

867
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,620
 I've had an abortion.

868
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,260
 I was a part of telling someone to have an abortion.

869
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,180
 I'm an addict.

870
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,060
 And you think the God who's there

871
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,300
 doesn't want anything to do with you.

872
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,860
 You don't want anything to do with you.

873
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,360
 And he's crazy about you.

874
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,720
 And he is doing everything he can to seek out,

875
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,620
 not so that you would just trust in him,

876
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,840
 though that is enough,

877
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,940
 so that you would walk with him

878
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,060
 and have a relationship with him this year.

879
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,500
 My prayer for you, my prayer for this message would be,

880
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,220
 God, would you awaken us to have an ongoing,

881
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,740
 constant, growing relationship with you?

882
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,860
 Where we experience our spirit and in truth relationship

883
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,820
 with the Father who's there, who's been seeking you.

884
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,740
 Even right now, there are some of you that are here

885
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
 and a friend invited you

886
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,380
 and you thought you were going to the porch restaurant

887
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,920
 and you're like, what are we doing here?

888
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,820
 The Father is seeking you.

889
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,940
 He has not forgotten you.

890
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,060
 He is crazy about you.

891
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,780
 He has given his life for you.

892
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,580
 Because just like he had to go to Samaria,

893
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,600
 he says, I have to go to the cross

894
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,300
 because for the joy set before him,

895
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,640
 Hebrews chapter 12 says, he died for you.

896
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,660
 And so I don't know where you are.

897
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,160
 I don't know what you believe.

898
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,040
 But there is one man who can satisfy the desires

899
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,880
 of your soul, you were made for it.

900
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,540
 And there is no other well that can.

901
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:26,980
 And tonight, he is seeking you

902
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,360
 and reaching in your direction, all of our direction

903
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,360
 and inviting us to walk and accept him

904
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,800
 and walk with him in relationship.

905
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,640
 Let me pray.

906
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,060
 (soft music)

907
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:50,960
 Father, thank you that you are a God

908
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,960
 who goes out of your way for sinful, broken people

909
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,560
 like me, like this woman who had no idea

910
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,080
 what she was gonna encounter that day,

911
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,700
 but she just went to get water and avoid people.

912
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,680
 There was a God who couldn't avoid meeting her.

913
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,240
 And I pray for friends in the room

914
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,960
 who have never accepted that,

915
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,960
 who have never come to just acknowledge or understand

916
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,640
 that you are not there demanding

917
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,160
 some sort of sacraments from us,

918
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,960
 but you gave a sacrifice for us by giving your life

919
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,240
 and dying in our place to pay for all the sins

920
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,760
 in our past and our present.

921
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,320
 And no matter our story, you're not done with us.

922
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,800
 And you have been pursuing us

923
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,080
 in ways that we can't even fully see now.

924
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,080
 But we for sure can see the pursuit of you on the cross.

925
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,480
 And so Lord, for anyone who's never put their faith

926
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,880
 in Christ tonight, I pray that tonight would be their night.

927
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,920
 They would not leave their seat,

928
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,880
 they would not leave this building

929
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,700
 without coming to a confident place in their faith in you.

930
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,440
 I pray that you would allow those of us

931
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,420
 with one foot in the world and one foot out of it

932
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,900
 that are kind of following Jesus

933
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,240
 and kind of experiencing peace

934
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
 to take a step in your direction.

935
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,580
 (gentle music)

936
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,440
 And experience self-care,

937
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,320
 the self-care they're looking for.

938
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,360
 That the truth is, there's a self-care

939
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,080
 that's been looking for us,

940
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,160
 despite the fact that we didn't even realize it.

941
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,260
 A self-care by the name of Christ.

942
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,800
 Thank you that you're a God who seeks.

943
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,160
 We worship you now in song.

944
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:40,160
