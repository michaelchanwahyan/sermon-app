[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:22.780]   All right.
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.560]   Well, hey, welcome everybody in the room
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.000]   and everybody tuning in from wherever you are.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.360]   Get excited.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.400]   We've got two new locations launching tonight.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.000]   Lafayette, Louisiana is launching
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.800]   in the second Indianapolis location,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.680]   because Indianapolis is growing so fast.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.760]   And so to those welcome in every other PortsLive location
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.120]   and everybody in the room, we are
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.160]   kicking off a dating series.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.440]   It is about to get real, people.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040]   And my hope-- I'll just be up front--
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440]   I hope as many of you as possible
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120]   start dating and get married because of this series.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.280]   And so I'm like, I am this close to making a Ports dating app.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.240]   And that's not true, and the liability would be terrible.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.920]   So let me start by giving us some tracks for where
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   we're going to go as we walk through this series
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.880]   on Datable.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.120]   And that really is our heart.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.680]   And our heart also is to not see anybody date and get married
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.000]   that is not doing so in a way that would honor God
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.800]   or with someone that is not the type of person
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.040]   that God wants them to be with.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.160]   But let me start like this.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.920]   A few months ago, I was out--
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.280]   and I shared before--
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.760]   I was out longboarding with my son, which clearly I'm
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.600]   too old to do.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.320]   Fell down, broke my hand, fractured it, went to the doctor,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.960]   said they got to get surgery.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.720]   And this was--
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.880]   I hadn't had a surgery like this in a while.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.680]   And because COVID, there was all kinds of new restrictions
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.680]   and checklist stuff that I had to do in order
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.400]   to get the surgery.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.920]   So she said, we need to have the surgery this week.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.600]   So over the next four days, I'm going
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.920]   to give you a checklist of things that you need to do.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.400]   And that includes every single day,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.800]   you've got to take your temperature two different
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.360]   times.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.120]   You've got to go to this specific location
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.000]   and get tested to make sure that we get the results back
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   from the PCR test beforehand.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.760]   And then the day before, there's a whole checklist
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.080]   of certain things that you can eat and you can't eat,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.840]   and time that you have to have before or from your last meal
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.600]   into the surgery.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.080]   And so she said, you can't have anything after 8 PM.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.400]   And make sure that you don't have anything that morning.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.720]   Surgery was around early afternoon the next day.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.600]   And I'm walking through this, and she's going,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.920]   follow each of these checklists.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.520]   And I'm like, you can't drink anything.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.440]   And immediately, you know when you don't really
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.160]   care about having water in the morning,
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.800]   and then somebody tells you you can't have water for 12 hours,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.840]   and you begin to get thirsty right there.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.000]   You're like, how am I going to go for that long without water?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.680]   Like, I can't take a sip of water?
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.720]   What's going to happen if I take a sip of water?
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.720]   And she begins to explain the anesthesia,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.320]   if you have anything in your system, it can come back.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.720]   And I'm like, what's the worst that could possibly happen?
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.800]   She says, we won't do the surgery, sir.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.840]   And explains that if you were to do that,
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.720]   and you had something in your system,
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.920]   because all of your organs are put to sleep,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.720]   it can have real complications that lead to death,
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.760]   which feels extreme for a glass of water.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.640]   But it's what I was told.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.120]   And so she said, make sure you follow this checklist.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.080]   If not, you will not be having surgery,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.200]   because you will not be ready to have surgery,
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.760]   and we will have to reschedule your surgery.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.800]   Now, what does that have to do with dating?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.080]   Well, when it comes to the topic of dating,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.240]   the Bible, surprise, doesn't talk about it,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.360]   because dating has not been around for very long.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.440]   It's a relatively new invention, around 100 years.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.000]   But the Bible has a lot to say about the topics of romance,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   marriage, sex, evaluation, decision-making.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.560]   And so when we do a series like this,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.320]   our heart really is to take God's word and equip you
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.780]   and prepare you to be dateable,
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.560]   to be someone who is ready not just to date
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.920]   like the world and culture around us says,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.160]   but to date in line with God's word,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.680]   who he says and as he says.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.800]   And so tonight, I wanna walk through a checklist
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.040]   of not to prepare you for surgery,
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.240]   but to prepare you for dating.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.200]   And the subject of this evening is, are you dateable?
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.960]   Now, that's a question you probably have never asked yourself
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.640]   but it's a really important question,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.600]   'cause the world around you is just gonna say,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.420]   are you dateable?
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.460]   If you're available, you're dateable.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.800]   But the Bible would say,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.700]   because you're dealing with the subject of your heart,
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.680]   of another person's heart,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.480]   of the person who's gonna be a spouse,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.300]   a relationship that is meant to be till death do you part,
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.800]   you need to make sure you go into that
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.360]   prepared and ready to date.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.160]   Aside from deciding to follow Jesus,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.720]   the most important decision you're gonna make
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.920]   is who your spouse is.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.360]   There's a lot of decisions you're gonna make,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.480]   you may put pressure on yourself,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.320]   should I go to grad school,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.580]   should I not move to this town,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.680]   should I move over here,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.440]   should I move out of this apartment?
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   Those are important decisions,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.920]   but there really is not many things in life
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.680]   that you can't undo,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.680]   or that are decisions that you could change jobs
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.040]   and change careers, change industries,
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.560]   and then change back, you can undo it.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.500]   There's some things that are very, very costly to undo.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.440]   One of them is marriage.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.480]   80% of you will get married statistically by age 35,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.600]   which means when you combine that
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.520]   with the average age of getting married
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.800]   is around 29 and 30,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.880]   the vast majority of you in the room will be married
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.360]   and making the single most important decision
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.640]   next following Jesus that you will make in your life
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.160]   in the next seven years, five to seven years.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.120]   I mean, think about the impact that your parents
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   and them deciding to get married had on your life.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.720]   I mean, you are picking your family.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.800]   People say you pick your friends, can't pick your family.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.640]   That's not true.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.720]   You will pick your family
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.900]   because you are picking who will be the mother
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:20.740]   of your children.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.360]   You are picking who will be the father of your children.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.040]   You're picking the person
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.120]   who you're gonna spend more time with
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.160]   than any other person on the planet.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.620]   And so when we come into this thing called dating,
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.160]   we need to make sure that we are ready to date
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.520]   to put ourself in the best scenario possible
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.320]   to find the right person, to date in the right way.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.940]   So tonight I wanna walk through a checklist
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.140]   of how you can know, am I dateable?
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.560]   And be equipped and prepared.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.320]   And to also know, if I discover I'm not,
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.880]   practical things that God would say,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.600]   here are steps that are gonna set you up
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   to experience the best marriage someday
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.280]   in dating pursuit today or someday.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.120]   So we're gonna walk through and look at five different things.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.400]   We're gonna jump through scripture
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.640]   and look at five different marks of the checklist,
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   the things that if you are interested in dating,
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.180]   you need to make sure you have checked off the list.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.640]   Five different aspects of the checklist of am I dateable?
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.580]   Am I ready to date?
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.800]   Not will somebody ask me on a date?
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.280]   Not could I go on a date?
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.240]   Not am I dating anyone?
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.960]   But am I dateable and in a spot
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.360]   where it would be wise for me to continue going?
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.680]   So first idea I wanna walk through
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.920]   as we look through these five is number one.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.900]   First thing to check is check your preparation.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.520]   In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul lays out
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.040]   that this is a season, singleness.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.760]   If you're single, which most of us are in the room,
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.480]   this is a season that is given by God uniquely
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.080]   to do a couple things.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.440]   And it's a season that is preparing you to become
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.520]   the husband, the father, the mother, the wife
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.820]   that you are going to be someday.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.800]   You are becoming that right now.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.080]   And it's a season where you can use it to prepare.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.520]   1 Corinthians 7, verse seven says this, Paul speaking,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.080]   "I wish everyone was single as I am.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.260]   "Yet each person has a special gift from God
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.200]   "of one kind or another."
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.720]   Paul says, he's talking about singleness.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.040]   Hey, I wish everybody was single like I am.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.420]   In the context, he's saying so that they could,
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.080]   with all of their life, devote to sharing
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.080]   the gospel around them.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.820]   And he says, hey, I've got my gift.
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.660]   I know everybody.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.800]   I'm not saying everyone has to be single.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.200]   I wish everybody was because then the gospel
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.920]   could move further and faster.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.080]   But he says, everybody has different gifts.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.920]   And this is my gift.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.800]   And Paul describes singleness as a gift,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.640]   which most of us in the room, or a lot of us,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.040]   would be like, if this is a gift,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.560]   I would like to explore a return policy.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.320]   But Paul is saying it's a gift.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.440]   And later in the chapter, he explains,
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.720]   here's why it's a gift.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.080]   It's a unique season that you have.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.860]   And he explains that in verse 35.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.520]   "This I say for your own benefit,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.940]   "not to put a restraint on you,
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.680]   "but to promote in singleness what is appropriate,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.340]   "or appropriate behavior,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.680]   "and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord."
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.640]   Paul says, hey, you have a season of singleness
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.200]   that for most of you, like I already said,
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.440]   80% of you will get married.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.660]   Which means it is a season.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.540]   And Paul said, this is a season
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.800]   that provides you the opportunity to produce,
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.660]   or have God produce in you appropriate behavior,
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.840]   and secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.720]   In other words, to use to prepare you
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.200]   for whatever God has ahead in your story,
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.280]   and to prepare you for marriage,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.880]   to prepare you for what someday,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.360]   that relationship with husband, wife,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   that you are going to be.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.440]   So what does it look like to prepare?
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.360]   Well, it involves promoting appropriate behavior,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.560]   would be one of the things that Paul says.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.600]   What does that look like?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.840]   Here's three different things that it looks like.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   The first one, it means in this season,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.880]   I'm gonna prioritize if I'm single.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.200]   I'm prioritizing my relationship with Jesus.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.020]   He just said, you have a unique season
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.200]   that will allow you to secure undistracted
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.320]   devotion to the Lord.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.060]   It will allow you to deepen in your relationship with God.
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.660]   The season you're in is a unique one
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.240]   that you will never have again,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.200]   or hopefully will never have again,
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.520]   because you have a chance to spend more time
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.200]   prioritizing your relationship with God,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.680]   studying God's word in the morning,
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.880]   and kids are not crying, coming to you saying,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.720]   I need some milk, or breakfast, or Capri Sun,
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.800]   or just screaming their heads off
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.940]   'cause their pacifier is out.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.720]   You can wake up, you can have a quiet time.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.940]   You can go on mission trips.
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.600]   You can spend weekends serving and knowing God,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.020]   and deepening in your faith, and building a foundation
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.960]   that you're gonna build a marriage and a life on
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   for the rest of the rest.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.380]   How do you promote what is wise?
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.520]   What is the best way to prepare in this season?
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.480]   It is to prioritize my relationship with Jesus.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.200]   I'm gonna sow seeds that for the rest of my life,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.360]   they're gonna be growing
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.960]   because of the way that I invested this time of singleness.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.880]   You may not believe it.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.000]   You may think you're busy.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.640]   You may think, man, I have so much going on.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.320]   Wait until you are married and you have children.
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.840]   Whatever you think is busy, I look back and I'm like,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.920]   what did I do with my life?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.000]   And it sounds crazy, and I sat in a room like this,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.520]   and I would hear people say things like that,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.320]   of this is a unique time where you're gonna have
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.960]   more disposable time than any other,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.360]   and I would go, man, you don't know me, bro.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.200]   I'm so busy.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.880]   And now I look back and I'm like,
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.020]   I should've, I was such an idiot.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:43.920]   You have more time and availability to serve the Lord
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.280]   and to use it growing and prioritizing your relationship,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.960]   which is a part of preparing you
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.780]   for a relationship with a spouse.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.040]   In other words, you're not gonna get a relationship
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.560]   with a guy or girl right until you get
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.200]   the relationship with God right.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.800]   Side note, on the question of, hey, am I dateable?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.520]   If you are not a Christian, no,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.320]   because you haven't gotten the relationship with God right,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.420]   which should be the first priority.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.320]   What does it mean to be a Christian?
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.280]   Quickly, it means accepting the gospel,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.400]   which means good news, that Jesus came into the world
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.400]   2,000 years ago.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.600]   He was God in human form.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.360]   He died on a cross for your sin
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.320]   and a payment for your sin
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.120]   and every wrong that you've ever done.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.960]   And by accepting God, I'm not good enough,
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.720]   but you paid for me on the cross.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.200]   Through that, we're told, just like Jesus rose from the dead
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.600]   you will rise from the dead and have eternal life,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.640]   a relationship with God.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.160]   Those of us who are, this is the season
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.880]   where we prioritize getting to know him.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.020]   What's the second part of preparing well in this season?
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.080]   Dealing with hurts.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.640]   This is huge.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.920]   Dealing with hurts.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.440]   Is there anyone in your life who you haven't forgiven?
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.960]   Now, I'm sure if I heard your story, it would make sense
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.320]   and I would feel such empathy and compassion and hate it
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.160]   and you didn't deserve it and whatever happened.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.400]   But if you carry bitterness, you are not ready to date
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.920]   because you're not ready to get married,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.420]   which is what dating leads to.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.040]   When I meet with couples and I do premarital counseling,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.320]   for anybody whose wedding I'm gonna do,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.640]   I ask a question every single time.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.840]   Is there any, I ask this question,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.600]   is there anyone in your life that you haven't forgiven?
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.400]   And oftentimes, they'll say, you know, my father,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.820]   parent, somebody distant.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.360]   And I'll look at them and as lovingly as I can,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.260]   I say, I can't do your wedding unless you forgive them.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.400]   Why would you be so mean, David?
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.380]   Well, the Bible says over and over
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.280]   that you and I as Christians, we are called to forgive
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   as Christ forgives us over and over and over.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.840]   I mean, one example is Colossians 3, 13.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.220]   You can find it in Ephesians 4, Matthew 18,
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.700]   over the Lord's Prayer.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.940]   But here it says, "Bear with each other
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.000]   "and forgive one another
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.600]   "if any of you has a grievance against someone.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.160]   "Forgive as the Lord forgave you."
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.300]   You and I are called to forgive people.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.140]   Why would it be bad to go into marriage
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.700]   and hold bitterness against somebody that's not my husband?
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.540]   I mean, I'm not marrying a family member that hurt me,
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.980]   I'm marrying him, I'm marrying her.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.660]   Why is that bad?
[00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.340]   If you develop the habit of picking up hurts
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.140]   and holding onto them, hey, when I get hurt, I hold on.
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.500]   When I get hurt, I hold this bitterness,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.260]   hold it against that person.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.820]   Creates a wedge for me and that person.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.340]   You are flexing the muscle of holding bitterness.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.060]   In marriage, you are stepping into a relationship
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.220]   that is the most intimate relationship you're gonna have.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.660]   And the deeper the intimacy in any relationship,
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.300]   the deeper the pain is when they hurt you.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.420]   You're stepping into a relationship
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.660]   with another sinner just like you.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.580]   And marriage, healthy marriages,
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.580]   are the process of choosing to forgive
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.060]   someone who deeply hurts you over and over and over,
[00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.580]   like Christ forgave us.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.020]   Not to stay in an abusive environment,
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.780]   but to choose, I'm going to forgive this person.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.400]   Billy Graham famously said when he was asked
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.460]   what makes a great marriage, he said, "Two great forgivers."
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:14.300]   And so if you have not dealt with hurts,
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.860]   the best way you can prepare in this season
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.740]   is to say, man, I'm gonna work through,
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.620]   I'm gonna choose to forgive people.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.180]   I'm gonna work through that with my community,
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.100]   maybe through region.
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.780]   I'm gonna choose, I'm gonna sit down,
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.100]   I'm gonna forgive this person who really hurt me.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.820]   A third way this season is one
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.620]   to uniquely prepare for marriage
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.020]   is to deal with toxic habits.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.420]   Is there something in your life that you're thinking,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.020]   man, when I get married, I'm sure this won't be a part of me,
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.900]   whether it's an eating disorder, maybe you're just a liar.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.580]   Like you just, you lie about little things.
[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.060]   You have never opened up.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.160]   You lie to your community.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.960]   You lie to the person you're dating.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.100]   Is there something in your life that you need to confess
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.020]   and get rid of and say, man, I need to bring this
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.540]   into light, I just want to work on this.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.100]   I don't want to be this person.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.660]   Because marriage is not gonna make that change.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.900]   It's not gonna make a porn addiction go away.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.420]   It's not gonna make the eating disorder that you turn to
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.540]   when you're stressed go away.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.540]   It'll just make it worse.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.220]   What's gonna make it go away is when you decide,
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.980]   I'm going to confess and repent and work through this.
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.180]   I'm gonna decide to work through this.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.440]   Maybe it's a gambling problem
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.580]   that you wouldn't even admit
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.060]   or you wouldn't even describe it that way,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.260]   but you kind of just turn to it
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.160]   and it's your outlet and your release.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.580]   What is the toxic habits that today
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.060]   you could decide I'm gonna give the gift to my spouse
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.820]   that I'm not carrying this into marriage.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.420]   I'm not bringing this in and making it,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.080]   it goes from my problem to our problem.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.060]   I am dealing with this today
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.620]   because I'm choosing to prepare for marriage.
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.580]   You know, it's crazy when it comes to marriage,
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.880]   we believe it's like, it will magically change us.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.100]   Man, I struggled with lust.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.140]   That's just 'cause I was single.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.280]   Then I got married, lust problem went away.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.340]   Marriage doesn't change anything,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.180]   but the fact that now you're married.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.060]   In other words, it doesn't make your problems go away.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.340]   It makes you have not single,
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.900]   being a single person in problems,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.060]   now you're a married person with problems
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.220]   and somebody else is invited into those problems.
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.100]   It doesn't change.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.500]   In other words, you put on a ring,
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.060]   stand in front, wear a white dress,
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.940]   the next day, nothing is different other than you're married.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.480]   It'll change your last name.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.780]   It won't change your toxic habits.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.680]   But you can decide today, I'm gonna work on those.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.280]   And you are deciding,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.040]   am I gonna choose to prepare for marriage?
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.040]   I'm gonna work through hurts.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.360]   I'm gonna work through toxic habits.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.480]   I'm gonna prioritize my relationship with God
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.040]   and choose to prepare well.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.700]   Or you can choose to not prepare.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.360]   And you know what will happen when you get married?
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.960]   You won't be prepared.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.720]   It's pretty profound.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.820]   I'll say it again.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.840]   If you choose not to prepare, you will get married
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.480]   and you won't be prepared for marriage.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.280]   I don't know why anybody would think differently
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.480]   as though like, man, marriage,
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.200]   then I'll get serious about God and that's gonna change.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.160]   It doesn't change anything except for your last name,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.140]   potentially, and your relationship status.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.040]   Like what other arena in life do we focus on,
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   hey, I'll be able to have victory or accomplish this,
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.080]   not because I prepared or I practiced,
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.940]   just 'cause I promise I'll be able to.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.000]   None.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.920]   We know that it doesn't work that way in school or education
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.760]   if I promise like, oh, I'm gonna get great grades.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.820]   You know what allows you to get great grades?
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.300]   Preparing.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.760]   In business or sports, no one would say,
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.000]   hey, our team, we're gonna win
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.360]   a national championship this year
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.000]   because we're just gonna promise that we're gonna do it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.020]   No more practices, guys, just go to the locker room
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.840]   and promise national championship, national championship.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.120]   It's a very fast way to lose your job if you're a head coach
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.840]   because we understand you could promise things all day,
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.240]   which is what saying I do is, a promise.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.560]   Promises don't matter
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.680]   if they don't have preparation behind them.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.460]   You are choosing today, am I gonna prepare
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.240]   to keep the promise, then I'm gonna make.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.720]   Everybody intends and wants to keep their promise.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.840]   I do, to the death's duest part.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.080]   They just don't prepare.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   And you can decide, I am going to choose to prepare.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.400]   There's a passage related to this,
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.640]   and we'll go to the second one,
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   on this idea of, I don't know where we buy the myth
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.880]   of like, man, marriage, I'll just wake up one day
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.980]   and I'll be different.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.560]   There's a passage on love that you've probably heard
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.600]   if you've gone to a wedding before
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.000]   and heard somebody read before,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.600]   or maybe you've read yourself before,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.760]   and in the passage, he takes a very interesting term
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.420]   towards the end of it, it's the love chapter.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.600]   You've heard people wonder, hey, is love a verb?
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.920]   Is it a noun?
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.320]   In this chapter, this is the love is a verb chapter.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.560]   First Corinthians 13, Apostle Paul, he defines love.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.620]   Look at the description that he says.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.640]   He says, "Love is patient.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.060]   "It's kind.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.600]   "It doesn't envy.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.120]   "It doesn't boast.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.960]   "It's not proud.
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.180]   "It doesn't dishonor other people.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.220]   "It's not self-seeking.
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.640]   "It's not easily angered.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.800]   "It keeps no record of wrongs."
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.360]   This is Paul describing, how can you know
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.860]   that you're operating in love?
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.960]   "Love doesn't delight in evil, it rejoices in the truth.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.800]   "It always protects.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.040]   "It always trusts.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.760]   "It always hopes and always perseveres."
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.120]   And then at the end of the section about love,
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.280]   the Apostle Paul does something that's really interesting
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.620]   and really, really relevant.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.640]   He begins to talk about his childhood,
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.000]   where he's like, this is what love is, this is what love is,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.120]   and he goes into, when I was a boy,
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.280]   and he begins to describe growing up, here's what he says.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.480]   "When I was a child, I talked like a child.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.320]   "I thought like a child, and I reasoned like a child.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.520]   "Like, hey, when I was a little kid,
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.360]   "when I was a little boy,"
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.640]   this is Paul talking about himself,
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.040]   "when I was a little boy, I was like a kid.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.880]   "I thought like a kid, thought like kids think.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.280]   "And then, when I became a man,
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.400]   "I put the ways of childhood behind me."
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.520]   When we're kids, I am currently in a stage
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.360]   where my kids are young,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.060]   and so you read books every night from bed,
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.440]   you're reading fairy tales to 'em,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.520]   and when you're a kid, you think and believe fairy tales.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.840]   You think those are true.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.280]   You think, you know, someday, maybe I could fly someday,
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.440]   wouldn't that be amazing?
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.480]   The way that you think and see the world,
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.600]   you just are still, you're not old enough to understand.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.960]   It's a fairy tale, it's a myth, it's not true.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.320]   Some of us have bought fairy tales and myths
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.080]   about love and about marriage and about romance
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.080]   that you've never abandoned or recognized.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.420]   That's a fairy tale.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.320]   Happily Ever After, that's a fairy tale.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.560]   That does not happen.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.840]   What happens in marriage is two people come together
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.800]   and they work to love each other
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.880]   and die to themselves ever after.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.520]   It's a much longer tagline than Happily Ever After,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.480]   but it's a much more true tagline.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.800]   Equally as true is a fairy tale
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   that marriage is gonna change and make your problems go away.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.200]   Marriage doesn't make your problems go away.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.580]   Deciding I'm gonna prepare for marriage
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.280]   is how you and I work through the problems
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.580]   that one day are gonna attempt to get in your way
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.760]   of that relationship with the other person.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.040]   How are you preparing in this season?
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.320]   If you're not preparing well, you are not dateable.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.600]   Second idea, check your pattern.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   So check your pattern, check your preparation,
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.120]   check your pattern.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.940]   What is a pattern?
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.580]   You have a past, you have a pattern of dating.
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.900]   If you dated anybody, you likely have,
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.700]   or you do have a pattern.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.200]   We all have 'em and there's certain things
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.680]   just from our past that we gravitate towards.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.000]   What is the patterns of your life,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.540]   of your dating relationships?
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.360]   The different ways that you end up in dysfunctional,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.320]   messed up relationships, the cycles
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.720]   that are part of your love life story.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.640]   In Proverbs chapter 14, verse 15, it says,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.480]   "The simple believe anything,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.240]   "but a wise person or a prudent
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.800]   "gives thoughts to their steps."
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.900]   What is your pattern?
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.700]   Do you know it?
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.700]   Because if you don't accept it, you can't address it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.460]   Do you know, what is your pattern of dating?
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.520]   Here's something I wrote.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:29.260]   Some of you only date passive men
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.580]   because your dad was controlling.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.540]   And so now you think, I so did not like that.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.540]   I want someone who's passive,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.100]   who I'm kind of the boss in this relationship.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.460]   Or your dad was passive, and so you're looking
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.480]   for someone that is passive,
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.460]   which is not coming out of a healthy
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.180]   place, but a broken place.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.720]   You're looking for qualities and characteristics
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.760]   that are not the ones God says to look for.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.440]   Some of you, you don't like being in a relationship
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   with somebody if the other person,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.880]   or if you like the other person more than they like you.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.800]   In other words, you're comfortable
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.520]   in a dating relationship, and you'll continue
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.920]   in the dating relationship as long as they like you
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.000]   more than you like them.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.840]   Do you know why?
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.400]   Because you're afraid of rejection.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.640]   And it allows you to have some semblance of control
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.440]   of man, I know that this girl's so into me,
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.640]   or he's so into me that I can decide
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.760]   if I ever wanna walk away, 'cause she never will.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.280]   And you know why?
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.480]   It's because you're afraid of rejection.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   You're operating from fear, not from a healthy place.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.520]   We all have patterns.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.880]   Some of you, candidly, girls, you've stayed
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:45.280]   in relationships in your past way too long.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.000]   And you took behavior that was not just rude,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   it was borderline abusive, harsh, mean,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.200]   and you took it, and you allowed other people
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.660]   to treat badly because you thought badly of yourself.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.900]   And there's a pattern there, that hey,
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.100]   you're gonna be prone to do that.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.780]   And unless you say, man, I need to evaluate
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.880]   all the different broken patterns that are in my life.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.960]   If I'm gonna change them, I can't address
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.460]   what I haven't accepted is there.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.760]   Some of you, you get in a relationship,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.800]   and I just want you to think about this,
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.760]   'cause this is a very common one.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.840]   You get in a relationship and you start dating somebody.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   Like, it's going great, she's a cute girl.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.160]   I'm gonna talk to the guys here for a second.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.640]   This feels like a guy thing.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.160]   She's a cute girl, man, I'm interested in dating her.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.080]   You go on one date, things are good.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.520]   You know, I just didn't feel all the sparks flying,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.320]   but she seems nice, and she's a cute girl,
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.560]   and she checks the box on all the qualities that I want.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.400]   I'll go on a second date.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.920]   Go on a second date, yeah, same thing.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.240]   I'm just not really feeling it.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.400]   Third date, you kind of get a few dates in.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:53.320]   And you begin to go, I mean, everything on paper's great.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.580]   I just don't know if I'm feeling it,
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.000]   or if I want to date her.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.280]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.720]   There's so many baked in assumptions
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.900]   in your decision to break up with that person.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:06.700]   I'm not even telling you it's wrong, but just stay with me.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.700]   I'm going on a very narrow path to take you somewhere, okay?
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.680]   In that moment, you are assuming
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.240]   that I should have some level of fireworks,
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.200]   whatever that means,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.380]   and a feeling of emotion towards this person.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.200]   If I was to ask you to write out
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.720]   what would fireworks look like,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.840]   you wouldn't say fireworks.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.000]   You would say, I don't know,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.960]   like some butterflies or something in there,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.400]   and you would struggle to articulate
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.720]   what you were deeming a criteria for a relationship
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.880]   that must take place.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   I'm not even saying you're wrong or in sin.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.400]   I'm just saying you owe it to yourself
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.600]   to at least say, huh, I can't even tell myself
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.040]   why I don't want to keep dating this girl
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.120]   that's perfect on paper,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.920]   and Jesus says would be a great wife.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.440]   Something to think about.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.960]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.580]   Something to think about.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.680]   I don't know what your pattern is,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.800]   but I know if you have any level of dating relationship,
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.160]   you have one.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.300]   And in order to address it,
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.200]   you gotta first identify it and accept,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.080]   like hey, this is my tendency.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.360]   And then you bring it into other guys
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.640]   or girls in your life and community.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.760]   You're like, hey, this is my tendency.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.480]   I get kind of far in,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.320]   and then I'm like, man, I'm just afraid.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.360]   I kind of have the commitment fear, so I'm out.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   And so you gotta bring that to other guys in your life,
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.720]   your guy, other girls in your life.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.800]   You gotta talk about it and say, hey, here's my temptation.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.680]   This is my ditch.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.760]   Hold me accountable.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.020]   'Cause if not, that pattern ain't going away.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.680]   So flip golf carts from time to time,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   and we'll buy a golf cart, try to trick it out,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.200]   and sell it and not lose money.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.280]   Not long ago, I bought one, and the alignment was off.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.120]   And by alignment, alignment is the thing
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.320]   that allows you to drive straight.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.440]   If the alignment is off, you'll start driving,
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.600]   and it'll just immediately go to the right.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.780]   So the alignment was totally off.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.120]   So every time I got in the car,
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.120]   I had to compensate by pulling the steering wheel
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.100]   way far over in order for it to drive straight.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:08.160]   Because on its own, it was just gonna keep going
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.560]   in that direction, 'cause its alignment was off.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:17.680]   If you don't identify, hey, I got an alignment that's off.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.320]   This is just where I go in isolation, in neutral.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.560]   I just drift towards.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.480]   Man, I get in, things are going well,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.120]   and I get deuces 'cause I get nervous,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.400]   and I've never even told anybody that,
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.120]   but I just have some relationship problems,
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.000]   or I get in the relationship, and I allow myself,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.560]   because I don't wanna lose the other person,
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.800]   to go farther physically than God's word says.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.900]   I need some help and accountability there.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.400]   If you don't begin to work on those patterns,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.560]   they're not going away.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.760]   They're just gonna continue, continue,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.560]   and continue resurfacing.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.280]   I hear from girls all the time.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.680]   Now I'm leaning into the girls.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.920]   Why are guys just such jerks?
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.280]   Every guy in the world, he's either a jerk,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.720]   or he's totally unattractive.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   This is who they are.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.000]   It's true.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.640]   It's true.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.040]   Here's something I want you to consider.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:07.880]   Stay with me.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.700]   Wait right here.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.960]   In those conversations, they always go one way of like,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.920]   hey, tell me about who you're dating, and she'll describe.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.600]   He was just such a jerk, and he was just such a jerk,
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.000]   and he was just such a jerk.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.120]   Could it be that it's not that the world
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.960]   is as simple as unattractive or jerk,
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.520]   but that you are only attracted to jerks?
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.920]   Hold on.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.520]   Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.440]   Yeah, bring it up.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.560]   That's good.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.920]   Good night, everybody!
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.360]   Here's why I say that.
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:52.320]   You had jerk John, jerk Jerry, jerk Mark.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   You had dating relationships with all of them.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.160]   Who is the common denominator in all those relationships?
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.100]   You.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.160]   I'm not trying to pick on you.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.000]   I'm saying, could it be that there is something
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.240]   dysfunctional in you that is drawn to someone like that?
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.160]   I don't know what it is, but I know you gotta get down.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.800]   What are the dysfunction of my dating pattern and past?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.240]   Because a dysfunctional pattern reveals or reflects
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.080]   a dysfunctional personal issue
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.560]   that you gotta get to the root of,
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.880]   have communities begin to, and work through.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.200]   If you have not worked through,
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.440]   and you don't even know your pattern,
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.240]   you may not be dateable,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.340]   but you need to prioritize working through that.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.640]   Speaking of priorities, third idea is you need
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.600]   to check your priorities.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.120]   I'm gonna move quickly through this one,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.440]   that you, as a believer, what are the priorities?
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.120]   What are the things, if you were to put a list together,
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.760]   and I could give you a piece of paper right now,
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.720]   if I was sitting down with you, and I was like,
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.800]   hey, write on paper everything you want in a spouse,
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.280]   or everything in the person you wanna date,
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.800]   hopefully marry someday, write 'em out.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.240]   And you know what your list would include?
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   It would include things like, I want him to be witty,
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.680]   'cause you know, I'm not that witty,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.920]   and I just like a little personality, and I,
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.680]   he's gotta be 6'2" or taller, 'cause I'm 5'9",
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.220]   and I like to wear heels, okay?
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.440]   And you could list out all the things,
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.360]   or you go, I want her to be a blonde,
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.920]   or I want her to be a little reserved,
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.120]   'cause I'm not outgoing, or I like someone who,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.520]   you know, is kinda go with the flow,
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.600]   'cause I'm pretty buttoned up,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.760]   and you could give me your list.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.880]   It's fine, you could have a list.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.820]   Make the priorities of the top parts of your list
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.080]   the right ones, because all of the other ones,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.840]   I have never heard, I've never heard,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.600]   I've been doing this a long time,
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.200]   a couple get divorced because he wasn't witty enough.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.880]   (congregation laughs)
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   But I've heard over and over,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.680]   their relationship fall apart, because he was selfish,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.300]   she was emotionally abusive or absent.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.720]   And so you gotta make sure, what are the priorities?
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.680]   Like, these are the must-have non-negotiables.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.200]   Let me give you an example of a top priorities
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.000]   of somebody that you are not dateable.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.740]   We love you, we are glad you're here,
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.000]   you just need to work and meet with Jesus more
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.040]   in order to get ready to date.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.840]   Here's not dateable list of somebody.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.360]   Here's on the not dateable priorities.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.600]   If these are your top priorities, you are not dateable.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.440]   Hot.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.680]   (congregation laughs)
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   Witty, high salary, outgoing, nice car.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.640]   (congregation laughs)
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.840]   On the dateable list, Jesus is their first love.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.960]   If the priorities in your life,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.180]   if Jesus is their first love,
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.520]   they are a member of a church,
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.880]   they're connected to a local church.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.480]   In other words, they look at God's word,
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   and it says, you and I are to be underneath,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.900]   connected to a local church,
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.320]   they actually listen and obey that,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.000]   which tells you that they're actually gonna listen and obey
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.960]   the other commands in scripture
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.080]   about how they're to raise babies,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.060]   how they're to be a husband or wife.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.640]   They're humble, they're teacher.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.440]   This one is so huge.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.080]   When they're confronted with something, they're teachable.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.120]   They'll ask for forgiveness.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.280]   They're not perfect.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.920]   And you point out ways that they're not perfect,
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.960]   you go, I'm trying to work on that area,
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.100]   or thank you, will you please forgive me?
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:01.940]   They're humble.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.700]   They have strong character.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.700]   And they value marriage.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.960]   They value marriage the way God said,
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.620]   it is a lifelong covenant relationship together.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.560]   They have character.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.580]   In Proverbs chapter 12, verse four, it says,
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:25.580]   a spouse or wife or husband of noble character
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.400]   is her husband's crown.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   But a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.780]   What is the author saying there?
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.380]   He says, it's like, the crown is the most prized possession.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.700]   A wife or husband of noble character
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.200]   is like their spouses, this is my prized possession.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.280]   But one who is not, who doesn't have character,
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.780]   it's like it's rotting them from the inside.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.220]   It's pretty powerful.
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.320]   And the author says, man, you need to be so careful
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.700]   when you find someone of character.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.740]   It's weird, man, we prioritize the outside.
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.780]   That's what attracts us to people,
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.080]   we end up dating 'cause it's like the outside.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.220]   When the inside is the only thing that's sticking around.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.940]   In other words, the outside,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.260]   whatever they look like right now,
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.540]   it's not gonna look like what they look like in 20 years.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.020]   Hair will move from here to other places.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.740]   Stretch marks are gonna happen,
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.220]   just bodies are gonna change, wrinkles are gonna happen,
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.360]   no matter how much Botox they spray up, it's gonna happen.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.580]   Or inject, whatever it is.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.660]   Spray up.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:42.440]   The outside is going away, the inside is here to stay.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.860]   And we prioritize, there's so many of the wrong things.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.180]   Are there so many that will love you,
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.860]   like Ephesians 5 says, husbands love your wife
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.780]   like Christ loved the church,
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.180]   and that he laid down his life for her.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.740]   Or Husbands in Colossians 3,
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.780]   love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.380]   Sometimes even the thing that is on the top priority
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.700]   is how we feel, which is a really dangerous thing.
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.820]   Let me wrap this point up quickly.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.700]   Because you know where your feelings come from?
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.460]   They come from what the Bible would say is the heart.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.980]   And the heart can be really, really deceitful.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.980]   In other words, following your feelings
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.980]   is putting your life in the hands of something
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.260]   the Bible doesn't speak that well of
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.780]   when it comes to its ability to deceive.
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.700]   It says this, Jeremiah chapter 17, verse nine.
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.900]   Think about this verse.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:44.140]   The heart is deceitful above all things
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:50.040]   and beyond cure or utterly sick.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.260]   And Jeremiah writes, and he says,
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.260]   "The heart has the ability to deceive oneself
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.060]   "more than anything else in all of creation."
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.220]   It's pretty shocking.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:05.940]   This is why just following blindly the feelings
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.940]   and emotions that you have is a bad idea biblically,
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.340]   because you may love him,
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.740]   and you guys are infatuated together,
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.900]   and you're obsessed, and you got a song,
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.780]   and you got just dreams of all the visions
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.200]   of someday your home and little babies.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.520]   But if he's not a believer, you have deceived yourself.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.560]   And is it possible to fall in love
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.040]   with someone who's not a Christian if you're a Christian?
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.680]   Absolutely.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.240]   All you gotta have to fall in love is be breathing,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:38.440]   and then be breathing, period.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.280]   Staying in love is a much harder thing,
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   and that requires sharing the same priority
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.680]   of Jesus in your life.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.160]   He's your first love and their first love.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.760]   And so if your priorities and what you're looking for
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.560]   are not shaped by that, which is really hard,
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.920]   'cause candidly, a lot of you guys,
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.000]   you would say, "Yes, they are that."
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.300]   But you got deal breakers.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.000]   You say, "I'm not dating somebody shorter than me.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.240]   "I'm not dating a girl that has that much debt.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.300]   "I'm not dating somebody that wants to keep working
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.720]   "or wants to not work."
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.580]   And so you owe it to yourself to just say,
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.980]   "Here are my deal breakers."
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.280]   Say, "God, will you help me prioritize what you prioritize?"
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.200]   After you've checked your pattern, your priorities,
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.200]   and your preparation, the final thing is check your people.
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.080]   Do you have believers in your life,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.080]   a support system around you
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.960]   that is gonna be able to speak into in a godly way
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.360]   people that love you, that are for you?
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.120]   They're not just gonna tell you the relationship is great
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.040]   because they don't wanna hurt your feelings.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.180]   They're willing to tell you the truth,
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.240]   and they come along and they wanna celebrate
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.480]   and see you as somebody godly.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.520]   Do you have a community group, a small group?
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.320]   You need to check your people
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.560]   and make sure that they are the right people.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.800]   In order that you would have wise counsel,
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.400]   see the relationship succeed, Proverbs 24, verse six says,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.980]   "By wise guidance, you can wage war,
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.240]   "and in abundance of counselors, there is victory."
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.080]   Other Proverbs say that plans fail because lack of counsel.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.420]   Counselor call out, that they would say
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.000]   if they thought the relationship was not healthy,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.660]   what so many people who got married and ended up divorced
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:24.960]   didn't have people to say.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.580]   Most people that are in a toxic relationship,
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.700]   if they're around anybody who's not toxic,
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.540]   they can go, "That's pretty toxic.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.260]   "You guys are really unhealthy and codependent and messed up.
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.260]   "And we need people in our life
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:40.940]   "that are willing to speak the truth and love
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.300]   "because they love us."
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.120]   In Hebrews chapter three, verse 14, or 12 through 13,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.760]   it says, "See to it that none of you
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.040]   "has a sinful, unbelieving heart
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.160]   "that turns away from the living God,
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.920]   "but encourage or call out one another daily,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.600]   "as long as it is called today,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.320]   "so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.440]   They're willing to speak in and give counsel.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.520]   They're also willing to come along and celebrate.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.400]   This is a good thing.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.240]   Song of Solomon, chapter one, verse four,
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.440]   and throughout the book, talks about this couple
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.000]   that had friends that looked on and they said,
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.220]   "We celebrate this relationship."
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.060]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.080]   "You guys should date and be in relationship together.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.800]   "Do you have believers in your life
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.840]   "who are coming alongside of you
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.080]   "that can speak the truth,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.020]   "that will give you their honest thoughts,
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.340]   "that will counsel you?
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:30.280]   "Because if not, you are going into deciding
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.420]   "one of the most important things in your life all alone."
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.300]   Proverbs 18, verse one says,
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.180]   "Whoever isolates himself," or lives in isolation,
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.860]   dates in isolation, "seeks his own desires.
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:49.860]   "He breaks out against all sound judgment."
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.540]   He fights against all sound judgment.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:58.860]   "He excuses and rationalized, dismisses red flags."
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.000]   That's what that means.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.940]   He tries to make excuses for, she makes excuses for,
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.220]   tries to overlook it.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.380]   Because we're in love and people in their life
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.580]   that could have been a source of protection
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.180]   at a time when that relationship ending is still painful,
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.100]   but it is far less painful than we got a two-year-old
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.620]   and you got to move out into an apartment.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.380]   And I love you and I have seen it too many times
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.980]   and I have nothing but a vested interest
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.860]   in you having an amazing marriage.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.820]   But do you have a support system?
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.940]   Do you have your people that are coming around you
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.140]   and calling you out and speaking to you?
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.780]   This was huge even in my own dating relationship
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.580]   with my wife where we were dating
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.500]   and there's just times where we got engaged
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.420]   and I remember having the most crippling anxiety
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.340]   where I was like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.420]   "did I just make the biggest mistake of my life?"
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:54.900]   And at the time you're like engaged
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.100]   and I didn't have any of those emotions
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.040]   and then there was something about that engagement
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.940]   that I don't even know what happened.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.180]   Maybe it's just what happens with cold feet
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.380]   or you just begin to like overplay
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.300]   and overplay and overplay and then you listen
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.460]   to people who give dumb advice like,
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.300]   "When you know, you know."
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.680]   And you're like, "Oh no, I thought I knew.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.520]   "Now I don't know.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.340]   "Maybe I don't know.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.180]   "Oh no."
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.440]   And I had community come around and be like,
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.740]   "Hey, what are the reasons that you feel nervous
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.260]   "or you're worried about or you're concerned about?"
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.600]   And walk through 'em and I'd be like,
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.560]   "Man, I just, I don't know.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.580]   "Maybe there could be somebody better out there for me."
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.120]   And they're like, "Yeah, there's eight billion people.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.920]   "Chances are, possibly, that's not a good biblical reason
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.820]   "why this wouldn't be a marriage that would work."
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.500]   And I walked through and they were like,
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.100]   "Yeah, none of those are good reasons."
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.780]   And they began to just kind of put my feet back on earth
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.780]   and go, "We think this is a good idea, a good relationship.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.200]   "And you're just getting cold feet and nerves.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.300]   "It's what happens."
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.300]   And they were right.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.220]   Do you have people that can speak in like that
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.440]   or they can say, "Hey, you guys,
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.480]   "you guys are moving in together
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.340]   "and you know God says that's not gonna lead
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.160]   "to a place of a healthy relationship."
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.580]   Do you have the right people?
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.240]   Finally, check your plans.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   You check your preferences, check your preparation,
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:16.480]   check your pattern or priorities, and then check your plan.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.860]   Is marriage on the horizon?
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.880]   In other words, how do I know if I'm ready to date?
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.720]   Am I dateable?
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.800]   The purpose of dating is to lead towards marriage.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.920]   And so is marriage on the horizon?
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.760]   Here's what I mean by that.
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.680]   To be abundantly clear for everybody in the room
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.920]   who's like, "Yes, yes."
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.320]   Or the people who are like, "Nuh-uh, uh-uh."
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:44.840]   Could you see yourself getting married in the near future?
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.440]   And by near future, in my opinion,
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.800]   I would say a year to a year and a half, maybe two years.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.180]   You were not made to be in a perpetual relationship
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.320]   with someone of the opposite sex that you're attracted to,
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.920]   which hopefully would be the person you're dating
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.200]   forever and ever and ever.
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.440]   Jesus in Luke 12 said this about,
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.680]   "Don't start something you can't finish."
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.500]   In Luke 12, he said,
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.680]   "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.760]   "Won't you first sit down and estimate the cost
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.160]   "to see if you have enough money to complete it?
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.180]   "For if you lay the foundation,
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.060]   "you're not able to finish it.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.700]   "Everyone who sees you will ridicule you,
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:19.200]   "saying, 'This person began to build
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.040]   "'and he wasn't able to finish.'
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.280]   "Is marriage something that you can see in the near horizon,
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.360]   "that you could actually say,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.640]   "'Man, I could see myself getting married.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.680]   "'I'm not saying you're going to.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.020]   "'I'm not saying you need to tell them that.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.240]   "'I'm just saying if marriage is off the table,
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.840]   "'dating should be off the table.'"
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.040]   And that may frustrate you, but if you can't stand the heat,
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.800]   get out of the kitchen, because it is in the dating process
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.780]   that we are walking on a path that every time
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.160]   or every relationship should be one, this is for Christians,
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.520]   where that dating is a path that leads to a promise.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.160]   That's at an altar, you're in a tux,
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.600]   she's in a white dress, preacher man right there.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.480]   That leads to a lifelong pursuit.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.080]   Dating is a path to lead to a promise,
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.260]   to lead to a lifelong pursuit, that's called marriage.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.240]   It is not to be this perpetual, and we're just dating.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.000]   I talk to some couples, and it's like,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.240]   "We've been dating five years."
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.600]   Five years?
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.360]   What information are you lacking?
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.840]   I just want to see what he's like at Christmas.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.920]   You've had five of them.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.560]   How much more time do you need?
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.160]   You were made, and if you date well, here's the deal.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.700]   Christian dating is not fun.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:36.160]   In other words, if it's fun, you're not doing it right,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.900]   because marriage is a way better relationship
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.480]   where you and that person are yoked together
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.600]   and love each other, and you're not playing the games,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.520]   you're not walking through having to leave at 10 o'clock
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.600]   and asking for accountability.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.240]   You're like, "We're going home, you know what I'm saying?"
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.880]   And you're able to continually be around one another,
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.980]   encourage, support.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.540]   And so if you're just perpetually dating,
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.720]   you're either not dating like God says,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.100]   or there's something wrong there
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.440]   that you should open and invite other people in.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.680]   Man, I don't know what it is,
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.560]   but I'm just not ready to move forward.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.840]   And you should be honest enough with yourself
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.160]   and with the person who you're dating to say,
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.280]   "Hey, I'm not ready to move forward,
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.400]   "and I don't think we should date."
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.860]   And so is marriage on the horizon?
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.220]   Is it something you're realistically like,
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.700]   "Yes, I could see myself in the future,
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   "not five years, in the near future, getting married."
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.220]   'Cause it's a path to a promise, a lifelong pursuit.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.420]   It's a little bit like this.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.780]   I hate going to the mall, hate it.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.380]   It's like, if you ever see me at the mall,
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.700]   I'm probably in a bad mood because I'm at the mall.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.580]   And so when I go to the mall, which is very rare,
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.700]   because I have mastered the art of online shopping.
[00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.820]   I buy everything online, it's amazing.
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.380]   It's incredible living in 2021.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.380]   And when I go to the mall, though, I don't know what it is.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.940]   It's just like, I walk in,
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.780]   I don't know where anything is, the stores,
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.580]   I can't breathe, the oxygen, there's so much perfume.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.820]   There's pretzels everywhere for some reason.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.900]   And it just is like, oh man, how do I get out of here?
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.580]   And I go find that little map, and I find my store,
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.620]   and I run to the map, or I run from the map to the store,
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.820]   and I get there, and I begin to buy my thing,
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.060]   and then I leave.
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.820]   Then there's people, like my wife,
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.300]   well, she will just go to the mall just for fun.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.260]   It's like, she just wants to walk around,
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.420]   try things on, look at things.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   Just, I don't even know what she's doing.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.580]   (laughing)
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.260]   And this is apparently a very common thing,
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.660]   'cause I'll, you know, people on my team,
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.500]   or people that, like, it's just a relaxing thing.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.660]   I had the opposite experience.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.220]   It is what it is, neither's right, neither's wrong.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.380]   But the perspective of, hey, I'm here,
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.660]   I know what I'm here to purchase,
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.980]   I know what I'm here for, I'm going to do it,
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.340]   not wasting time, not trying things on,
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.300]   not gonna just stroll
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.540]   if I don't have any money to purchase things.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.940]   That's okay when it comes to shopping.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.900]   It's not okay when it comes to dating.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.020]   That you weren't made to just go, you know what,
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.340]   I'm gonna try this boy on, I'm gonna try this girl on,
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.740]   I'm gonna try this relationship on,
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:03.980]   I'm gonna try this relationship on.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.820]   I don't really have any interest in purchasing anything,
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.820]   I just kind of want to see how it looks in this.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:13.820]   It's not something that, as Christians, you are to do,
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.180]   because it's not loving,
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.860]   'cause it's not putting the needs of the other person
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.420]   in their heart, above your needs, and above your heart.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.300]   It's not guarding and protecting you
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.340]   for your future marriage.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.660]   And it's okay to do that if you're shopping.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.380]   It's not okay to do that when it comes to dating.
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:35.100]   Conclusion, as it relates to are you dateable,
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.900]   I wanna walk through these really quick.
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   Have you addressed or checked your preparation?
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.220]   How are you preparing for who you're gonna be?
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.460]   Do you have the right priorities?
[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.520]   Like these are really my right, these are my priorities.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.740]   Because they're the ones God says I should prioritize.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.140]   Have you addressed your patterns?
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.060]   Some of the brokenness that exists.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:10.500]   Do you have the right people, godly counselors in your life?
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.700]   If not, maybe the thing you need to do to become dateable
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.020]   is get into a community group,
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.700]   go to First Step right after this.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.700]   Join a church somewhere.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.300]   This one or a local church where you have people
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.500]   in your life to support.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.700]   And then do you have a plan?
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:28.740]   Are you just strolling through, seeing what comes,
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.900]   or do you know, no, this is what I'm looking for,
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.100]   and I'm not going to the mall until I wanna purchase it.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.340]   I'm not going to date until I'm ready for it.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.620]   And if you do, and I know a lot of you do,
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.780]   congratulations, you are dateable.
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.120]   We'd like you to all stand up.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.920]   We're gonna do a mixer up in the loft
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.740]   and try to get as many of you paired up as possible.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.720]   And I mean it, not the mix part.
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.200]   I mean the dating part.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.120]   You should date.
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.340]   There are godly men and godly women all over this place.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.180]   You should date.
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:07.820]   And walk down that path towards the promise
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.100]   of a lifelong pursuit,
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.380]   whether or not it's with that person or not,
[00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.660]   but you are dateable.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:13.580]   And I would highly encourage you.
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.120]   Find a godly girl, or if it's a godly guy, say yes.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.120]   Others of you, you're not.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.300]   And I say that because I love you.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.780]   The best thing you can do is decide,
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.740]   I'm gonna actually take these things to heart.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.280]   I'm gonna follow what God's word says.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.320]   I'm gonna prioritize my character.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.860]   I'm gonna prioritize working on me.
[00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:30.700]   I'm gonna walk in community with other people.
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.960]   I'm gonna deal with the dysfunction
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.380]   that keeps tripping me up.
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:37.160]   And I'm gonna give the best gift that I can give
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.000]   to my spouse as I work on me.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:44.720]   That surgeon, like I said, she brought all that up.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.160]   She was like, man, if you don't,
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.040]   you could literally die.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:55.320]   Which sounded so extreme when I was talking about food.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.940]   If I ate breakfast, she said, we will not do the surgery.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.400]   And we need you to be totally honest.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.180]   Did you eat anything?
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:03.360]   Because we won't do the surgery.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.720]   Because if we did it, you could lose your life
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.040]   because of essentially choking while you're on anesthesia.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:19.060]   In a similar way, following that checklist was crucial.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.940]   Following God's checklist as it relates to love,
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.640]   romance, marriage, valuating is crucial.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.600]   Not from a physical pain and death,
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   but from a spiritual, emotional, relational death and pain.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.780]   And the decision is yours.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.780]   Are you gonna decide?
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.220]   And I could not be more passionate
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.900]   as I finish and wrap up here.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:47.100]   I wanna see God unleash godly men and women
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.140]   who know eternity is real.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:50.980]   This life is not about love.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.620]   This life is not about this life.
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:54.000]   This life is not about you.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.500]   This life is about Jesus.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.580]   And they come together with other godly men
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.580]   or other godly women, and they get married,
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.420]   and they have babies, and they have disciples
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.780]   that they raise in their home
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:06.200]   because they know heaven is real, eternity is real.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.120]   How I live in this life matters.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.020]   How you live in this life matters.
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.420]   Who you date will determine who you marry,
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.540]   which will determine the rest of your life,
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.820]   or as long as that relationship is around.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.420]   And you have to decide.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:19.740]   Am I gonna do it my own way?
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.580]   Am I gonna go, this guy doesn't know,
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.380]   he doesn't even live in the real world.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.660]   Or are you gonna say, I'm actually gonna do what God says
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.420]   when it comes to the single most important relationship
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.780]   you'll ever have?
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.700]   And if you think, ah, I'm gonna do it my way,
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.140]   you are arrogant, you are a fool,
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.040]   and no one should date you.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.900]   And then the godly ones in here are, I hope, I mean it,
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.340]   I hope you get married,
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.140]   and I hope you have an amazing marriage.
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.860]   And you raise disciples in your home,
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.700]   and you push back darkness that is all over the world.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:52.900]   And you represent what family is and marriage is,
[00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.920]   which is a reflection of God.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:58.320]   It's all about God.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.460]   Like life is all about God.
[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.540]   And you get to decide today.
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.780]   Am I gonna follow what God says, or am I not?
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:10.140]   And I can't make that decision for you, but you can.
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.320]   And it is one of the most important decisions
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.100]   you will ever make.
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.720]   So make it wisely.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.540]   Let me pray.
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:24.940]   Father, I do pray with all sincerity
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:30.420]   that there would be couples that form through this series,
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.600]   in this room, and they walk deeply with you.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.820]   They represent a faith that models to a world around them.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.760]   Though none go with us, we will follow Jesus.
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:50.920]   And we're gonna raise our children and point them to Jesus.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.880]   We're gonna live life, conduct our marriage,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:00.260]   and perfectly point them to Jesus,
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.620]   that they understand that life is not about love
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.620]   and all the different messed up messages that were sold
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.180]   from the very time that we're little boys and girls,
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:11.920]   fairy tales, that they put those ways of childhood
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.580]   behind them and they walk with Jesus,
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.520]   the one that they were made for, by,
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.820]   and the relationship that matters more
[00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.900]   than anything else in their life.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.620]   And I pray that you would end every relationship
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.260]   right now in this room that is gonna lead to pain
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:33.340]   and heartache, divorce, heartbreak,
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.740]   and that you would protect them,
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:40.140]   and that they would experience healing
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.260]   and in the midst of any pain,
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.380]   that you would be bigger than the pain.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:49.260]   And I just pray protection over all the dating relationships
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.420]   that are here, that are honoring you,
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:54.420]   that you would allow them to continue to.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.300]   We love you.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.420]   Thank you that you first loved us.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:01.500]   And in walking with you, we learn how to love.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.580]   Christ's name, amen.
