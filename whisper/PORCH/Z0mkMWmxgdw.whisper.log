[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:13.440]   - Portia, we do it, come on baby.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.560]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.560]   Come on baby.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.720]   If you're a guest with us, we're so glad you're here.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.600]   If you're tuning in from somewhere around the world,
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.440]   we love you guys.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.360]   Houston, Fort Worth, Tulsa, El Paso, we love you guys.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.460]   So glad, great to be here with you Dallas.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.860]   Uh, man, when I was five years old,
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.520]   something rather traumatic happened to me.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.220]   I went to the Houston Livestock Show.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.960]   Anybody ever been to the Houston Livestock Show?
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.720]   Shout out Houston.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.460]   Houston Livestock Show, that wasn't a traumatic event
[00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.700]   though, it happened there.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.100]   I'm with my family, I'm five years old,
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.000]   and I'm walking around, there's like at least,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.820]   you know, a billion people there.
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.500]   And we're walking through, there's a fair there,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.900]   you know, like amazing lights and carnival and all that.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.260]   And they've got like a stock show and a rodeo
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.780]   and all kinds of fun stuff.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.980]   And I'm walking through this place and I see this ride,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.780]   the zipper, anybody ever read the zippers?
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.420]   Got the, and I'm looking at the lights,
[00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.580]   and I'm like, wow, that looks amazing.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.940]   And I'm like a moth to a flame looking at it,
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.400]   but that's not what was traumatic.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.580]   This is what was traumatic.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.140]   Then, as I'm looking at that, I look up,
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.660]   and I don't see my parents anywhere.
[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.760]   No brothers and sisters, no mom and dad.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.800]   I'm just there in the middle of all the people,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.660]   lost as an Easter egg, you know, I'm just like,
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.180]   mom and dad, mom and dad.
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.380]   And I'm walking around, and when you're five years old
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.620]   and you're at the Houston Livestock Show
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.520]   and you can't see your family,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.020]   you start, what goes through your mind is crazy things,
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.340]   like I wonder what orphanage they're gonna put me in.
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.980]   And, you know, I just like, I assume I'll never see 'em
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.260]   again, there's just no way they're gonna find me.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.380]   I don't have a cell phone, I'm five.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.380]   And I'm just, all of this panic comes into my heart
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.660]   and my mind and my body, and then I look up,
[00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.160]   and I remember my dad saying, if you ever get lost,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.780]   find a police officer.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.320]   Then I look up and I see this group of men
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.940]   in blue uniforms with those kind of, you know,
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.600]   octagonal hats and a badge.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.660]   And so I walk up to them and they see me,
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.020]   kind of from afar, and they say, you know,
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.860]   are you lost?
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.080]   And I kind of shake my head yes,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.700]   and they get me eventually, punchline,
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.500]   they get me back to my family.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140]   I didn't stay lost, praise God.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.760]   And so they get me where I need to be,
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.140]   but why I start there is because of what my dad told me.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.700]   Hey, you need to find someone with a badge,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.860]   that they're in this uniform.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.380]   They look a particular way.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.380]   Anytime you're somewhere and you need help, you find them.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.300]   And in the same way, Jesus says something
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.180]   about his followers, something that's gonna mark them,
[00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.440]   like a uniform they put on.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.660]   It's the way they love.
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.300]   Now if you've been in church long,
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.980]   like none of your minds were just blown.
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.720]   You're like, oh yeah, he says that John 13,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.680]   that you'll know, they'll know you're my disciples
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.520]   by the way you love.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.420]   You're just like, oh yeah, right?
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.500]   And you probably all just thought, like yeah, love,
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.340]   I'm pretty good at love.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.620]   My God, I'm wearing my love uniform right now,
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.740]   I got my love badge, me and love, we're good.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.860]   And we love love.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.820]   We love love.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.500]   Anybody watch the royal wedding?
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.300]   Good.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.820]   Good.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.100]   Praise God, because who does that?
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.180]   Like you don't have anything else to do at 6 a.m.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.820]   I wouldn't even go to my own wedding if it was at 6 a.m.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.900]   Why would you do that?
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.300]   But 29.2 million Americans did.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.500]   Okay, that's right, and two people here.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.140]   And so 29.2 million Americans,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.360]   and all the buzz was this sermon.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.460]   This sermon Bishop Curry gave, all about love.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.460]   He said the word love 58 times in 13 minutes.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.580]   That's four and a half times per minute, roughly.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.580]   Somebody's gonna find me afterwards,
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.500]   like actually, it's 4.46.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.380]   Anyways, so he said love a whole lot.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.340]   And I think everybody's fired up, the whole world's like,
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.680]   man, that message was amazing.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.860]   And we have no idea how to do it.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.380]   He started and ended with a quote from Martin Luther King.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.100]   "We must discover the power of love,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.620]   "the power, the redemptive power of love.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.220]   "And when we discover that,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.500]   "we will be able to make of this old world a new world.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.600]   "We will be able to make men better.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.340]   "Love is the only way."
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.880]   And that's an amazing quote, and I agree with it.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.340]   I think it's incredible, but we have no idea how.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.080]   Maybe you went to Justin Timberlake concert, okay?
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.420]   You don't have to, you know, you can hide in the crowd,
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.260]   it's fine.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.980]   But you might have seen David Marvin there.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.740]   And in between F-bombs, he's calling people to love.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.220]   Hey, I'm preaching up here, if you don't mind.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.060]   Keep it quiet.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.060]   And so in between F-bombs, he's telling everyone
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.780]   that they need to love, right?
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.780]   And everybody, that's the message right now.
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.900]   Love, love, love, love, love.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.160]   And here's the problem.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.940]   I think we've diluted that word so much.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.580]   You have no idea how to apply it to your life.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.340]   And so that's what I hope to do
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.780]   over just the next few minutes together,
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.540]   is to give you a vision of what could happen to the world,
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.980]   and specifically what could happen to your life
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.060]   if you really get this.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.500]   And guys, I gotta tell you up front,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.740]   I don't think this is something we miss a little bit.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.940]   Like, I don't think we're just like,
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.420]   we're throwing a dart at the bullseye
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.740]   and we're just off a little bit.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.020]   I think we're facing the wrong way,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.020]   throwing the wrong direction at the wrong board.
[00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.140]   This is something we've gotta course correct majorly on,
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.340]   because I think it's something we're all good at
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.980]   when we're not good at it.
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.580]   We're like Uncle Rico talking about football,
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.700]   you know, like the glory days and how good we are.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.420]   And it's like somebody, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.380]   And so we just, we love to talk about it.
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.540]   We love to talk about love.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.300]   But the people who are really loving,
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.020]   they're not talking about it, they're just doing it.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.300]   And you know those people.
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   You know those people, right?
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.780]   You meet 'em and they never forget your name.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.580]   You see 'em, they remember your name,
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.900]   and you're like, man, I'm just really bad at names.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.500]   No, you're really bad at love.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.340]   You know, and they never forget a birthday,
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.420]   and not because Facebook reminded them,
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.020]   they just know, like, oh man,
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.220]   in your birthday in September, and you just had one.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.860]   And when they get you a gift, it's not what they wanted,
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.820]   but it's what you really wanted.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.900]   They give the best gifts.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.260]   You guys know someone like that?
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.740]   Just someone, they show up at the right time,
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.500]   and they know when to step back,
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.300]   and they know when to lean in,
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.740]   even if you're kind of projecting
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.060]   that you don't want them to.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.820]   You know someone like that?
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.420]   You know someone who loves like that?
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.860]   Why don't you love like that?
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:27.300]   What's the difference between them and you?
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.100]   For us, we're just trying to get ours, right?
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.860]   Trying to get our close parking space,
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.940]   make sure we live our lives,
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.380]   get our money, get our things.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.020]   And so we're in this series called The Remnant.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.980]   Let me just be abundantly clear what that means.
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.380]   The Remnant is simply God's people.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.940]   That God, in the history of history,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.380]   has always had some people to himself.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.020]   Right now, on this earth,
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.420]   God has a people chosen by God and for God.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.300]   If you're here, and you're gonna be in heaven one day,
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.300]   for certain, you're a part of the Remnant.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.500]   If you're here, and you don't know
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.780]   if you're gonna be in heaven one day,
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.260]   I hope to change that.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.340]   I hope the Holy Spirit changes that in the next 30 minutes.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.700]   And so today, tonight, I wanna talk about
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.580]   how the Remnant are marked by love,
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.940]   that this is the badge that we wear,
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.260]   and honestly, we're the only ones who wear it.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.820]   The Remnant are the only ones who can love.
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.100]   So now I just redefined love in your mind,
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.940]   'cause I'm not talking about all the love
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.620]   that the world is bringing about,
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.540]   saying, hey, you need to do, no, the people of God
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.740]   are the only ones who can love like this.
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.820]   And I remember when I learned this.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.900]   I mean, it changed my life.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.420]   It rocked my world.
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.140]   I can remember reading through the Scriptures,
[00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.700]   thinking, man, if I'm supposed to love like this,
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.220]   I've gotta change some major things.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.300]   Monica and I sat down at the table,
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.180]   and I remember thinking, hey, we've got some empty bedrooms,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.580]   and there's people who need a place to stay,
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.260]   and four guys ended up moving in with us.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.020]   Then I can remember I had a motorcycle in the garage
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.540]   that I hardly ever drove, and I'm like,
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.460]   but there's, and there's people that need money,
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.260]   and I remember selling that motorcycle
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.020]   and walking around with the money in my pocket
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.260]   and giving it to missions.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.700]   But if I'm totally honest with you,
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.420]   before you start to think that, wow, that's amazing,
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.900]   how I'm, this season, I look back on that season,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.780]   and there's a gap between,
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.700]   because what happens is the current of selfishness
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.140]   swept me up, and I have to look back into the Scriptures,
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.980]   and tonight, preach out of my own conviction,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.860]   meaning it convicted me to look back in the Scriptures
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.260]   and audit my life and say, okay, now,
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.260]   what changes do I need to make yet again?
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.460]   Because the Scriptures calling us to something crazy
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.420]   that's not crazy for the remnant.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.400]   It's just normal.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.860]   It's just normal, and selfishness is the enemy
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.900]   of this love.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.240]   Nothing you do out of selfishness can ever be loving.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.680]   And so if Christians or the remnant are marked by love,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.240]   how did you do this week?
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:13.180]   Did you love everyone you walked by that you saw in need?
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.740]   Or how many people did you send a voicemail?
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.940]   Or how many people were you too busy for?
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.940]   How many times did you try to get the closest parking place?
[00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.380]   Being marked by love has always been
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.020]   an integral part of Christianity,
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.220]   and specifically those who follow Christ.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.340]   If it's not loving, if somebody says,
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.660]   that's Christianity, it's not loving,
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.760]   they've either misunderstood Christianity
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.300]   or they've misunderstood what is loving.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.460]   And so if we dive in tonight,
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.360]   there's gonna be a lot of Scriptures
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.920]   over the next few minutes, lots of Scriptures.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.980]   Honestly, the Bible talks a lot about this.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.700]   I'll teach topically, and I'm gonna cover what love is,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.620]   what love does, and before you leave here this evening,
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.980]   how we love.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.060]   And so let's just dive in what love is.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.180]   What love is, there's an entire chapter dedicated to this.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.620]   It says love is, love is, love is, love is.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.160]   But here's the problem with love.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.060]   The problem with that word is we love everything.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.420]   We love chocolate, and we love our favorite sports team,
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.820]   and we love football, and we love our boyfriend,
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.740]   and we love our girlfriend, and we love mama and apple pie.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.700]   We love all of these different things.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.500]   In the Bible, it has several words in the Greek for love.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.380]   We have one word that describes every kind of thing
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.180]   that could possibly be love, but it says this.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.060]   I wanna define what we're talking about.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.900]   It's this right here.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.720]   Here's a picture of it.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.420]   It's 1 Corinthians 13, verses four through seven.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.700]   Love is patient.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.980]   Love is kind.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.940]   Love does not envy.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.140]   It does not boast.
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.700]   It is not proud.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.300]   Love does not dishonor others.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.000]   It is not self-seeking.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.860]   Love is not easily angered.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.660]   Love keeps no records of wrongs.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.580]   Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.820]   It always protects.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.780]   It always trusts.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.860]   It always hopes.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.700]   It always perseveres.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.080]   This is what we're talking about.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.460]   When I say the word love,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.500]   this is what you need to think about.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.620]   This is a picture of what biblical love is,
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.220]   and if it's not that, then it's not love.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.100]   Now, we often think about love in context of relationships,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.560]   someone that you have given your heart to,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.020]   someone that you wake up thinking about,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.260]   that kind of love, right?
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.620]   That's what Bishop Curry was talking about
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.720]   so much of his sermon,
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.740]   and I think we even misunderstand it in that context.
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.860]   I was talking to a guy recently.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.660]   He came up, and he just wanted some relationship advice.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.300]   I love my girlfriend so much.
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.840]   I'm so in love with her.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.420]   I love her so much, and we've started sleeping together,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.460]   and I've really been struggling
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.420]   with just these weird thoughts of jealousy.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.100]   I begin to think about her and my best friend,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.340]   and it's driving me crazy.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.300]   As I'm driving down the road,
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.740]   I have these jealous thoughts kind of interrupting my mind,
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.940]   and I don't know what to do, and it's driving me crazy.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.780]   I just said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.600]   "Hold on, honey.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.440]   "Let me just say something.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.700]   "Hey, you don't love her."
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.140]   What?
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.560]   No, no, no, let's just redefine that word you're using.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.500]   You don't love her.
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.560]   Then there's nothing that you just said
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.420]   that's consistent with how the Bible defines love,
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.060]   and this is a really clear checklist.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.340]   Like if it's not this, it ain't love.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.560]   So you might be infatuated with her.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.620]   You may have really passionate feelings toward her.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.660]   Like you may think about her all the time.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.100]   You may be completely and totally,
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.460]   utterly codependent upon her,
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.500]   but what you have for her is not love,
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.860]   and you just, you gotta come to that reality.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.660]   You gotta, you gotta grip that,
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.220]   because like right here, it's a checklist.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.340]   In fact, when I speak to a roomful of men,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.260]   I'll often give them this checklist
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.740]   right here in 1 Corinthians 13 and say,
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.660]   "Hey, if you can't do this,
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.140]   "then you are in no place to love.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.460]   "You have no idea how to love."
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.000]   And I just, I spend a lot of my time
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.840]   with thousands, honestly, of young adult men,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.800]   and I've just learned that all of the things,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.940]   like we've learned calculus,
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.300]   and we've learned all of these amazing things in college.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.420]   We never learned how to love.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.300]   We just have no idea how,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.860]   and it's this really clear checklist.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.860]   I've actually turned it into five Cs.
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.780]   If you've heard that message, we did.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.200]   And so in the same way that you tell
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.500]   if a diamond is genuine, or you tell what it's worth,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.760]   you look at the four Cs, color, cut, clarity, and caret,
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.180]   in the same way, if you wanna know
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.060]   if someone's love is real, you look at,
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.100]   you say, does it cherish?
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.260]   Here, you can write these down if you want.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.420]   It's five questions.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.020]   Does this love cherish the other?
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.280]   Is this love confident?
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.460]   Is this love controlled?
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.280]   Does this love allow for a clear conscience?
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.680]   And is this love committed?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.100]   Because if it's not those things,
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.420]   I would write it off as something counterfeit.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.700]   It's not genuine, it's not love.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.660]   What love is, I'm gonna give you the definition now.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.160]   Love is giving of yourself for the benefit of others
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.960]   at a perceived cost to you.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.820]   Love is giving of yourself for the benefit of others
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.060]   at a perceived cost to you,
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.100]   often a huge cost to you.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.740]   Maybe a huge perceived sacrifice.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.620]   Now, why I say that word perceived right there
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.340]   is because the scripture tells us
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.860]   that anything that we do with the right heart,
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.500]   that we're receiving more than what we gave.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.500]   That Jesus came back from the grave,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.900]   he's defeated death, and if we do something
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.540]   with the right heart, we receive,
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.620]   he even says, 100 times as much
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.560]   in this world and the world to come.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.100]   Let me give you an example.
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.240]   This past week was my daughter's
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.160]   end of the season soccer party,
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   and so she plays soccer, and so we went to Altitude
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.040]   and had a party there, it's a trampoline park,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.940]   and it was a good time.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.820]   And so at the end, we're kind of wrapping up the time,
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.360]   and she says, Daddy, that's not how she talks.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.720]   She said, Daddy, can I get an Icy?
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.760]   Can I get an Icy?
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.560]   And I'm like, hey, we're about to eat,
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.060]   I don't know, Icy.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.120]   And she's like, no, Icy.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.160]   And she kind of pouted, she didn't throw a fit,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.500]   but she was just bummed that I said
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.340]   she couldn't have an Icy.
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.860]   I'm like, I don't wanna spend $5 on a frozen Coke,
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:20.860]   you know, and so, no.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.620]   And as she's pouting, I'm thinking,
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.580]   okay, what can I do to teach something?
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.420]   I said, all right, come here, hey, listen.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.380]   You wanna have some fun?
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.860]   Let's have some fun, okay?
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.180]   I'm gonna give you something better than an Icy.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.340]   Here's what you can do.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.660]   You can go throughout the trampoline park
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.940]   and you can offer everybody else an Icy.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.940]   There's about 100, 150 kids there.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.820]   I'm kind of thinking, all right,
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.420]   this may set me back $500, but if,
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.920]   if she learns the lesson that it's better to give
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.100]   than to receive, it's all worth it.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.300]   And she's like, what do you mean?
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.540]   I'm like, you can go and offer everybody else an Icy.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.380]   Everybody, you can just tell them to get in line
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.620]   and they will get an Icy, and you and I will pay for it.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.300]   I'll pay for it and you can say you paid for it.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.860]   And, and she's like, well, can I offer Ellie an Icy?
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.260]   I'm like, yes, everyone in here.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.580]   She's like, can I offer more than one person an Icy?
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:16.660]   I'm like, you don't understand what I'm saying.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.700]   Everybody in the trampoline park gets an Icy.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.180]   You can offer them one.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.060]   And she's like, are you serious?
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.220]   I'm like, yeah, I'm serious.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.500]   And once she kind of got over her fear of man
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.020]   and being bummed that she wasn't getting one,
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.260]   she had a blast.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.940]   Hey, do you want an Icy?
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.820]   Hey, come here, you want an Icy?
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.460]   Hey, my daddy, he'll buy you an Icy.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.780]   You just gotta get in line.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.620]   You want an Icy?
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.460]   You know, you can have Blue Raspberry,
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.580]   you can have Coke, you can have Cherry,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.300]   whatever you want, Icy, just get in line.
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.840]   And we had so much fun.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.940]   And afterwards, I just said, hey, was that better
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.140]   than you getting an Icy?
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.900]   And she, you know, she hesitated for a minute.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.180]   She's like, well, I really wanna one.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.060]   But, then she was like, yeah, I guess it was.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.340]   That was pretty fun, right?
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.620]   That was a blast.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.020]   That's what this love does.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.900]   That's what this love does, is it gives of itself
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.820]   as a sacrifice, at a cost.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.100]   It thinks outside the box.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.820]   The world is your playground, man.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.560]   Live the adventure.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.060]   Look around and do something stupid
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.020]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.260]   Like, just think, okay, what?
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.240]   Like, the world is always gonna call
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.700]   this kind of love crazy.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.140]   That's why the remnant's the only one that can do this.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.260]   The remnant's the only one that can love this way.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.300]   It doesn't make any logical sense
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.500]   to someone without the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.140]   So, let's talk about what love does.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.180]   What love does, love sacrifices itself to serve others.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.900]   Listen, this love I'm talking about,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.580]   it shows no partiality.
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.100]   The reason we don't know how to love,
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.380]   because somewhere in our subconscious,
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.340]   as our old self still lives on,
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.540]   they're not fully put to death by the Holy Spirit,
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.060]   we're still gripping for those old parts of our heart,
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.860]   really everything we do is to receive.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.860]   Even the way you give in a relationship,
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.220]   it's to make you feel good,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.740]   or you give to someone, you think,
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.940]   oh, that makes me feel good.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.920]   That's why, so there's something selfish about that.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.320]   This love has no ounce of selfishness in it.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.860]   So, if you're dating someone, right,
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.220]   don't look at how he loves you or how she loves you.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.820]   Look at how he or she loves their enemies.
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.900]   That's gonna give you a picture of their heart,
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.780]   even if the Holy Spirit has them.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.460]   Because this love that shows no partiality,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.500]   it stretches even as far as our enemies.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.940]   Jesus says in Matthew chapter five, verse 44,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.060]   love your enemies.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.660]   As you live this life,
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.700]   or you live this adventure of giving your life away.
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.540]   I think that,
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:55.580]   I think when you think about Christianity,
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.500]   for a lot of you, as I look out there,
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.660]   I think you think about all the rules, all the don'ts.
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.260]   Don't have sex before you're married,
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.420]   don't kill anybody, don't steal,
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.900]   don't want something that's not yours.
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.780]   Right, and we're playing defense.
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.700]   We're constantly like, okay, how do I not sin?
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.820]   That's, we're playing this game
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.380]   where we're trying to not sin.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.120]   You know how you not sin, you love?
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   You cannot love a biblical love and sin at the same time.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.460]   Have you ever heard like the best defense is a good offense?
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.820]   You know what I mean, the best defense,
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.260]   like if you have LeBron on your team,
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.500]   the best defense is gonna give,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.380]   to be to give him the ball and let him make buckets.
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.300]   Right, and just put up numbers.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.580]   Because the other team won't be able to catch up.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.800]   The best defense is a good offense.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.020]   The best don't kill, don't steal,
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.160]   don't have sex out of marriage,
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.100]   is to truly learn how to love.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.300]   And if you truly learn how to love,
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.240]   you won't do those things, you're like,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.820]   JP, man, that's interesting.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.820]   Is that really in the Bible?
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.620]   It sure is, Romans 13.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.100]   Okay, let no debt remain outstanding
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.180]   except the continuing debt to love one another
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.480]   for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.260]   The commandments, you shall not commit adultery,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.500]   sex outside of marriage, you shall not murder, kill,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.780]   you shall not steal, you shall not covet,
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.140]   wanting things that aren't yours.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.820]   And whatever other command there are,
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.060]   or there may be, are summed up in this one command,
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.100]   love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.480]   Love does no harm to a neighbor,
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.320]   therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.640]   What does it mean that love is the fulfillment of the law?
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   If you love, you'll obey the other 613 commandments.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   Jesus takes 613 laws, and he says,
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.120]   all you need to do are these two things,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.400]   love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.240]   soul, mind, and strength,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.420]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.560]   If you don't do those two things,
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.920]   you will do the other 613, it will just happen.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.380]   Play offense, play offense well,
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.020]   and you don't have to worry about defense.
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.580]   I'm sure you've heard it said that
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.840]   people don't care how much you know
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.540]   until they know how much you care.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.220]   People don't care how much you've learned
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.780]   until they know you've learned to love.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.440]   But again, we gotta redefine that word.
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.140]   It's a self-sacrifice.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.580]   It's giving of yourself for the benefit of someone else
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.760]   at a cost to you.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:36.060]   I wanna tell you about a young man named Ryan.
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:41.280]   Ryan and his family moved to Highland Park, Park Cities,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.940]   and they moved next door to a family that went to Watermark.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.520]   And this family that went to Watermark
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.040]   was loving on Ryan and his family.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.520]   And one day we had baptism service at Curtis Park
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.760]   in the Park Cities here in Dallas.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.600]   And so Ryan's parents walked by
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.800]   as we had this baptism celebration.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.400]   There's bounce houses, it's a party, there's snow cones,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.200]   and people are getting dumped in the pond there.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.360]   Ryan's mom was like, "Guys, that's so weird."
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.200]   Goes to that Watermark family,
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.360]   "It's so weird, what's wrong with you?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.520]   "You guys are a cult.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.640]   "Why are you throwing a carnival in the park
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.760]   "and putting people underwater?
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.580]   "That's just weird, stop that.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.120]   "And you're taking up all the parking spaces.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.400]   "Would you stop?"
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   And there was a young man, a young adult,
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   like one of you, his name is Nixon,
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.880]   and Nixon was starting a Bible study
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.600]   in Ryan's neighborhood and invited him.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.920]   Just said, "Come, you wanna hang out?"
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.180]   Just kind of invited all the guys.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.520]   And he just started loving on him,
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.400]   really just throwing the football, hanging with him.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.820]   Didn't know him that well, but knew him.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.660]   Knew a lot of the other guys better than him,
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.100]   but just said, "Hey, you can come hang out with us
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.460]   "anytime, you always have a place here."
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.600]   And didn't see him for a little while,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.540]   followed up with his parents one time,
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.660]   and just said, "Hey, I hadn't seen your son,
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.060]   "Ryan, in a while.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.840]   "What's going on?
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.020]   "Where's he been, how's he doing?
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.660]   "Is he doing okay?"
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.620]   And Ryan's parents said, "Well, no, he's not.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.100]   "He's actually had some kidney issues,
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.500]   "and he's going through dialysis right now,
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.080]   "and we're really sad for our son."
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.100]   And so Nixon said, "Well, hey, let me just come over
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.900]   "and cheer him up and hang with him.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.540]   "I'll read him some scriptures, I'll pray over him.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:23.420]   "Let me just hang with him."
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.620]   And started doing that,
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.180]   and checked back in with his parents one day,
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.140]   and just said, "Hey, how's everything going for you?"
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.380]   And they said, "Well, we're gonna do a fun run
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.200]   "to raise money for his surgery,
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.820]   "and then we're going to do a blood drive
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.780]   "to see if there's any matches,
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.740]   "so that we can find a donor, someone to give him a kidney.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.780]   "And it's really hard to find a match."
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.780]   And so Nixon just said, "Well,
[00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.440]   "hey, I'd love to help with the fun run,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.680]   "and I'd love to go see if I'm a match."
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.620]   And went to the hospital, and they drew some of his blood,
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.280]   and the nurse came ecstatically and said,
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.420]   "You're a match, as though you guys
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.620]   "would be identical twins.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.080]   "You're a closer match.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.920]   "We haven't seen this.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.000]   "You're a closer match than if he had an identical twin.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.440]   "You're a closer match than a sibling would be.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.620]   "This is crazy."
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.540]   And he said, "Well, it must be the Lord's will.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.040]   "He needs a kidney, I got two, he can have mine."
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.780]   And this guy who's just been loving on this kid
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.320]   that he barely knows, this young adult here,
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.620]   hanging around this place,
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.480]   says, "Here, you can have my kidney.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.320]   "Take it."
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.140]   I love what he said.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.040]   He said he had need.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.160]   I had what he needed.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.600]   How could I not meet his need?
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.760]   Right?
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.640]   How do I not do that?
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   Why would not do that?
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.320]   And you're thinking, well, you did have two.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.340]   You have no idea that surgery that he has to go under,
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.160]   they gotta go and cut into his back,
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.440]   pull out an organ, right?
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:01.800]   And what's crazy is Ryan's parents saw that love,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.280]   and they started hanging around this place.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.720]   They became members.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.700]   They did that crazy ceremonial baptism.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.320]   They both got baptized, became believers, got baptized.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.560]   It's amazing, right?
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.400]   Praise God.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.040]   [congregation applauding]
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.920]   Ryan's dad came on staff here,
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.080]   left his job, he owned a business,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.920]   left it and came on staff.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.760]   He said, "I just wanna be more around that place."
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.960]   Right?
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.280]   Now, we could've went to them with,
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.120]   "Hey, you wanna be a Christian?
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.200]   "Here's lots of don'ts, you know?
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.720]   "Here's the law, obey the law.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.320]   "You need to get baptized.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.520]   "You need to like, we need to take you,
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.080]   "hold you underwater, pull you back up."
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.200]   And then, you know, no, no.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.800]   Look at the love, look at the example of sacrificial love.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.620]   That's what we do.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.120]   That's what marks the remnant.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.140]   If you're sitting there and you're like,
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:51.980]   "Man, that's crazy."
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.940]   No, it's not, it's just normal.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.880]   It's completely normal.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.760]   It's just what the remnant does.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.380]   You see someone with need, and you just meet it.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.220]   And you don't think like,
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.560]   "What will I get in return from them?"
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:04.080]   It doesn't have to be someone you know really close,
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   doesn't have to be a family member,
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.300]   just someone in need.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.080]   And you just meet the need.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.400]   "Isn't that crazy?" Nope.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.880]   Uh-uh.
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.720]   It's normal.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.860]   It's really, really, really normal.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.240]   And so, love sacrifices self
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.440]   to serve others and fulfill the law.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.480]   The reason Nixon gave his kidney
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.080]   is because Nixon gives his heart everywhere he goes.
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.640]   It was just an extension of his faith in that moment.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.280]   So, love sacrifices self to serve others.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.160]   Let's talk about how we do this before we leave.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.320]   How we love.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.080]   Third point, how we love.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.120]   It's a really challenging application for you guys
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.760]   because I don't know what you need to do.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.960]   As you go back to work tomorrow,
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.600]   as you return to your neighborhood,
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.560]   as you go home tonight, I don't know what you need to do.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.880]   I know that we need to love more,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.760]   and more often, and bigger, and better.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.520]   And it might feel like boil the ocean.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.520]   It might be like, "Man, it's just so crazy."
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.720]   You need to be thinking about right now
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.120]   what you need to do, and you need to do it tomorrow,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.720]   and the next day, and the next day, and the next day.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.840]   Begin to give your life away.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.840]   Okay, begin to give your life away.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.520]   Some of you, we'll get into that in a moment,
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.640]   but let's just talk about how we love.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.680]   Galatians 5, verse 22 says this.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.800]   Now, as I read this,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.680]   think about that verse in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.960]   Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.280]   it does not boast, right?
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.920]   It is not proud, it does not dishonor others,
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.320]   it keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   Love does not delight in evil,
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.400]   but rejoices with the truth.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.640]   It always protects, always trusts,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.120]   always hopes, always perseveres.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.680]   Who can love like that?
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.560]   Listen, but the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.520]   what God's Holy Spirit in your life
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.780]   begins to produce is love.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.040]   Number one, it produces love.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.880]   But you know what else it produces?
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.520]   It produces joy, and peace, and forbearance.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.560]   Your Bible might say patience, love is patient.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.920]   It produces kindness, love is kind.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.200]   It produces goodness, love does not dishonor others.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.140]   It produces faithfulness, love always protects,
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.360]   always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres, faithfulness.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.560]   It produces gentleness and self-control.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.280]   Against these things there is no law, sounds familiar.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.840]   Those who belong to Christ Jesus
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.880]   have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.760]   1 Corinthians 13 says, love does not delight in evil.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.460]   Love is not self-seeking.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.120]   Since we live by this Spirit,
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.880]   Let us not become conceited,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.480]   because 1 Corinthians 13 says love does not boast.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.360]   Provoking and envying each other,
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.180]   because love does not envy.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:45.180]   Do you see the comparison?
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.120]   I could take 1 Corinthians 13 and set it on Galatians 5,
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.520]   and as you sit out there, and you say,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.320]   but how do I love like that?
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.420]   JP, you surrender to God's Holy Spirit in you.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.460]   And you begin to think, you can't leave here
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.640]   by the bootstraps and say, okay,
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.720]   I'm really gonna try to do this.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.600]   No, no, it's a surrendering.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.320]   God has to be at work in your life.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.540]   It's the only way to love like this,
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.100]   to begin to take the mind of God,
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.360]   to begin to see with the eyes of God,
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.320]   to begin to serve with the hands of God,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.360]   to begin to go with the feet of God,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.420]   and to begin to think and see the world as your playground,
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.920]   and you being an extension of the Creator
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.880]   of the heavens and the earth,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.840]   and say, who would you have me love?
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.640]   How would you have me love them?
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.040]   What would you have me do?
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.720]   And nothing's too crazy.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.620]   As long as it's not sin, you have at it.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.080]   You have at it.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:51.640]   So, the Holy Spirit gives us this power.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.400]   Let me give you another verse.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.440]   It's 1 John 4.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.800]   It says, dear friends, let us love one another.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.240]   Hey, in the Greek, it's this, agaperos agapeo.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.120]   It means this, those who are loved, love others.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.500]   Agaperos, those who are loved, agapeo, love others.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.900]   For love comes from God.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.680]   Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.600]   Those who love are God's children.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.740]   Whoever does not love does not know God,
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.640]   because God is love.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.920]   This is how God showed his love among us.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.680]   He sent his one and only Son into the world
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.000]   that we might live through him.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.280]   This is love.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.960]   Not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.880]   and sent his Son, Jesus, as an atoning sacrifice,
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.960]   a payment for our sins.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.400]   Dear friends, since God so loved us,
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.220]   we also ought to love one another.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.140]   No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.880]   God lives in us and has been made complete in us.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.360]   That when you begin to love,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.680]   as the Scripture calls you to love people,
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.360]   the world begins to see God and is drawn to him.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.740]   Is that not what happened with Ryan's family?
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.340]   They begin to see God and they're drawn to him.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.800]   This is God's plan.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.720]   This is how God, this is why he says,
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.240]   "They will know that you're mine, that you belong to me,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.960]   "that you're my children by the way that you love."
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.280]   It's like,
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.520]   have you ever been sunburned?
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.320]   I mean, now listen, don't just nod your head.
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.380]   I'm talking real bad.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.960]   I'm talking like you couldn't sleep.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.880]   Okay, you and me, we get it.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.600]   The rest of you, we'll talk to you afterwards
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.080]   and explain it.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.240]   And so, when I was in college,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.840]   when I was in college, I decided I was gonna lay out
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.280]   because that's a manly thing to do.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.120]   And so, I get my pool chair and I'm laying out
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.140]   and I fall asleep and just completely lose track of time.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.060]   And guys, I mean, there was like a line right here
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:53.920]   and everything this side was glowing,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.280]   like radiating.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.000]   If you would've gotten near me, I would've burned you
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.880]   'cause I was hot, it was hot.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.680]   And I mean, just like so bad, right?
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.200]   And if you saw me, you would've known
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.360]   what happened immediately.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.560]   Whoa, man, what's wrong, lobster boy?
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.640]   Like you got too much time in the sun, huh?
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.560]   Too much time in the sun.
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.300]   You would've seen that I had spent time in the sun.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.040]   And likewise, the world will see
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.760]   that you spent time with the sun, S-O-N now,
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.560]   that Jesus, God, that if you spend time with God,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.920]   so like a part of the way that you're gonna love tomorrow,
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.600]   everybody's like, oh yeah, I'm gonna go tomorrow
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.160]   and I'm really gonna love somebody.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.480]   The only way you're gonna do that
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.440]   is if you start your day tomorrow with God
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.000]   and you begin to pray, Lord, search me.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.380]   You know me, you know when I sit and when I stand.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.680]   Would you show me any anxious way in me?
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.160]   God, as I read through your scriptures,
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.280]   would you reveal your desires for my life
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.200]   through your word?
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.760]   And you start your day tomorrow with God.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.680]   It's the only way.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.240]   So then when you go to work tomorrow
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.720]   or you go somewhere tomorrow,
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.200]   people are gonna say, oh man, you spent time with the sun.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.120]   I can tell by the way that you're surrendering to a spirit
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.720]   and the way that you're loving others.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.880]   And they're gonna see that in your life.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.600]   You won't be able to do that
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.100]   without having spent time with God.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.480]   In this text here, it says the reason is
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.800]   because Jesus, our faith is founded on this truth
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.040]   of the gospel that God gave his only son,
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.520]   that whoever believes in him shall not perish
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.480]   but have eternal life, that God gave.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.800]   It was an act of love.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.720]   The greatest act of love you know
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.600]   is that a father willingly gave his child
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.580]   as a payment for your sins,
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.840]   that his son willingly gave his life,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.620]   not a gun to the head, once and done,
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.960]   a slow, torturous, public, humiliating death
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.920]   as a payment
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.940]   because you got drunk,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.200]   because you guys went too far on that date,
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.320]   because you looked at those images,
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.480]   because you're obsessed with your body,
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.440]   because you're codependent,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.320]   because you spend more than you make for these reasons.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.040]   He died.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.280]   And that's foundational to our faith, that act of love.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.920]   And so really we go through the world
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.040]   and we display the gospel in the way
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.520]   that we give of ourselves sacrificially
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:24.560]   for people who can do nothing for us in return.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.920]   And I could give you lots of examples of this.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.560]   It's not just giving away a kidney.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.960]   I think I can just, from this week,
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.840]   I think about my friend John who met the person
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.560]   who was checking him out at the grocery store
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.320]   as a Muslim man named Osama.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.720]   And he said, "Osama, do you wanna have dinner?"
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.600]   And they had dinner and he said,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.240]   "Hey, do you wanna come over and meet my family?"
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.040]   And he brought him into his living room
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.320]   and he introduced him to his wife and children
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.640]   and he's hanging out with them.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.080]   And Osama doesn't have a car,
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.680]   so he takes them back and forth from the restaurant
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.720]   to his house and then back to his apartment.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:58.600]   I think about someone who, a porch goer,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:03.120]   who opens their house to a bunch of homeless people
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.480]   at Thanksgiving.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.080]   He says, "Hey, you guys are my family.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.320]   "Y'all have Thanksgiving here."
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.920]   I think about someone who bought a minister,
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.480]   someone in ministry a car.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.240]   I think about a porch goer who bought a homeless person
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.220]   a house, are you kidding me?
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.760]   Bought them a house.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.480]   A couple here at the porch who helped a pregnant mom
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.360]   by adopting her child.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.600]   I think about someone who gives someone a ride home
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   every single Tuesday after the porch,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.320]   way out of the way in West Dallas,
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.200]   takes them home every single week.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.800]   I think about that band that's sometime out there
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.360]   at porch late night, you guys know the band?
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.480]   We don't pay for that.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.560]   Somebody says, "Hey, I love that environment so much.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.020]   "I wanna pay for that."
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.840]   I think about a porch goer who raises money
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.040]   to take 22 Burmese teenagers to camp every summer
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.400]   to the sum of about $20,000.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.980]   I think about my friends here that mentor kids
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.060]   through Mercy Street every single week.
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.000]   I think about my friends here who serve tirelessly
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.900]   at Brother Bill's.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.080]   I think about, there was a launch announcement earlier.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.720]   Do you know that there's gonna be a lot of people
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.280]   at launch who didn't pay to go there
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.760]   but that others just scholarship them?
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.100]   They said, "Hey, I want you to go.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.200]   "I'll pay for your way.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.760]   "I'm gonna buy my ticket and somebody else's ticket."
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.220]   I think about young adults who've thrown birthday parties
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.480]   for complete strangers because no one else
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.640]   was there to celebrate their birthday.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.480]   I think about young adults here, porch goers,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.120]   who've thrown baby showers for complete and total strangers,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.280]   people they've never met because they heard
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.800]   that they were pregnant and no one was there
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.880]   to throw them a baby shower.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.160]   Why wouldn't we do this, man?
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   It is living the adventure.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.740]   I think about a guy who discipled a soccer team
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.400]   and he bought their lunch after the game,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.040]   which may not seem like a big deal to you
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.820]   except for he didn't eat
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.920]   'cause he didn't have money for himself.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.160]   I think about young adults who heard
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.760]   that someone was in need and they put $800
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.600]   in their mailbox so they could make rent.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.520]   Who, you ask?
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.600]   I don't know.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.040]   I heard the story secondhand.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.520]   They didn't wanna be named.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:05.800]   What do we do in living the adventure?
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.720]   What do we do today, today, to live this adventure
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.560]   of love, of just looking with the eyes of God
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.860]   and having so much fun and taking our resources
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.220]   and saying, hey, how do I share this?
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:20.220]   I wanna die with nothing in the bank account, man.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.700]   I wanna make sure that I was a pipe, not a pail,
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.740]   a conduit, not a container,
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.940]   that things, God's resources were flowing through me,
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.260]   not that I was collecting them for myself,
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.040]   building bigger barns.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.820]   And if I'm honest, as I think about all of these people,
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.700]   the ones that I know, can I tell you something?
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.000]   Like I'm like, what's the common denominator?
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.220]   You know what the common denominator is?
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.460]   They're all a little weird.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.500]   Just keeping it real.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.780]   They're all a little weird.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:52.700]   Like if you knew 'em, you're like, yeah,
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.420]   they just don't really quite fit into the world.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.160]   They're just not quite good at the world.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.340]   Maybe they belong to another world.
[00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:12.220]   Friends, sometimes I think they're the only ones that do.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.500]   Like I see what Jesus says,
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.460]   whatever you've not done for the least of these,
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.620]   you've not done for me.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.580]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.420]   the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.580]   Sometimes I love the world.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.020]   Does that mean the love of the Father's not in me?
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.940]   If anyone sees his brother or sister in need
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.140]   and does not meet his need,
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.140]   how can the love of the Father be in him?
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.660]   Man, these verses, wow.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.340]   Praise God for grace.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.620]   Receive grace.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.660]   Don't leave here with guilt.
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.420]   Leave here knowing you're missing out on the adventure.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.140]   In seasons, I'm missing out.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.700]   I'm doubling down.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.340]   You better believe it after preaching this message.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.340]   I'm doubling down on living the adventure.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.460]   It was Icys this week.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.820]   I don't know what it's gonna be next week.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.180]   I might go Oprah on him.
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.180]   If I could, I would.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.980]   (congregation laughing)
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:19.940]   I hope that's true.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:23.060]   You say, well, who do I love?
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:23.900]   Who do I love?
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.740]   Everyone always.
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:29.180]   My abusive, an abusive father, yeah, yeah, I love him.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.740]   A harsh boss, yeah.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.780]   A neighbor that's weird, especially the weird neighbor.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.940]   Even your enemy.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.380]   Even your enemy.
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.060]   And so how will you love someone tomorrow,
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.060]   and at what cost?
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.340]   You can only do it by surrendering to God's Spirit.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.380]   And so we love by spending time with God
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.940]   and surrendering to His Spirit.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:57.020]   In summary, love is giving of yourself
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.740]   for the benefit of others at a perceived cost to you.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.860]   Love sacrifices itself to serve others and fulfill the law.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.580]   And we love by spending time with God
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.140]   and surrendering to His Spirit.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:14.580]   Jesus says in John 13, verses 34 through 35,
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.900]   He says, "A new command I give you, love one another.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.500]   "As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.400]   "By this, your love for one another,
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.660]   "everyone will know that you are my disciples
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.220]   "if you love one another."
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:34.220]   The New Testament was written in the Greek language,
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.980]   most of it.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:43.900]   There's a word, agapetos, or agapeo, rather.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.100]   Agapeo is the verb for love.
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.380]   It's the verb form of love.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.780]   It's this love.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:55.620]   It's the way that a mother would sacrificially
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.220]   love her child.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.100]   It is giving preference to someone
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.660]   like they're your children.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.940]   That's agapeo.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.060]   Agapeo has been in the language for a long time.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.420]   In Homer's ancient writings, we see the word agapeo.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.220]   But a word that you might have heard of
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.160]   if you've been in church long, agape, it's a noun.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.220]   It didn't show up until they translated
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.300]   the Old Testament into Greek.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.040]   And they began to talk about the love
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.300]   that God's people had for one another.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.160]   And it's like they didn't have a word to describe it.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.020]   They're like, well, there's this word agapeo.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.180]   That's the way a mother would give preference to her child,
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.300]   but that's the way these God followers love everybody.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.260]   And so let's take the love that a mother gives her child
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.260]   and we'll make a noun out of that word, agape,
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.100]   and we'll say, hey, that's how God's people love everyone,
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.740]   the way that a mother sacrificially loves her children.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.420]   And a word was literally born, agape.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.420]   It was born to describe the remnant, God's people,
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.620]   because there was no other word to describe
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:06.100]   the way that these people love each other, agape.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:11.740]   Now, I live with an amazing mom.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:16.480]   The best mom I've ever known in my entire life is my wife.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.400]   She loves her children like no one loves anybody.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.300]   I mean, it's incredible.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.860]   And I can remember one time when our middle kid,
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.140]   my daughter was sick.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.540]   We didn't know what she had.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.620]   She was sick, she was running a fever.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.140]   And Monica had both of our daughters and she said,
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   hey, can you go to the doctor with me?
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.320]   And I'm thinking, I got to work tomorrow, you know,
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.220]   but Ephesians five, love your wife, you know, okay.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.180]   Does Christ love the church?
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.140]   Sure, I'm in.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.380]   And so I get to the, you know, I leave a meeting
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:53.060]   and I pull up to the doctor's office and I'm walking
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.100]   and as soon as I opened the door,
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.420]   I hear a very familiar scream.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.300]   It's the scream of my middle daughter
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.980]   and she's just screaming her head off.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.820]   And so I just followed the scream into the back room,
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.920]   into the, you know, the place where the patients are
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.820]   in the doctor's office.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   And I go in and when I walk in,
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.100]   I see this look on her face as she's screaming
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.980]   and she's about to blow chunks.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.740]   And so I'm there with my other daughter and I'm like,
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.940]   this is our kid, we need to go,
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.280]   we need to get out of here, you know?
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.660]   And she, but she's like, uh-uh, you're not going anywhere.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.420]   And like heat seeking missile, like looks at me
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.780]   and like across the room, just got it all over me.
[00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.820]   And I'm like, all right, I'm so out.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.560]   And then she turns to Monica, she's like,
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.060]   you're not gonna escape this either.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.000]   And blew up all over her and all over herself,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.260]   she's covered in it.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.300]   And I'm not trying to gross you out, okay?
[00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.380]   But it stunk.
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.740]   It smelled like the inside of a Six Flags trash can.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.900]   And I know, I know, you feel sorry for me.
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.900]   And I'm there and I'm literally, I'm like running away.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:04.820]   I'm like, I gotta get out of here, back to the car,
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.200]   what am I gonna do about this meeting?
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.200]   But my wife, she's like, come here.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.880]   She just pulled her clothes and she just grabs her
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.700]   and she just was gonna be okay.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:21.360]   I got you, I got you, it's gonna be okay.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.560]   And she's just consoling her.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.360]   And she's just getting it all over.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:34.480]   If you love someone like this, it's messy.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.080]   It's messy.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.680]   But this is how God loved you.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:46.080]   Man, you're stuck in your bulimia,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.560]   your porn addiction, and your debt,
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:57.080]   your codependency, your legalism, and your pride.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.240]   That gross abortion, the thing you thought
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.440]   you'd never tell anybody.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.180]   It's all over you, it's nasty, it stinks.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:09.080]   And God comes here and he grabs you.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.120]   He says, you're mine.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.000]   I love you.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.580]   He said, nothing's going to take you from me.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.880]   It's just this love that I have for you.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.980]   I want you to show to complete and perfect strangers,
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:31.160]   even your enemies, that you would love them like this.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:38.040]   And with that badge, we are God's representatives
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.120]   on this earth, showing his lost children
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.180]   how they can make it back to their father.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.080]   That's what we're doing.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.920]   And it is an amazing adventure
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.600]   that I just want to invite you on,
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.560]   that you would go on that adventure with me.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.760]   It's gonna be a blast.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.120]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:03.220]   Father, we love you.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.400]   We agape you.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.900]   We love you, not like we love chocolate.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.880]   Father, would you help us to love someone
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.320]   in a really crazy way and call it ordinary?
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.200]   Would you help us to do something
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.320]   at a tremendous cost to us and call it normative?
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.240]   Because we're the remnant, because we're your followers.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.920]   You've modeled it for us through your son, Jesus.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.740]   And so God, as we move towards worshiping you right now,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.940]   would you stir in our hearts a love for you?
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.860]   That we would sacrifice our lives for you,
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.900]   that we would, in view of your mercy,
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.820]   we would present our bodies as living sacrifices,
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.220]   holy and pleasing to you, and that we would see that
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.820]   as our spiritual act of worship,
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.700]   not conforming any longer to the patterns of this world,
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.220]   but being transformed by the renewing of our mind,
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.940]   having the mind of God.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.740]   Then we'd be able to test and improve
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.020]   what your will is for our lives,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.280]   your good, pleasing, perfect, and holy will.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.900]   In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:23.900]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
