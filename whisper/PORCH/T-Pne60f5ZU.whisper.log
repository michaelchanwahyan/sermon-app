[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   >> All right. Let's go Devstep. Okay. Anyone been to London ever before? It's a great city.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.960]   Yeah. I'm going to tell a story that will give us some direction for where we're going to head tonight.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.160]   I got to go with JP to London earlier this year in May.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.840]   There was a conference for kind of young pastors under 40.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.040]   We got to go be a part of it with 75 other people.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.000]   Basically we got a free trip to London, which was awesome.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.040]   It's like, hey, we're in.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:59.520]   And so while we're there, as we prepared to go over there, as JP has shared before, he has kind of been on a journey where he's had challenges in
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.680]   sleeping, some heart stuff and different things.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.480]   And so different times he's just struggled to sleep.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.360]   And when you travel, that can be exasperated.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.280]   And so in the days preparing for that, this was just something that was like, hey, man, just be praying for this.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.040]   Hey, praying for it.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.360]   I'm going to be a wingman over there.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880]   If you can't sleep, dude, I'll hang out with you.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.240]   We'll go see the sights, London Bridge, whatever you want to do.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.120]   We'll be together.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.840]   I'm in it with you.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.560]   And we'll just, you know, hang out if we can't end up sleeping.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.080]   And as he's journeyed through that, I mean, he's just like had all the different experiments where he has just tried kind of anything and
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.080]   everything that could help in that journey of sleeping from like, you know, these different teas to essential oils to just different kind of
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.200]   relaxation sleep stuff.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.080]   This is going somewhere.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.600]   So we get on the plane, go to London, get to the hotel.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.880]   Never been to a hotel in London.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.480]   Let me tell you something in case you've never been there before.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.160]   It's about this big, every single one of them.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.440]   So we're in the room, twin beds right next to each other, like six inches from each other.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.040]   It's like this bump.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.320]   Okay. And and we're preparing to go to bed.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.040]   He gets like the tackle box of sleep stuff out there.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.960]   And I'm like, hey, man, I'm in it.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.640]   We're with it together.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.040]   And we get ready to go to sleep.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.360]   And there's an eight hour time difference.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.240]   And and so, you know, it's, hey, see you in the morning.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.560]   Good night.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.240]   And all of a sudden, all kinds of anxiety like hit me.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.320]   My wife was eight months pregnant at the time.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.680]   And so I was like, eight months pregnant.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   Oh, my gosh, she could go into labor at any time.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.560]   How am I going to get home?
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.600]   If you got to get home fast, I'm like checking flights.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.160]   How fast can you get home?
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.680]   It's not very fast from London.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   That's not a real quick like I'll be there in an hour.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   It's like I'll see you tomorrow.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.320]   So good luck.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.680]   And and I just get hit with anxiety in this moment.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.840]   And I'm like, I can't sleep.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.560]   And poor JP, who's over there thinking I'm going to be here to support him.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.840]   He's like already snoozing off.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.600]   I'm like, JP, are you awake?
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.200]   It's like I am now.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800]   And I'm like, hey, can I try some tea?
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.040]   That's true.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.120]   I got me on that.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.260]   OK.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.600]   And so I'm like, I'm trying to get my tea.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.960]   He's like, dude, I got you covered, man.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.920]   You're in the you are in the hotel with the right guy.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.200]   He's getting the essential oils out.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.160]   We're like rubbing them on her.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.200]   Whatever that even does.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.040]   And and I'm like, man, I'm just still can't fall asleep.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.720]   You know, I go like I'm just going to go walk around for a little bit.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.920]   I'm like continue to just be plagued with anxiety.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   And you come back in.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.880]   He's like, dude, I got you.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.120]   Let me pull out the big guns.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.040]   Turns on this recording of some guy who does relaxation techniques where the guy's
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.520]   like, relax the pinky toe, tighten the pinky toe.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.360]   The pinky toe is falling asleep and he's different breathing.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.280]   True story.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.840]   All of that.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.480]   Can't make this stuff up, people.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.600]   And and I begin to listen to it.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.920]   And in some, you know, eventually I ended up falling asleep and I was just
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.040]   overwhelmed with anxiety.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.320]   The next day I remember thinking, man, what if I can't sleep again tonight?
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.200]   I was anxious even thinking about going to sleep.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I was just thinking how, you know, if something was to happen back home and
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   then once you kind of fall into this place of like I'm anxious about not sleeping, it
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.360]   makes you not able to sleep kind of just in general.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.080]   And and it was just this encounter with anxiety that was interrupting this trip.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.720]   And unexpectedly, honestly, anxiety, as often is the case, it's not one of those
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.880]   things you try to see happen or you even always anticipate happening.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.160]   It just kind of like out of nowhere just grabs you.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.120]   And all of a sudden you're like, man, I'm anxious about this.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.320]   And in that scenario, it clearly had power over my ability to sleep.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.000]   The funny thing, an interesting thing about anxiety is when you think about it, the
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.680]   level of power it has in so many different areas in our life or can have on our
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.040]   behavior is extraordinary.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.080]   I mean, how many people because of anxiety over do I have enough money?
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.480]   Can I provide for my family?
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.760]   You know, am I going to make enough to be financially secure?
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.800]   They become workaholics.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.120]   How many people end up marrying someone who's not God's best or someone who's not
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.720]   in line with who God in the Bible, the scripture says you should marry this type
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.520]   person? They settle because they're like, dude, I'm just worried this may be the last
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.400]   chance that I have.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.480]   How many people lie or are dishonest and don't totally tell the truth because they're
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.760]   worried about what someone else thinks about them?
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.720]   I mean, you think about the ways that anxiety some of you guys right now, you can't
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.040]   you're not even listening to most of what I'm saying because you're distracted,
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.160]   distracted over just a worry or an anxiety that is plaguing you right now, maybe from
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.560]   today, maybe in this room, maybe because you're like, who's she talking to right now?
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.160]   Maybe.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.240]   It's affecting you right now, but the power of anxiety is reality and can have
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.520]   tremendous power over our behavior.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.760]   And you think the great links think about all the ways that people attempt to find
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.720]   freedom from this anxiety.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.200]   I mean, some of the reasons that people either turn, you know, I hate I need a glass
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.840]   of wine or I need marijuana or I need some sort of medication is just because, you
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.120]   know, I need some relief from this.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.720]   Some people will turn to counseling because, hey, I need relief from this.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.000]   Some people will turn to man, I just every time I get anxious, I just got to clear my
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.760]   head, go watch every episode of the new Stranger Things series.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.120]   I need to go just numb myself through just binging on Netflix or I need to go to the
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.840]   gym, need to exercise that all of us will try to find different ways to cope with
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.760]   anxiety because we recognize, man, it can have a clear power over our thinking, over
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.600]   our health, over our focus, just over our ability to sleep, all kinds of different
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.920]   things.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.680]   And the further interesting thing is it's it's one of those things that no one wants
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.600]   in their life.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.400]   Like no one came into this room tonight and it was like, look, hey, I'll surrender
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.680]   everything to you, Lord, except the anxiety that I'm keeping all to myself because
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.040]   that's my little pet vice over here, just me and the anxiety.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.600]   Everyone would be like, dude, if it is possible to be free from anxiety, I would
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.720]   love to know how.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   And the good news is I think the Bible has a ton to say about this.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.320]   Anxiety is not something that's new.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.120]   Worry is something that's been taking place for thousands of years.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.320]   In fact, it was happening in Jesus's day and age and repeatedly in scripture, Jesus
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.160]   and the writers of the New Testament talk about anxiety and a path towards
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.200]   experiencing peace.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.480]   So tonight I want to look with you at some of the principles and truths that Jesus
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.520]   lays out in Matthew chapter six that provide an antidote and a solution that the
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.680]   more that you and I embrace, the more peace will be present in our lives.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.960]   So we're going to look at Jesus's teaching in Matthew chapter six, verses 24 through
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.320]   34.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.880]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open to Matthew chapter six, verses 24 through 34.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:35.800]   If not, it will be up on the screens as we look at Jesus's teachings on the subject,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.600]   what Jesus is going to lay out is really two truths about anxiety and then one
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.080]   solution to truths about anxiety and then one solution.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.880]   For experiencing freedom from anxiety, which is if you take notes, you write
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.760]   tonight's message is experiencing freedom or finding freedom from anxiety.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:03.720]   All right, we're going to start in verse 24 as Jesus launches into he gets to the
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.480]   conversation worried.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.400]   No one.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.560]   So Jesus is preaching.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.480]   It's called the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.320]   He's given a sermon.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.080]   Very first sermon goes in.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.840]   No one can serve two masters.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.920]   Either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to one and
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.080]   despise the other.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.840]   You cannot serve both God and money.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.080]   Therefore, I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.480]   will drink or about your body and what you will wear.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.160]   Jesus launches into the conversation of worry and he begins to address the things
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.520]   that his audience worried about.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.560]   And he brings up something that I'm going to come back to later, but he
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.920]   essentially in saying, hey, money and what you're going to wear and what you're
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   going to eat, he's addressing the things that his audience would have been most
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.600]   devoted to or the things they worried about.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.480]   And he addresses the fact that there's a relationship between what you worry about
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.640]   and what you're most devoted to, the things that you worry about reflect, hey,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.160]   these are the things that I'm kind of most committed, most devoted to.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.000]   And Jesus says, hey, there's a relationship between those two.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.000]   And I want you to know that there is a way to experience freedom from worry, so
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.800]   don't worry. And he addresses what his audience would have worried about to us.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.640]   He would have said whatever fill in the blank, your anxieties, your worries are.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.600]   But then he asked two questions that I really want to spend the bulk of this
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.240]   first point discussing with you, and here they are.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:26.920]   Isn't life more than food and the body more than clothes?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.320]   Again, he's addressing an agricultural society that food is a big deal.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.280]   There's no refrigeration.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.880]   There's no ability to there's no food trucks, no food camels, no anything like
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.760]   that that would allow them to like, oh, there's food right here.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.680]   It'd be like, oh, man, hey, I'm worried if we don't have enough food to eat to us.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.080]   He would say, hey, isn't life more than getting married?
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.600]   Isn't life more than having enough money in the bank account?
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.160]   Isn't life more than driving the right car?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.280]   Isn't life more than having the perfect roommate set up in life, more than getting
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.880]   into the right master's program?
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.240]   Not that those things don't matter and they're not important.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.760]   He would just say, whatever your worries are, isn't life more than those things?
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:12.600]   And then the second question in verse 27, and can any of you by worrying add a
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.120]   single hour to your life?
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.960]   That in other words, Jesus asked to just really on the face, simple questions, but
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.600]   profoundly true and just trying to get the whole audience on the same page.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.680]   Hey, let's all begin to talk about worry and let's address a couple of things.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.320]   Isn't life more than those things?
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.000]   And does worry positively contribute to your life?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.720]   Is worry helping you or hurting you?
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.480]   The answer to like, hey, can you add to your life by worrying about something?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.400]   No. A lot of us have taken life off by worrying about things.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.000]   But his point is simply this.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   The first idea is that worrying is always worthless.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.240]   And I know on the surface that seems so simple, but Jesus is beginning the
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.000]   conversation about worrying.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.640]   He's like, hey, let's all get on the same page.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.400]   Worrying never positively contributes to things.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.960]   It's not helpful.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.720]   And he's beginning to help his audience by asking the question, isn't life more
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.120]   than that?
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.640]   Deflate the power of the things that they worry about.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.240]   That's what he's attempting to do.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.760]   What I mean by that, anytime that you and I worry about something, it becomes like
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.120]   the thing that we're so focused on.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.440]   I'm distracted by I can't really even focus on what the world around me is.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.200]   What's going on?
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.320]   Because I'm just anxious over insert fill in the blank, whether or not this
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.920]   relationship is coming to an end, whether or not I'm going to have someone
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.960]   to live with me or I'm going to have to move apartments after my roommate moves
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.160]   out, whether or not, you know, after I bombed that presentation, I'm going to
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   get the promotion or what everyone at my work is thinking about me.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.400]   Whatever we're worried about can consume so much of our attention.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.360]   And Jesus is saying, hey, look, you're worried about things that at the end of
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.600]   the day, is that really all that life is about?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.920]   You're spending all of your time thinking about them and time equals life.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.160]   And so these things that are really not even at the end of the day, that big of
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.000]   a thing, and yet you're spending so much of your life focused on that.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.120]   And he's just trying to pull his audience back from the things they get hyper
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.600]   focused on.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.480]   Like his audience, you'd be like, oh, you're so concerned about food.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.920]   Is that all life is about?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.560]   Like if you had all the food in the world, you never had to worry about it.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.400]   Is that all you'd ever want ever?
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.120]   No.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:20.280]   Maybe it's, it's around marriage or singleness and to you, he would say,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.040]   look, it's life, marriage, life equals marriage.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.320]   Really?
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.240]   No, of course not.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.240]   Isn't life more than that?
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   If you think life equals marriage, that's all that it is.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.880]   It's because you are not married and someday you're going to get married and
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.960]   you'll be like, huh, yeah, this is great.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.280]   But yeah, it's just that there's so much more.
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:42.520]   And Jesus is saying to his audience and whatever you worry about, he's saying,
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.320]   man, isn't life so much more than this?
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.640]   The thing that's getting all your attention, the thing that you're so focused
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:47.800]   on.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.280]   And he's trying to deflate the power of the worry.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.080]   Really?
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:58.480]   Uh, the genius here is that today counseling and psychology is still catching up to
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.480]   what Jesus did right here.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.760]   Cause they do a form of this.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.240]   If you ever go to counseling around anxiety and go see someone, they'll do a
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.440]   form where they'll attempt to deflate the power of worry.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.200]   So I'm married to a counselor, so I'm like in counseling every single day and it's
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.480]   like, it's not working.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:20.320]   And, uh, and, uh, and my wife would say, and counselors would say, there's a form
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.720]   that takes place where counselors will hope you do this today, where they'll
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.520]   attempt to just help you, uh, deflate the power of the worries that you experience
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.720]   and help you see them for what they are.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.520]   And so, uh, for example, one variation of this where they're, they're essentially
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   doing what Jesus did back then, where if you came in and you're like, man, I'm just
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.000]   so anxious, I'm going to lose my job.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.920]   And they'll just help you chase down what you're worrying about.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.120]   Okay.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.400]   Well, what happens if you lose your job?
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.840]   Well, I guess I'd have to look for another job.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.520]   What happens if you have to look for another job?
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.640]   Well, I, you know, if I don't find something quick, I'd have to maybe get rid
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.720]   of my, you know, my lease on my car.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.320]   I'd have to change it in and get a new car.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.440]   What if you have to get a new car?
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.520]   Well, I probably have to get like a clunker cause I don't have much in savings.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.080]   And what if you have to get a clunker?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.160]   I guess I'd be embarrassed to drive my clunker around and what people are going to
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.680]   think about me.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.600]   Got it.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:04.920]   Okay.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.600]   You're not worried about whether you lose your job.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.920]   You're worried about what people are going to think about you if you drive a
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.400]   clunker and just chase it down.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.160]   What if I can't sleep tonight?
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.200]   What if you can't sleep tonight?
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.640]   I guess I'm going to be really tired tomorrow.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.880]   What if you're really tired tomorrow?
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.920]   I guess I'm going to be really tired tomorrow.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.600]   And just helping chase.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.960]   I mean, it's truly, I've just saved you guys like 125 bucks an hour.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.480]   You're welcome.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:31.800]   Okay.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.440]   That's just free.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.040]   But they're doing still today.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.120]   Psychology is catching up to a Jesus 2000 years ago was going, Hey guys, let's just
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.640]   all see the things that we're worried about for what they are.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.280]   Not that they're not important, but they're certainly not the epitome of what life is
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:48.760]   all about.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.600]   Despite the fact that they're getting all of your attention and you're spending so
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.760]   much of your life focused on.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.560]   And he continues.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.800]   Further asked the question of verse 27 of, Hey, just worry, add to your life.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   And, um, even medical studies have come out and said, I mean, it's clear.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.960]   Worry has a detrimental effect on the human body.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.320]   Charles Mayo, the Mayo clinic.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.480]   If you know that it is said this worry affects the circulation, the heart glands, the
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.560]   entire nervous system.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.680]   I've never known a man who died of overwork, but I've known a whole lot who have died
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.600]   of worry.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.280]   So in Jesus's words, he's just saying, Hey, worry is never helpful.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.480]   As we launched into this conversation, let's all get on the same page about that.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.680]   Worry is worthless.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.520]   But here's what's interesting.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.680]   Knowing worry is worthless.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.240]   It's kind of worthless.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.320]   It's like, oh, yeah, in other words, me being like, Hey, worry is worthless, stop it.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.760]   Nobody's like, all right, all my worries are gone, I'm done, let's close in prayer right
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.040]   now.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.600]   No one would say that.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   Shut it down.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.520]   But the good news is Jesus doesn't stop there.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:01.240]   He continues and says, Why, as followers of Christ or Christians, you and I don't have
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.040]   to experience worry.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.320]   And he continues the conversation.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   As he just is bringing us to the fact that it is possible to experience freedom from
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.520]   worry. And he goes into an illustration.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.120]   Here's what he says.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.240]   Verse 26.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.440]   Look at the birds of the air.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.720]   They do not reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly father feeds them.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.640]   Are you not much more valuable to God than a bird?
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.280]   And why do you worry about your clothes?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.040]   See how the flowers in the field grow, they do not labor or spin.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.000]   Yet I tell you that not even Solomon and all of his splendor was dressed like one of
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.040]   these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.240]   tomorrow is thrown in the fire, will he not much more clothed you?
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.080]   Oh, you have little faith.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.760]   Sad note, Jesus points out there's a relationship between the size of your faith
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.440]   and the size of your worry.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.240]   But you have little faith.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:04.520]   So do not worry saying, What should we or what should we drink or what should we
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:09.960]   wear for the pagans, the pagans, a person who doesn't have a relationship with God, a
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.160]   pagan is a person who doesn't have a heavenly father as God.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.400]   It would be the rest of the world, if you will, the pagans run after all of these
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.320]   things, their focus, they're pursuing all of these things, and your heavenly father
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.360]   knows that you need them.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.040]   Jesus says that you and I, as Christians, are different.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.480]   One of the reasons you do not have to worry is because you have a heavenly father.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.840]   You're not like the rest of the world who doesn't have anyone watching and looking
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.320]   out for the back as Christians.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.720]   Who have a heavenly father, who are children of God, the Bible teaches have someone or
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.440]   have a heavenly father who's caring, who's providing, who's concerned and is promised
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.520]   to look after their needs.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.680]   And he's inviting you, you do not have to worry.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.200]   He's not saying don't care.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   He's not saying don't try.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.400]   He's not saying is not Jesus version of like, dude, it's all chill.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.600]   Just, you know, keep it cool.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:07.000]   It's not saying that he's not saying don't work hard, fill out the applications, follow
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.120]   up, be diligent, do all of those things, work really hard.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.400]   And then at the end of the day, he's saying, I'm inviting you to sleep well and not worry
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.240]   because you have a heavenly father who's promised I will provide for your needs, not
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.520]   your wants, your needs.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.720]   The second idea from the text that Jesus lays out is that you, if you're a Christian, you
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.360]   do not have to worry because God will meet your needs.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.680]   God has promised I will meet your needs.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.040]   There's a guy named John Owen who lived a couple hundred years ago, was a famous pastor,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.800]   if you will. And he just said, hey, worry for a Christian is irrational because it is
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.680]   as a Christian, you're someone who says, God, I trust you with all of eternity, with all
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.840]   of my life, all of my sin.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.080]   I trust you with all of it, God.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.760]   I just don't trust you with Thursday.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.400]   He would say that's irrational.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.400]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.960]   It's a human experience that grabs all of us, but it is an irrational thing.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.600]   I trust you with it all, just not tomorrow and not this.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.520]   At this, I'm afraid you're going to mess up or this may be too big for you to handle.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.280]   You just said it is irrational because they believe their heavenly father is a provider
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.800]   who's promised to meet the needs that they have.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.160]   Jesus in this passage four times says, do not worry.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.640]   Hey, you don't have to worry.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.760]   Don't worry.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.920]   Don't worry.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.480]   Do you know what the most commanded?
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.320]   Most repeated command, I'm sorry, in all of the Bible is.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.280]   Do not fear.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.360]   Don't be afraid.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.920]   Don't worry.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.320]   Fear not.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.160]   More than hey, don't get drunk more than hey, don't sleep around more than hey, don't
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.200]   get angry and hit people more than any of those things.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.400]   Do not fear.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.320]   Three hundred and sixty six times.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.640]   Do not fear.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.360]   Do not fear.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.120]   Think about that.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:02.040]   That is one for every single day of the year, including leap year.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.440]   It's as though God is very clearly trying to communicate a message.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.680]   I do not want my people to live in fear.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.520]   They're going to face uncertainty.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.160]   Life is not going to go the way that they always want it to.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.120]   Life is hard.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.440]   And in this world, they will have trouble.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:22.200]   But God says I am inviting them to a life where they can face future uncertainty and
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.840]   not be afraid because they know their heavenly father is working to provide for their needs,
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.720]   not their wants every time.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.360]   But he has promised I love you.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.280]   I am for you.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.520]   You do not have to worry.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.720]   I will provide for you.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.720]   I've got your back.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.240]   Don't let anxiety.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.480]   Push you into the same self-centered, I'm concerned about getting more for me, me, me,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.920]   me, that the rest of the world, that's pagans are running after because you have a
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.360]   heavenly father who said, I got you, I will provide.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.240]   Even by saying, do not worry, he is implying.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.040]   I got you.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.880]   By saying, do not worry, he's implying I got you.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.000]   And if he's not, he's not a good God.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.920]   What I mean, if he's saying, hey, don't worry, but I don't really don't have you
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.440]   covered, he would not be a good heavenly father.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.520]   You wouldn't say someone is a good friend if they did that to you.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.680]   Like if we tonight we were going, we're going to dinner afterwards, we're leaving.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.840]   Oh, yeah, we're going to Matito's.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.080]   Great.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.320]   We're walking out and you're like, oh, man, I forgot my wallet.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.480]   I'm like, hey, don't worry about it.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.600]   We go to Matito's, get there, we're eating food and the bill comes up and he's like
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.560]   one check, two checks, two checks.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.880]   You would look at me like, what you said, don't worry.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.280]   And if I said you thought I was going to pay for you, no, I didn't mean I was going
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:40.680]   to pay for you.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.240]   I just want you to be distracted and, you know, discouraged while we're eating the
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.800]   meal right here.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.120]   Have fun washing dishes.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.560]   That's great.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.120]   You wouldn't be like, you're a great friend.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.920]   You'd say, what is wrong with you?
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.840]   You're a terrible friend.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:00.840]   What kind of God says, hey, don't worry, and then says, but you're on your own.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   Does that make any sense?
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.080]   He's clearly saying, I got you.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.040]   I'm promising to provide for your needs.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:14.080]   No, no one would say there's a such thing as a good parent, a good father or a good
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.000]   mother who can meet the needs of their children and doesn't.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   No one would say that's a good parent.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.640]   Think about the lengths that parents go to to provide for the needs of their
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.280]   children. Think about the needs that people go to any dog moms in the room in
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.600]   here and dog dads.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.080]   There are more dog dads in here.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.160]   I am I'm concerned.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.280]   So this is a new thing, I think.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.160]   Let me just address this here for a second.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.480]   The dog mom phenomenon feels new.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.800]   Here's what I mean by dog mom.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.360]   I don't just mean you have a dog.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.320]   I mean, you see this dog as your child.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.480]   And so you're you know, you had a Halloween costume for them.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.000]   You are every time you go into the grocery store, you're like, oh, my gosh, get to
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.200]   get a new toy for Fido.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:08.520]   OK, and you see this this child as like you're are you see this dog as your child?
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.240]   You're like, no, you had it right the first time.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.200]   And this seems like a new phenomenon.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.640]   I mean, I mean, there's a girl on our team.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.080]   The lengths that she goes just to like, you know, here's a sweater and and I don't
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.040]   want to call names, Emily.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.280]   But she I mean, she gives her dogs middle names.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.240]   If you are giving your dogs middle names, there's something wrong.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.480]   OK, and you are dismissed.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:36.000]   OK, now, let's see the links that you go to to provide for her dogs.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.200]   Now, let me ask you a question.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.600]   Do you think that she loves her dogs more than God loves you?
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:52.960]   Do you think that whatever dog mom, you know, the best in the world has a greater
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.440]   amount of love for her dog than God has for you?
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.880]   Of course not.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.440]   He's already proven it.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.360]   But the links that he'll go to to provide for your needs, including your ultimate
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.680]   need, includes giving the life of his only son dying in your place.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.520]   That there is no greater amount of love someone could have, there is no even
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.360]   ability for us to comprehend the love that God has for us, the Bible says.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.240]   It's literally something you have to pray, God, will you help me to comprehend more
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.520]   of it? Because you're such you're a God who loves me so much I cannot on my own
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.160]   comprehend it. That's a feature to chapter three.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.400]   But if we were honest.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.680]   Most of us often fail to believe that.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.800]   Struggle to believe that, man, God, you really you love me more than any human
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.560]   love I've ever seen expressed towards a child, to the dog.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:52.520]   And the God who's there says, I got you, I promise I will provide for you.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:58.920]   And let me clarify again, it is not I will provide for all of your wants, he
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.840]   promises I will provide for your needs.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.000]   You may think you know what you need, God actually knows what you need.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.880]   And he promises I will provide for your needs, I got you.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.800]   It's clear, I mean, even if you just look back in your own life, if you're
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.640]   anything like me, that I'm not always the best determiner of, hey, I really want
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.320]   this, God, this would be great, would you please give it to me?
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.240]   And then years later, I look back and I'm like, oh, my gosh, I'm so thankful you
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.160]   did not give her to me or job to me or school.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.200]   I mean, think about it, think about the people maybe in your past boyfriend,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.800]   girlfriend, relationships that you had, a college that you were just begging, God,
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.760]   please let me get into.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.960]   And he didn't answer that prayer.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.920]   And you look back and you're like, man, I'm so thankful that that ended up not
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:49.120]   being the way it went, that we're not great at determining what we want or what
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.080]   is even best for us.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.320]   And not great at determining what we need, but the God who's there says, I know what
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.000]   you need and I promise I will provide it like I provided by sending my son to die
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.640]   on a cross.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.880]   I got you.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.800]   You do not have to live like the rest of the world.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:10.360]   So Jesus's worry is worthless and worry for Christians is irrational because we
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.880]   have a heavenly father who has promised, I will provide for my needs, for your
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.320]   needs.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.960]   A heavenly father who's in control, who loves you and is working for your good,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.600]   as it's been said many times, we do not know what tomorrow holds as Christians,
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.400]   but we are the only people in the world who know the one who holds tomorrow.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.960]   Christians do not know what tomorrow has for you, for me, for any of us, but we're
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.720]   the only people on this planet who know the one who holds tomorrow.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.320]   And every tomorrow after it, and he said, I got you, you can trust me.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.200]   I got you.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.400]   And then Jesus goes into what I think is one of the most profound truths.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.520]   That I believe if you begin to practice and put it into practice, you'll
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.960]   experience increasing freedom from anxiety inside of your life, where he lays
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.560]   out a verse that candidly, I think some people, if you were raised in church, you
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.880]   have heard so many times.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.600]   And you've never actually paused to think about what Jesus is actually saying here.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.480]   And so it's a verse, you're like, oh, yeah, I heard that one before.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.920]   But if you pause, look at it.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:27.120]   There's an incredible principle, an antidote to the anxiety that exists in a
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:27.760]   lot of our lives.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.480]   Here's what he says.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.600]   But seek first.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.360]   Hey, I don't want you to have to worry, you don't have to worry, Heavenly Father
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.240]   loves you, he will provide, but here's what you need to do.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.640]   Seek that same word, seek is translated desire first or prioritize first embrace
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.480]   as the very first thing.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.880]   Put on the throne of your life, if you will, this is the first thing.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.560]   God's kingdom.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.800]   What is what that's a weird world there, what does that mean?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.520]   Heaven, what do you mean by that?
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.440]   The word kingdom all throughout the Bible is essentially God's reign, God's rule,
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.520]   God's will.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:14.800]   Prioritize first place as first in your world, in your life, God's agenda.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:15.640]   For you.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.080]   And his righteousness and all of these things will be given to you as well.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow, we'll worry about it, say
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.400]   self, each day has enough trouble of its own, take a day at a time, day at a time.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.120]   What is you saying?
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:36.160]   Jesus says, hey, I want you to desire your first place as first on the heart and
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.000]   throne of your life.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   God's kingdom, God's agenda for your life, God's will for you.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.680]   Both his revealed will in the Bible.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:51.480]   And his revealing will as it unfolds in front of you.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:56.680]   And his sovereign plan unfolds in front of your life.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:02.600]   Embrace first God's agenda for your life, in other words, Jesus says, don't let
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.640]   there be any competition for whose agenda is in first place, yours or God's.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.000]   All of us came in this room, we got an agenda for your life or you have one, I
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.280]   got one for my life. It doesn't involve cancer.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.280]   It doesn't involve, you know, having a losing a child.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.080]   It doesn't involve being single for years and years and years.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.320]   I got an agenda for my life.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.960]   I got a will that I want to see happen.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.080]   And Jesus says, place as first in your life, God's agenda above your own.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.200]   Prioritize first God's agenda above your own and you'll experience peace.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.400]   You will begin to experience peace.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.080]   Here's why this is so relevant and think about it.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.320]   Remember we talked about devotion.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.960]   He's saying be most devoted to God's will for your life.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.120]   God's agenda, not yours.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.680]   And you'll experience peace.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:50.960]   Because what you are most devoted to determines what you worry about, be most
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.640]   devoted to that. What does that mean?
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.000]   I mean, think about your worries.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.640]   Here's what I know about my words, I'll talk about me.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.000]   I worry about my wants, about my agenda.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.800]   I'm not worried that God's going to mess up his plan.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.120]   I'm not like, God, you're out there and I just think you may have made a mistake
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.920]   yesterday and all that. I'm worried he's going to get it wrong by my standard.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.880]   Not by God's.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.120]   I worry about my wants.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.760]   I worry about getting my agenda fulfilled.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:22.440]   And he says, look, I want you to place as first importance or embrace first, not
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.680]   your desire for your life, David, but God's plan and God's agenda for your life.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:34.840]   Because like I said, I worry, essentially my worries are like, hey, I'm not going to
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.960]   get everything that I want.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.040]   That's the things that I worry about.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.760]   Like, I'm not worried that I'm not going to get everything that I want.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   Which is crazy.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.920]   And you worry about you not getting the things that you want.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:54.280]   And it's crazy, I say, because the reality for all of us is you're not going to get
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.400]   what you want all of the time, every time for the rest of your life.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.560]   It just is not going to happen.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   It hasn't happened already, unless you're like 30 seconds old.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.840]   You will not get, you're going to live the rest of your life.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.000]   You're not going to get everything that you want.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.920]   And so we worry about not getting everything you want.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.280]   You're not going to get everything you want.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.120]   So here's what you can have.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:22.400]   You can either have not everything that you want in life and worry or not everything
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.640]   that you want in life and peace.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.360]   You're going to not get everything you want both ways.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.000]   That's just true.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.200]   You came in or not, you're going to leave.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:30.760]   Sorry.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.480]   I hate to burst the bubble, but you're not always going to get everything that you want
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.000]   in life.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.160]   And so Jesus says, you can either have worry or peace.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.680]   God, things are not going the way that I wanted them to.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.200]   I trust you.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.880]   God, things are not going the way that I saw them going as it relates to, you know, my
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.480]   dating life and lack thereof.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.400]   But I trust you.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.640]   And I'm trying to trust you more.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.400]   Will you help me?
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:03.320]   That he says, will you begin to place as first on the throne, God's agenda as it
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.000]   sovereignly unfolds before you?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.720]   God, I trust you.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:19.040]   In case you're still not following me, he brings up something he mentioned 20 verses
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.080]   earlier, 20 verses earlier.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.800]   He alludes to the same idea when he says, this is how you should pray.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.880]   You guys probably remember this.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.800]   If you grew up in church on the Lord's prayer.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.080]   Hey, let me teach you guys how to pray.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.840]   You want to know how to pray?
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.280]   And he brings up the very idea that we're talking about.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.720]   When you pray, you say our father in heaven, holy or hallowed is your name.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.880]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.960]   What does he mean by earth?
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.400]   That means in my world, on the dirt that I walk in, in my life, your will, your
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.760]   kingdom come, your agenda for my life before my own, your will be done in my
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.720]   earth, on the dirt that I live and walk on.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   I'm embracing that as the first thing and the first priority, and I'm asking you to
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.920]   bring it about in my life.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.240]   Jesus illustrates this exact idea about what does it look like?
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.480]   You begin to experience peace by just saying, God, Hey.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.280]   You know how badly I need this job.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.440]   And I don't know what I'm gonna do if I can't afford to make rent.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.080]   Will you please help me to get this job?
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.040]   And if you don't, if your will is something else, I trust you.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.960]   I trust you.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.120]   Your kingdom, your agenda before my own.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.520]   This would be on my agenda.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.120]   Let's make no mistake.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.400]   Let me be abundantly clear.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.480]   But if that's not in your agenda, I trust you.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.600]   Jesus models this exact idea.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.120]   In the only moment in scripture, we're told that Jesus was overwhelmed looking at
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.960]   future events.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.040]   There's only one time.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.440]   It's in the Garden of Gethsemane where he's hours away from being crucified, and
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.080]   we're told that he was overwhelmed with sorrow as he looked at the future.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.560]   And in that moment, he expressed exactly what we're seeing.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.760]   God, let this not happen, but not as I will, but you will.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.320]   He says this in Mark chapter 14.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:12.200]   Verses 34 and 36, going a little further, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed, if it
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.880]   is possible with this hour pass from him, Abba, Father, he said, everything is
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.760]   possible for you.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.840]   Take this cup from me or don't make it so I have to go die on a cross.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.920]   Yet not what I will, but what you will.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:33.080]   That I'm placing above my own desires, your will for my life, God.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:39.160]   And if you will begin to practice that, you're going to experience peace on the
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.200]   big things in your world, in your life.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.040]   God, my mom just got diagnosed with cancer.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.080]   I'm overwhelmed.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.520]   What's going to happen?
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:51.040]   Lord, will you please not allow her to have anything other than a healthy, fully
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.040]   healthy and fully restored body?
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.560]   But if that's not the story you're writing, I trust you.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.680]   I mean, what other option do you have?
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.000]   I guess worry.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.160]   You're not going to thwart the plan of God.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.400]   Again, it's like one of those things, even this idea of being like, God, look,
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.840]   hey, you know how desperately I want to have children and I'm afraid that maybe
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.200]   that's not going to be in the cards for me.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.080]   And God, I can't even imagine that being the case.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.680]   And so I'm struggling to trust you, but God, if that's your will, I trust you.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.200]   Will you help me trust you more?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:28.920]   I trust you.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:39.280]   The idea of even what I'm saying is hard because just like what I mentioned
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.640]   earlier, it feels like we're giving up control.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.360]   Like, God, man, I'm just, I'm giving God control back.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.600]   Newsflash.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.120]   You don't have control.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.040]   And neither do I.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.760]   So you're not giving anything up.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:57.240]   You're either going to have no control and peace or no control and worry.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.480]   You're going to have no control either way.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   You get to choose which one.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.520]   And Jesus is saying, I'm inviting you to have peace in your experience.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.200]   People even use the phrase like, hey, I struggle with control.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.320]   That is like saying, hey, I struggle with, um, with x-ray vision.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.360]   That is a myth.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.840]   You have never had control.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.200]   You will never have control.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.880]   There's only one person who has control.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.320]   That's God.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.360]   That's like me saying, I really struggle with sovereignty.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.960]   That is a myth.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.000]   And God who's there saying, hey, you have no control.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.680]   You never will.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.480]   I have control and I love you.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:31.960]   I'm for you.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.720]   You can either have no control and anxious or, and worry or no control and peace.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.480]   You decide.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:42.720]   I had a friend who was recently going through and he had, um, started his own
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.480]   business and through some accounting errors with his accountant, he owed the
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.560]   IRS tons of money.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.080]   He was overwhelmed with like, man, I'm afraid that I'm going to lose this
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:50.440]   house.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   I'm going to lose my house.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.600]   I'm going to lose my job.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.680]   I'm going to lose my company.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.360]   I'm just like, I mean, he was overwhelmed with anxiety and he began to just pray
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.160]   this prayer like, God, I don't want to lose my house.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.880]   I don't want to lose my job.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.920]   I don't want to lose me all that I own.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.520]   But if that's what you're doing and that's what you want, I trust you.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.320]   I don't understand why that would be what you want, but if that's what you
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.240]   want, I know you love me.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.680]   You proved it by dying in my place and I trust you.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.000]   I'm trying to trust you more.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.640]   Please don't let that happen, but I trust you.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:30.320]   I'm not going to thwart your plan, but I can't experience peace.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.440]   And the God who's there is inviting you on the small stuff.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.520]   Maybe you're just anxious over like, Hey, you know, I mean, just, we all get
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.960]   anxious about the most petty things.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.600]   Like, um, I just broke up with my girlfriend and I think she's going on
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.400]   other dates with a guy.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.560]   And I'm like, Oh my gosh, I can't believe she's going on other dates with a guy.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.040]   That's unbelievable.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.800]   What if they end up getting married?
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.600]   I thought she was the one for me.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.400]   We can all just get distracted and overwhelmed and just practicing like God.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.920]   If that's your will, I trust you.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.120]   I trust you.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.720]   I don't know what's going on in your world and in your life right now and
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.200]   then across the board, I could, we could go every single person in here.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.880]   And today, anxiety attempted to grab ahold of you.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:14.080]   And the God who's there saying, if you will begin to replace your agenda with
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.680]   God's agenda, you'll experience peace.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.760]   What I know put in my notes of the third point from tonight is you will relieve
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:24.280]   your worries by replacing your agenda for God's.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:30.800]   You will begin to relieve your worries by replacing your agenda for God's agenda.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:36.160]   The apostle Paul years later would pick up on Jesus's exact teaching where he
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.120]   would say this, do not be anxious about anything.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.720]   But in every situation, no matter what you're facing, pray.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.920]   And petition, which is ask God.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.880]   It's saying the same thing.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:57.760]   With Thanksgiving, present your request to God.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.840]   That's the third time he says the same thing in different words.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.760]   Pray, talk to God.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.480]   Petition, tell God what you need.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.680]   Present your request to God.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.920]   Tell God what you need.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.600]   He's very repetitive.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.720]   When you're anxious, here's what I want you to do.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.480]   Talk to God.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:22.600]   And the peace of God will transcend, which transcends all understanding will guard
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.160]   your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.520]   Do you know what he's implying there?
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.080]   The only way that you're going to have peace when you tell God that stuff, when
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:33.200]   you bring your requests to God, is if you believe that God is in control and he's
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:33.960]   working for your good.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.920]   You're not going to have peace any other way.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   The verse clearly, and Paul clearly is saying like, hey, when you're
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.800]   overwhelmed, pray, tell God, hey, this is what I'm overwhelmed.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.560]   This is what's going on.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.680]   God, will you please change this?
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.600]   And if not, I trust you.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.040]   And you will experience peace.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.560]   You can wake up tomorrow.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.440]   And if you begin to do that, and some of you, you need to do this tonight.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.640]   You need to do it right now.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.200]   You need to verbalize it.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:03.080]   There is something powerful about when you speak the words, God, I trust you.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.600]   It does something to your heart.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.440]   And so you may need to leave.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.840]   You may need to, after this is over, go find a place by yourself, just in your
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.080]   car.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.600]   God, you know how badly I want whatever.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:19.200]   God, you know how scared I am about whatever you fill in the blank.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.200]   And please don't allow that to happen.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.800]   But God, if it does, I trust you.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.000]   Will you help me trust you more?
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.200]   And there is power even in verbalizing the words that I trust you.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.560]   I'm struggling to trust you, but I trust you.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.320]   Will you help me trust you more?
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.520]   And you will begin to experience peace.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.240]   As you face uncertainty.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.120]   Let me close here and I'll invite the band to come back up.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:56.280]   I, um, over the past year, this has become so real to me.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   Last fall, we discovered that we were pregnant.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.040]   We were going to have another child and we were so excited.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:08.840]   And then in early December, about 10 weeks in, after we had already done a,
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.400]   you know, a test around the baby and discovering that we got a phone call at
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.360]   930 on a Wednesday night, and it was a doctor who said, Hey, I need to talk to
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:15.960]   you and your husband.
[00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:21.480]   The test results came back and we're so excited you're having a baby girl, but it
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.400]   also came back and there's a decent chance that she's going to have a
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.360]   chromosomal disorder.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:29.080]   And there's a 90% chance that she'll die before she ever gets born.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.800]   And if she is born and she has this, then she will have immediate heart
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.720]   transplant and heart surgery right there.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.360]   And she'll live the rest of her life with severe complications.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.480]   She'll never have the ability to have children herself.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.720]   She'll have physical implications because of this defect.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.080]   And she'll require medical attention the rest of her life.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.680]   And it was like a bomb went off.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.560]   And I know most of you guys don't have kids and someday you will, and it's going
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.120]   to be awesome.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:55.920]   It's the greatest thing ever.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.240]   But in that moment, it's like, it's like a bomb.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.320]   By that, I just mean like the, you know, we've all seen the scenes in the movies
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.600]   where your ears are ringing and everything's going in slow motion and
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.960]   you're just trying to grab your thoughts.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.280]   And that led us on a nine month journey.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.400]   We wouldn't know, she told us, every day gets a little bit better.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.280]   If she survives, that's a great thing.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.600]   And for the next nine months, but it would be nine because we wouldn't know
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.200]   until she was here.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.400]   It just drove us to embrace this like I've never embraced it.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.320]   And this wasn't some like preaching thing and you got to do this.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.680]   It was like, God, this is life.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.240]   We don't want our daughter to die.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.320]   Will you save, will you spare our baby girl?
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.440]   And if that's not what you want, I don't understand why, but I trust you and I'm
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.320]   trying to trust you.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.560]   Will you allow her to be healthy?
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.800]   I mean, all of a sudden you can imagine if you're in ministry, you're like, how
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.680]   am I going to afford all the different medical attention for the rest of them?
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.400]   I'm in ministry.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:59.920]   If that's what I, if that is your will, God, I'm going to stop it.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.240]   I trust you.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.200]   What option do I have?
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   Help me to trust you more.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.280]   And everything came into focus.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.080]   We prayed our prayers and cried lots of tears and prayed a lot more.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:23.960]   And I wish that I could say like, Hey, every moment in those nine months, it was
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.520]   one where we just said, God, Hey, we trust you.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.360]   I can't, I don't even know that I can say majority of them.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:33.280]   A majority of our life was filled with moments.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:36.640]   I trust you, but I can't say this.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:44.600]   Every moment with peace was every moment where we experienced peace was one.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.560]   We just said, God, we trust you.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:53.040]   Your agenda comes before my own and I don't understand why you would do that.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.320]   But if that's your will, your will be done.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.360]   I trust you.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:06.840]   And, um, June 29th, our daughter was born and she was healthy and I think God was
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.800]   growing my faith.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.040]   I think he was going, Hey, David, do you trust me?
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:16.560]   And I hope that I would say yes, had things not gone the way that they did.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.600]   And I'm not foolish enough to stand up here and be like, yeah, and I would have.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.840]   But I do know.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.960]   That if I'm going to experience peace, it's going to come by just opening up my
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.160]   hands and they're already open.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:31.800]   Let's be honest.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.320]   We're trying to grab for something that's not ours.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.560]   And he's saying, will you trust me?
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.680]   And if you do, you'll experience peace.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.040]   I don't know what you're walking through in this room, but I know the God who's
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.200]   there.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:41.800]   He loves you.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.000]   He will provide for you.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.640]   He's promised to meet your needs.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.080]   And he is working for your good and he is your heavenly father.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.560]   And he's inviting you.
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.680]   Will you trust him?
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.880]   I want to pray and I want to invite you to do something.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.240]   If you guys would just bow and just close our eyes and pray.
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:07.760]   And I want, if you were in the room right now, you just close your eyes and you are
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.960]   walking through something where you are anxious.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.160]   It could be something big.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.080]   It could be something small.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.640]   It could be anything and everything in between, but you know that there's just
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.800]   something gripping at your heart.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.880]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.680]   And so if you're in the room right now, I want you to close your eyes.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:25.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:27.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:31.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:45.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:48.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:49.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:53.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:56.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:57.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:58.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:00.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:05.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.720]   I want you to pray for me.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:15.500]   The God of all peace would raise their awareness of you in their life.
[00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.820]   Their awareness that you're working for their good, that you haven't forgotten them, that
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:26.020]   you've promised to provide for them, that you're crazy about them, that you are in control.
[00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:32.300]   I pray that you would be more real than the fear in this moment right now.
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:38.520]   In the moments as they leave here, would you eclipse any of the fear, of the sadness, of
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.760]   the circumstances in their life and be bigger than those things?
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   And I don't even fully know how to best ask for that.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.800]   But I pray that you and your spirit would just flood their hearts and minds with peace
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.160]   and you would guard their minds and hearts with peace that only comes from you, the Prince
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.560]   of Peace.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:06.040]   Father, for friends who need to leave and they, tonight, need to just verbalize, God,
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   I trust you.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.800]   Will you help me trust you?
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.360]   And will you pour down favor on just my friends in the workplaces and the relationships that
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.640]   they have and all that they do?
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   Would they honor you and would they, above everything, trust you, no matter the circumstances
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   that we face?
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   We love you.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   We worship you in song.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   Amen.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
