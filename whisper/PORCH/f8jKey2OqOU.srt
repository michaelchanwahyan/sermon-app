1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
 Oh yeah, I don't know if you've seen that. That is the ad campaign for Mac.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,640
 Just this whole idea, I'm a Mac, you're a PC. Right? And so I don't know, as you

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,040
 watch that, you probably have a favorite. Some of you are like, yeah, I just don't

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,720
 get the Mac, the finger commands. It doesn't really work for me. I really like

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,120
 my PC. Maybe for you it carries over to the the iPhone or the Google Android or

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,600
 whatever that is. But here's what I want to point out to you up front. Is that

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,560
 both of these machines, right, I've got the Mac, I've got the Dell or the PC, if

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,280
 you will, they're both given value by their manufacturer. Right? If you want a

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,400
 computer, you don't just want a computer, you want a Mac or you want a Dell or you

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,000
 have some specific computer in mind. They're both the same value. You can

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,040
 get either one for $11.99 at Best Buy. Okay? And the difference between the two

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:02,000
 is both a difference of hardware, the outside, and a difference of software, the

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,680
 inside. Right? And it's interesting because I bought this hard drive online.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,280
 I wanted to go ahead and take all these pictures I've been taking with my iPhone

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,960
 of the kids and all of these videos. And I thought I'd get an external hard

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,920
 drive. And I'm a Mac guy, so that's the camp that I'm in. Right? And I'm gonna

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,400
 put them on my computer and I get it. And I'm in community with a bunch of

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,360
 software engineers and they're like, and I'm trying to do it. I'm like, "Hey man, it

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,800
 won't work. You know, I know I'm stupid. Come over and help me." And they're like,

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,880
 "No, no, no. This is incompatible with your Mac. No, we're going to have to do some

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,560
 things to it to make it compatible. We're gonna have to reprogram it, right, if you

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,840
 will, so that it can be compatible for your Mac." It's interesting that the two

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,960
 machines, they do very, very similar things, but in ways, in lots of ways,

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,960
 they're really, really incompatible. And isn't that true of man and woman? That

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,480
 God made man and God made woman. And they exist for a really, really similar

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,040
 purpose, but in so many ways, they're incompatible. And they have different

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,840
 hardware, that's the external, right? And then different software, that's the

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,240
 internal. They think different and feel different and emote different. They are

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:29,400
 altogether different. And you can only even look at the physical, the hardware,

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,080
 if you will, and realize that these two were made to be compatible. But something

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,200
 has gone wrong. Something has gone tragically wrong. We're not getting

32
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,620
 better at this idea of relationships. I don't know if you realize this. We are

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,040
 getting a whole lot worse with the progression of time. We're getting so

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,080
 much worse at this, almost arrogantly, almost arrogantly, like, "No, we can we can

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,240
 do whatever we want, and we've got it all figured out." And no, no, the divorce rate

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:07,480
 skyrocketing at over half. That's crazy that people would plan their entire life

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,280
 to spend the rest of their lives with one person, and over half of them would

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,200
 get it wrong. It's actually much more than half, because the marriage

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,680
 satisfaction rate is tragically low, as the majority, the vast majority of

40
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,520
 marriages fail miserably, either by divorce or undivorced, right? Just

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:35,440
 roommates or open marriages. And so there it seems as though we're incompatible.

42
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:44,200
 And so tonight we're talking about sex by design, really sexes by design. Just

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,040
 this fact that we have a manufacturer, one who made us, and he has a desire. And

44
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,160
 to know how we work the best, we have to return to the manufacturer and say, "Hey,

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:04,480
 how did you make us? What is your purpose?" Because those who live according to how

46
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,280
 He created them to be get it right, all right? Whether they're believers or not,

47
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,560
 those who live according to the way that He created us, those who understand His

48
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,200
 intentions or unknowingly they live according to His intentions, those are

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:28,720
 the ones who get it right. And tonight I want that to be you. And so it's

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
 no confusing issue that we get this wrong. I mean, it's just the

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,960
 reality. Think about your breakups and heartbreak and really every relationship

52
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,760
 you have ever been in that you're not in anymore because it ended. Something went

53
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,880
 wrong. And there's this idea right now that gender doesn't matter that's being

54
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,200
 populated by our culture. And I think the church kind of raises up and says, "Yes it

55
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:57,320
 does!" But I don't really know why. Now I think it really matters, but I'm not sure

56
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:04,640
 how to explain that. And so we seem not only incompatible, we seem to be getting

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,200
 less and less compatible. And so we're starting this series tonight, just this

58
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,440
 battle of the sexes, which is the designers plan for man, woman, sex, dating,

59
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,800
 and relationships. And so to preview tonight, we're going to look at God's

60
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,480
 design in the beginning, what went wrong and the implications of what went wrong,

61
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,760
 and what we should do now as you leave here and as you consider interacting

62
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,280
 with the opposite sex. What should we do now? What was God's original intention

63
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,120
 for us? We're going to be in Genesis, which just is a book that means

64
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,840
 "the beginning." So we're gonna be in Genesis 1, 2, and 3. So pray for clarity

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,000
 and brevity tonight as we go through Genesis chapters 1, 2, and 3. And we just

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,280
 go back to this book of origin, if you will, that says where we come from and

67
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,760
 why we were created. We'll start in Genesis chapter 1, verse 26. "Then God

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,920
 said, 'Let us," that's the Trinity, "make mankind in our," Trinity, "image, in our

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,560
 likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky,

70
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,760
 over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the

71
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,160
 creatures that move along the ground.' So God created mankind," that's us, "in His

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:26,240
 own image. In the image of God He created them, male and female He created them. God

73
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,120
 blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number. Fill the

74
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,200
 earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and

75
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,320
 over every living creature that moves on the ground.'" My first point this evening is

76
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,760
 that we were created opposites to complete. That we were made male and

77
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,040
 female to complete. That God could have made all men, He could have made all

78
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,880
 women, He could have done this deal however He wanted to. He could have

79
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,400
 stopped at dogs, okay? He could have stopped at rhinoceroses or whatever or

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,800
 not made anything, but by design, very intentionally, He made them male and

81
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,760
 female in the beginning. That we were created opposites to complete. And that

82
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,280
 there's this profound reality in this text that we are made in God's image.

83
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,680
 This is the imago Dei. What does it mean that we were made in God's image? Here's

84
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,960
 what it means simply put. That you have value. That you have value. That you were

85
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:39,600
 made by God for God. Okay, this thing has value because it's Apple. Has value

86
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,920
 because it's Dell. You have value because you're God's. What's your brand? God's. Do

87
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,360
 you have less value because you were hurt in that relationship? Do you have

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
 less value because what happened to you? Do you have less value because you, I

89
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,280
 don't care if you live in the projects or the park cities, your value is the

90
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,080
 same because you were made by God. He made you intentionally. He has this plan

91
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,920
 and this purpose for you. And so we were made not only by God, but to represent

92
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,880
 God. And so God is represented as masculine, of course. We know that God is

93
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,840
 referred to as He. And so we know, we see the metaphors in the scripture to

94
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,800
 describe Him as husband and father and king and warrior. But God is also

95
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,080
 represented as feminine in the scripture. As a mother giving birth. As a nursing

96
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,680
 mother caring for her infant. As a hen with chicks under her wings caring for

97
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,080
 and protecting them. And so your value doesn't come from your Facebook status,

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:49,200
 single or married. Your value comes because you are an image bearer of the

99
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,000
 creator of the universe. You were made, like I don't know if you've known your

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,400
 purpose your entire life, but you were made to represent Him. And when you do so

101
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,520
 you are fully alive. And when you miss it, you are missing the calling on your life.

102
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,040
 We see in this text the first Great Commission. You've heard that term

103
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,640
 probably there in Matthew. But here we have the first Great Commission. He says

104
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,680
 "Be fruitful and increase in number. Fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the

105
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,480
 fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,400
 moves on the ground." What does it mean to be an image bearer of God? It means that

107
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:29,120
 you were created to rule. That you were created as ruler over the earth. This is

108
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,400
 so important that God made little gods to rule over the earth. Or better said

109
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,600
 image bearers of the one true God to rule over the earth. And so we're created

110
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,720
 as opposites, male and female, to work together to bring order in this place.

111
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
 That's important, to bring order into this place. Not made to war against each

112
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,240
 other but to work together. Together we are made like God, for God, by God, to

113
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,440
 represent God in filling and forming the earth. Together we are made like God, for

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,840
 God, by God, to represent God in filling and forming, shaping, making in the earth.

115
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,880
 This is your purpose. Made distinctly male and female. Different. Are we

116
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,840
 different, male and female? Are we different? I can tell you from a young

117
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,560
 age you can observe these differences. I have two daughters and my son.

118
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,400
 My daughters, they have this pink wand with a big star on it that

119
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,320
 lights up and makes this little twinkling noise. They kind of walk

120
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,760
 around and they're like, you know, they're doing this. "Oh, I can turn on the

121
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,200
 candles. Look, Daddy, it's magic." They're kind of using this one. My

122
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,880
 17-month-old son gets it and it becomes a weapon of mass destruction.

123
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,040
 He's like, "Wham! Wham!" He's just sitting there like banging the couch like

124
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,960
 it's a hammer or a broadsword swinging it at him. I'm ducking and he's swinging it at

125
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:06,880
 my head. They're just different. I mean, even at that really, really, really

126
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,400
 early age. That's one silly example but I see their differences in so many

127
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:20,640
 ways. How are they different? Genesis 2 now, verse 15. "The Lord God took the man

128
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,920
 and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." So

129
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,040
 Genesis 2 is really an expounding of the parenthetical Genesis 1. So Genesis 1,

130
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,360
 we have this summary and then Genesis 2 says, "Hey, let me show you how it all

131
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,200
 went down." "And the Lord God commanded the man, 'You are free to

132
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,440
 eat from any tree in the Garden, but you must not eat from the tree of the

133
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,640
 knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.'"

134
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,920
 The Lord God said. And so all up into this point, he's like, "He made it. It was good.

135
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,480
 He made it. It was good. He made it. It was good. He said it. He said it. It was and

136
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,400
 it was good. He said it. It was and it was good." This is the rhythm we see. "He said it.

137
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,800
 It was and it was good." And he's God. And so you think everything's perfect in the

138
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,280
 Garden of Eden. It is paradise, right? There's nothing wrong. And then God,

139
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,160
 Creator of the heavens and the earth, says, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There's something wrong." He says this.

140
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:17,680
 It's really odd. He says, "It is not good." Now, "It is not good for the man to be

141
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,800
 alone. I will make a helper suitable for him." Now the Lord God had formed out of

142
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,840
 the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to

143
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,320
 the man. This is just kind of a parenthetical statement showing you

144
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,720
 everything that's happened up to this point. He brought them to the man to see

145
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,040
 what he would name them and whatever the man called each living creature, that was

146
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,120
 its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky, and

147
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,280
 the wild animals. We see the man bringing order to this place. God says, "Hey, you are

148
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,920
 there. You are a ruler made in my image to rule. Bring order to this place." This is

149
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,360
 the biblical definition of masculinity.

150
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:14,120
 To bench press 300 pounds? Nope. To love football? Nope. To be ripped up? Nope. To fight? Nope.

151
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,120
 To spit? Nope. The biblical definition of masculinity is to bring order

152
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,560
 through work and care. That is what it means to be fully a man, to bring order

153
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,280
 through work and care. Man, I hope you hear that. So did Adam like football or

154
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:41,120
 play the harp? We don't know. We know he didn't like football, let's be honest.

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,440
 It doesn't matter to bring order through work and care. But for Adam, no suitable,

156
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,960
 circle that word suitable, helper, circle that word helper, was formed. So the Lord

157
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,920
 God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took

158
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,840
 one of his ribs, one of the man's ribs, and then closed up the place with flesh.

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,440
 Then the Lord made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man. He brought

160
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,560
 her to the man. This is not figurative. It's not poetry. This is actually how it

161
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,480
 went down. Picture Adam. He's sleeping. God, the Creator, grabs his rib and makes

162
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,720
 woman from him. This literally happened in the garden. It says that Eve is

163
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,320
 a suitable. What does that word suitable mean? It doesn't translate well in

164
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,360
 English. It means as the opposite of. Eve was made as the opposite of. You ever

165
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,560
 heard opposites attract? It's biblical. It's biblical. Opposites do indeed. I've

166
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,720
 done many, many weddings, and usually they are very, very different people that come

167
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,120
 together. I'm like, "Oh, you guys are gonna be sanctified. They're getting along, okay?"

168
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:59,560
 Opposites attract. They also later attack. Opposites attract, and later they attack.

169
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,520
 True story. Eve is made according to the opposite of Adam. Then that

170
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,880
 other word is, she's not just suitable, she's a helper. That's the word azer.

171
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,160
 Helper. The biblical definition of femininity is this, ability to

172
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,720
 come alongside and help. Listen to this part. A necessary compliment.

173
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,200
 Ability to come alongside and help. A necessary compliment. Anybody upset by

174
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,440
 that? If I read it and I was a woman, I'm like, "Helper? What am I, an assistant?"

175
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,320
 Stay with me. There's a couple ways to think about helper.

176
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,840
 We've got to clarify this. This is important. You could think like

177
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,280
 Santa's little helper. Like there's Santa, and he needs all these helpers.

178
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,680
 Little helpers. Now, if you will, picture for me a little car

179
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,760
 stuck in some mud, and it needs help. It needs a big monster truck to come and

180
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:05,640
 pull him out of that. Helper. Helper can both be demeaning, if you will,

181
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,960
 but it can also be a huge compliment. I think personally it's funny. It says that

182
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:18,360
 us men, we need help. Amen? Try to hold down the applause.

183
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,600
 It says men, we need help. You know who is called helper in the

184
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:32,560
 Old Testament? The same word? God. This same word is used most often to describe

185
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,160
 two things, 21 times in the Old Testament, to describe warrior and to describe God.

186
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,160
 His relationship with Israel. He was there. "I lift my eyes to the hills.

187
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,080
 Where does my azer come from? Where does my help come from? God, I need you."

188
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,080
 The Holy Spirit is our helper. This is the word that is given to the women.

189
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:06,720
 Women, you are a helper. It's beautiful. It's really beautiful.

190
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,680
 Femininity is the ability to come alongside and help a necessary compliment.

191
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,280
 It says that Eve is made from Adam's side. I love this from Matthew Henry's commentary.

192
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,200
 I just want to read it to you. "Not made out of his head to top him, not

193
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,680
 made out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with

194
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,000
 him under his arm to be protected and near his heart to be beloved."

195
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,360
 Women, let me tell you this. You are a complete mystery to us.

196
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,520
 You just are, man. We don't understand you.

197
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,600
 We think we do. Right when we're like, "I get women."

198
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
 I've had some men tell me that. "I really understand women."

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,440
 I'm like, "That's cute, buddy. That's really cute."

200
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,640
 You're a mystery to us. I can just tell you that most of the men in

201
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,400
 the room remember that time when that girl they were attracted to came up and just said,

202
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:13,240
 "Hey, can I help you with that?" "No. Yes. Maybe. No. Sure."

203
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:24,840
 I remember when I met Monica, she just was like, you know, I just was like, "Whoa."

204
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:33,600
 She would start to come over and we would start to hang out.

205
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,720
 She would come over sometimes when I wasn't there and my roommates would let her in.

206
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,040
 My room was like a tornado. It was just like, you know, it needed that

207
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,880
 yellow tape around it. It was really bad.

208
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,560
 There was stuff growing in there. She would tell you that.

209
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,640
 It's true. She would just go in there and she would bring

210
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,520
 order to it. She would put stuff where it goes.

211
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,440
 I would walk in and I was like, "I didn't even know that had a place to go.

212
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
 You created a place for that to go. I didn't even know that was possible."

213
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,860
 It was just like I saw how necessary it was for us to spend time together so I would have

214
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:15,920
 a better understanding of who I was created to be as a man to bring order and needing

215
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,160
 help with that. Needing help.

216
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,780
 Not someone to do it for me. Not just someone to do it for me.

217
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,460
 Someone to show me how necessary it was. I want you to watch what happens next.

218
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,560
 The man said, ready, in quotes, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

219
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,440
 She shall be called woman for she was taken out of man."

220
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,860
 This is in quotes. In the Hebrew, this is actually a song.

221
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:47,000
 So you can just see Adam, like he wakes up from this dream and he looks and he's like,

222
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,880
 "Her eyes, her eyes." I mean he's just Bruno Mars, right?

223
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,120
 He's going off on it. He's like, "Oh, this is good. You did good,

224
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,440
 God. Well done." His first words are song.

225
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,680
 There they are. They're getting along.

226
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,780
 Man and woman. That is why man leaves his father.

227
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:15,480
 That is why man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife and they indeed

228
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,240
 become one flesh. Adam and his wife were both naked.

229
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,520
 Why would God put this in the scripture? Listen.

230
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,080
 Why would he go to such great lengths to preserve this one little line?

231
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:33,540
 Adam and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame.

232
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,800
 They felt no shame. They were made to complete, not compete.

233
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:46,040
 And there they are and there's no shame. They were naked and unashamed.

234
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,480
 No insecurities. No, "Do I look fat in these jeans?"

235
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,880
 No jeans, you know. Just there.

236
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,120
 They were safe. Like some of you, that's the longing of your

237
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,560
 heart. "I just want to be in a relationship and I

238
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,000
 just want to be safe." There's a safety in the Garden of Eden right

239
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 now that is incomprehensible to us. We can't even imagine it in our wildest dreams

240
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,220
 that they coexisted and just realized their completion of each other.

241
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:27,260
 How much they are both necessary. Just this reality and they're there and there's

242
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,160
 no shame. They're unashamed.

243
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,600
 And so Eve is not leveraging her sex appeal for power over Adam.

244
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,080
 Adam's not domineering over Eve. They're just there and they're just safe.

245
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,900
 And so men were created to bring order through work and care.

246
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,440
 Women created to help in that purpose as a necessary complement.

247
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,420
 Together they fill and form the earth. They are unashamed and loving and trusting

248
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,520
 each other in right relationship with each other and more importantly in right relationship

249
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,120
 with God. They walk with God.

250
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,160
 They're in the Garden and they get to walk with the Creator.

251
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,280
 The heavens and the earth, they get to talk with Him and commune with Him.

252
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,920
 So what went wrong? Number two, we become opponents who compete.

253
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,840
 We become opponents who compete. The serpent comes up to Eve.

254
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,040
 This is how this goes down. And says, "Hey, you can eat from the tree

255
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,280
 that God told you not to eat from. If you eat from it, you will be like God."

256
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
 That's confusing because she was already like God.

257
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,440
 She was made in God's image to be like God, by God, for God, to be like God.

258
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,840
 The serpent is offering her a shortcut to be like God without God.

259
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,660
 That is still the lie of the world. That you can be like God without God.

260
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,460
 It will never, ever, ever work. See, when you walk with God, you become like

261
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,880
 God. When you spend time with God, you become like

262
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,800
 God. They were walking with God, but the serpent

263
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,480
 says, "Hey, you don't need to walk with God. Just eat from this.

264
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:05,680
 Just disobey God, and you will be like Him." Then the eyes of both of them were opened,

265
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,080
 and they realized they were naked, so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings

266
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,720
 for themselves. All of the sudden, with this one fracture in

267
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200
 existence in the universe, everything is undone in a moment.

268
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,860
 And now all relationships are broken. The no shame, that no shame part, it's undone.

269
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,060
 And now women feel insecure, and then they overcompensate by using their bodies and flaunting

270
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,940
 their bodies as a tool. Men do the same thing now.

271
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,940
 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord as he was walking in the garden

272
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,460
 in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden.

273
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,200
 But the Lord God called to the man, "Where are you?"

274
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,400
 Their relationship with God is fractured. Here's what that means.

275
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,760
 They don't trust Him. In one moment, the one who created them and

276
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,600
 was good to them, they don't trust Him. You want better relationships?

277
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,780
 You can have 100% better relationships simply by trusting God.

278
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,400
 What was undone in the fall is that we no longer trust God.

279
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,660
 He answered, Adam answers, "I heard you in the garden.

280
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,820
 I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." And he said, "Who told you you were naked?

281
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,500
 Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"

282
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,700
 The man said, "The woman you put here with me, she gave me some fruit from the tree,

283
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,660
 and I ate it." Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What

284
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,060
 is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me,

285
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,180
 and I ate it." What's happening?

286
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,220
 Blame shifting. And it still happens.

287
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,340
 This still happens today. No, no, I'm like this because of what happened

288
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:52,500
 to me. I'll meet with someone who got a divorce,

289
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,220
 and they're like, "Yeah, you wouldn't believe. My scumbag husband cheated on me."

290
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,700
 I'm like, "The man that you chose out of all men on the face of the planet that you said,

291
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,860
 'This is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with,' that man cheated on you?"

292
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,900
 And I'm not trying to be merciless right now. I know that sometimes maybe it's a true surprise.

293
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,780
 Maybe his heart changed. I get it. That girl, you wouldn't believe what she

294
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,980
 did. The girl you chose, of all the girls, you

295
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,100
 chose crazy, you got crazy. You said, "Hey, I want crazy."

296
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,940
 And then you're surprised, "I can't believe she was crazy."

297
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,780
 Everybody would say, "She's crazy. That girl's crazy."

298
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:42,540
 Check this out. We're always pointing, "This is why I'm the

299
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,060
 way I am." And I want to say this to some of you, and

300
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,420
 I really want you to hear me, and this is important.

301
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,540
 If you're angry right now, I want you to hear this.

302
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,780
 Some of you, some things have happened to you that were beyond you.

303
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:04,540
 Abuse, rape, physical, verbal, bad things happened to you.

304
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:12,860
 A guy was just really, really good at pretending, and then he got bad things.

305
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,980
 And you're moving through life, and you're blaming, and you're saying, "Hey, that's the

306
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,780
 reason I am." And I want you to know that evil wins in

307
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,940
 that. I changed her.

308
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,420
 The wicked one says, "Yeah, see, she's damaged goods."

309
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,100
 And you're not. And so the question is, if I've been raped,

310
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,140
 if I've been abused, is there any chance that I would have a healthy marriage or a healthy

311
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,860
 sexual relationship? And the answer is a resounding, loud, "Yes."

312
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,620
 My God is so big. But there's a big asterisk to it.

313
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,220
 You have to start healing. And not going through life, finding identity

314
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,220
 in that, "I'm damaged. I hate men. I can't trust.

315
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,780
 I just don't trust anyone." But actually starting to say, "God, I trust

316
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,340
 you, and I want to be led by your spirit, and I want to begin to heal from that which

317
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,940
 happened to me. God, I trust you.

318
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:16,060
 You have to begin to heal." To the woman, he said, "I will make your pains

319
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,940
 in childbearing very severe." I read that, and wow.

320
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,800
 "With painful labor, you will give birth to children.

321
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,140
 Your desire will be for your husband." And so femininity in a moment is compromised.

322
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,380
 Fulfilling the earth just became difficult. Helping the man just became difficult.

323
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,300
 Where do I get helping the man? It says, "Your desire will be for your husband."

324
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,460
 I read that, and I'm like, "That's good news." Praise God for the fall.

325
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,380
 Now Monica's going to desire a husband. That's not what it means.

326
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:53,540
 Desire there in the Hebrew is actually translated "desire to control."

327
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,060
 Desire to master. We only see this word three times in the Old

328
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,040
 Testament. It's a strange word, and we see it just one

329
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,380
 chapter later in Genesis 4, verse 7. It says, "Sin is crouching at your door."

330
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,860
 God speaking to Cain. "It desires," same word, "to have you.

331
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,560
 It desires to master you, but you must rule over it."

332
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,260
 When it says, "Her desire will be for her husband," the result of the fall is now Eve

333
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:23,140
 desires to control her husband. This is the effect of the fall.

334
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:30,140
 Any women here struggle with control? Don't raise your hand.

335
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,700
 Yes. Yes.

336
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,980
 We sure do. You sure do.

337
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,740
 I shouldn't say we. They sure do.

338
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,580
 But there's some implications in this for single women.

339
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:49,580
 This is an illustration. I'm just hot.

340
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,860
 There's some implications in here for single women.

341
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,500
 This is why you like the guy that doesn't pay you attention.

342
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,620
 Because of the fall, this is why games work. I'm not telling you to play games.

343
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,860
 Romans 12 says, "Love must be sincere." You should not play games.

344
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,780
 It is not Christ-like to play games. But I'm telling you, because of the fall,

345
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,260
 games work. You begin to like the guy who doesn't pay

346
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,080
 attention to you because you want to master the situation.

347
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,220
 You want to control it. And the guy that loves you and cares for

348
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,100
 you and buys you all the wonderful things and chocolates and flowers on Valentine's

349
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,340
 Day, you're like, "Yeah, I know. He's kind of always there, but I don't know.

350
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,860
 We're just friends." Right?

351
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,660
 And it's so frustrating. Right?

352
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,300
 Amen, guys? That's because of the fall.

353
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,940
 That's because of sin. Okay?

354
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,340
 That's all I'm saying. And so some of you, you're like, yeah, you're

355
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,640
 going around and you've just kind of got this chip on your shoulder and you're like, you

356
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,440
 know, like, "Help her. Like, whatever. Hey, listen, I don't need a man. Right?

357
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,680
 I can do whatever I want, and I don't need somebody to come around me and to help me.

358
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,160
 I'm going to help some. He can help me." Right?

359
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,360
 You know, that's cool. You don't win.

360
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,880
 That attitude is going to keep you single. I'm just, I'm trying to love you here.

361
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,080
 Okay? That attitude is going to keep you single.

362
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,320
 Or there's two results. I've seen them.

363
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,780
 Or you marry a very, very, very passive man. Those are the two results.

364
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,540
 You stay single or you marry a very, very, very passive man.

365
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,820
 And you're like, "I can do anything. Anything he can do, I can."

366
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,140
 You might be right. Maybe you can, but should you?

367
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:37,900
 Or should you understand God's role for you? His intended purpose for you? Right?

368
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:47,140
 That He has this design for you.

369
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,600
 And He says, "And He," that's the man, "will rule over you."

370
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,020
 What that is saying now is that masculinity is compromised.

371
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,420
 He doesn't bring order through care. He is domineering.

372
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,380
 That rule over you is not loving leadership. It's harsh domination.

373
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,760
 Okay? This is really broken now in us men.

374
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,420
 This reality that we just became very incompatible.

375
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,700
 Just imagine, the woman wants to control the man,

376
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,140
 and the man wants to dominate the woman. That doesn't work.

377
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,900
 52% divorce rate. It doesn't work.

378
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,220
 Unless we conform to the image and character of Jesus, right?

379
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:33,780
 Unless we pursue an understanding of how our manufacturer made us.

380
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,940
 It doesn't work.

381
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,180
 So think of every relationship you've been in.

382
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,800
 Think of your parents' relationships, your friends' relationships.

383
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,940
 Think about the way that sitcoms play this out.

384
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,680
 It's broken because of the fall.

385
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,200
 To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife

386
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,160
 and ate the fruit of the tree about which I commanded you,

387
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,280
 you must not eat from it. Cursed is the ground because of you.

388
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,400
 Through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.

389
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,340
 It will produce thorns and thistles for you,

390
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,000
 and you will eat from the plants of the field.

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,480
 By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food

392
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,860
 until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken,

393
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,460
 for dust you are, and to dust you will return."

394
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,840
 And so man finds identity now in futile labor that never ceases to exist.

395
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,120
 The man continues to find his identity in what he does for a living,

396
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,000
 and it never goes away.

397
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,520
 And he spends his entire life in that. We see this.

398
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,360
 This is profound results of the fall that happened in the garden

399
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,840
 that still exists today in all of us, both man and woman.

400
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,280
 And so Adam named his wife Eve because she would become the mother of all the living.

401
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,920
 And so now making disciples through procreation,

402
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,960
 that first great commission, is now complicated.

403
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,840
 And as a father of three kids, trust me, it's complicated.

404
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,480
 At the fall all relationships were fractured.

405
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,520
 Relationships with each other, male and female,

406
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,320
 and relationships with God. We desperately need a Savior.

407
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,720
 We need someone to come and save us and mend these relationships

408
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,680
 and bridge these relationships.

409
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:12,040
 And as we trust in Him and Him alone, right, are these relationships mended

410
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:18,800
 as we understand how we were designed, how we were manufactured to coexist.

411
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,000
 And so my third and final point is that servants complete

412
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,020
 while the selfish compete.

413
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,320
 The selfish continue to compete with each other,

414
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:33,120
 but those who serve and only those who serve are able to complete each other.

415
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,080
 And so who is selfish? Who's selfish out there?

416
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,520
 People with an agenda. Men wanting sex.

417
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,320
 Men wanting to abuse women and use their bodies.

418
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,880
 They have a selfish agenda. They will always compete.

419
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,640
 Women who want men, and I don't mean want men like, you know,

420
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,080
 wanting a husband in general. I mean want to find identity in men.

421
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,400
 They need a man in their life. They're not comfortable alone.

422
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,200
 They desperately need the attention of a man.

423
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,920
 They are selfish. People who are desperately wanting to domineer

424
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,320
 or lead or control are selfish.

425
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,920
 People wanting to push their gender agenda, right, it's selfish.

426
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,480
 Do nothing out of selfish ambition.

427
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,560
 But Jesus, our Savior, Jesus Christ was selfless.

428
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,240
 He modeled this perfectly. We see this in Philippians 2.

429
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,040
 Write these down. I want you to read them on your own.

430
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,320
 Philippians 2, Mark chapter 10, Ephesians 5,

431
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,200
 the husband is the head of the wife.

432
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,360
 And we're like, oh yeah, the husband is the leader.

433
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,400
 I don't know if you read that verse. It says,

434
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,000
 "As Christ is the head of the church and gave himself for her,

435
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,240
 serving her ultimately with his all."

436
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:51,960
 That this idea that the man should be the chief servant. Servant.

437
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,600
 Monica and I went into premarital counseling.

438
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,880
 We were a mess. We were new Christians.

439
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,600
 And we met with this guy.

440
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
 And we were happy. We were getting married.

441
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,320
 That was cool.

442
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,760
 He was sitting there giving us advice.

443
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,080
 And I was just kind of over it.

444
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,200
 I remember he said this thing.

445
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,800
 He just said, "Hey, you guys, stop pursuing each other

446
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,720
 and start pursuing the Lord together."

447
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,480
 I was like, well, that's cute, man.

448
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,840
 Did you read that preacher handbook?

449
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,880
 That's really neat. Let me get this straight.

450
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,160
 He said, "Stop pursuing each other

451
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,520
 and start pursuing God together."

452
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
 Okay.

453
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,680
 And I look back on our relationship,

454
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,520
 which was a disaster.

455
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
 If you've been around here long,

456
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,240
 you know we were facing divorce year two.

457
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,920
 And now we've been together over a decade.

458
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,720
 And I'm like, that was totally prophetic.

459
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,280
 Like that's exactly what happened.

460
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,760
 When we stopped pursuing each other

461
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
 and we started pursuing God together,

462
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,720
 he changed everything.

463
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,000
 Here's what it looked like.

464
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,720
 I would constantly try to make Monica like me.

465
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,680
 Monica would constantly try to make me like her.

466
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,120
 But as we understood that we were Christians,

467
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
 that we had trusted in Christ

468
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,280
 and the Holy Spirit had come in our lives,

469
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,400
 what I mean by that is that we had trusted in Christ

470
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,000
 for the forgiveness of our sins,

471
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,760
 that we were gonna be with God forever.

472
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,680
 We knew that.

473
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,400
 And the Holy Spirit, God's Spirit,

474
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000
 came to live in our lives.

475
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,960
 I didn't need to change her anymore.

476
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,320
 God was changing her.

477
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,640
 He was changing her to make her like him.

478
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,840
 And she saw his work in my life too,

479
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,680
 that she didn't need to change me anymore,

480
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,160
 that God was changing me.

481
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,160
 God was changing me to be like him.

482
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,880
 And as we began to trust that,

483
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,920
 instead of competing with each other,

484
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,480
 but completing each other,

485
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,320
 it became a really beautiful thing.

486
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,160
 It became a really, really incredible thing in our marriage.

487
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,220
 It saved our marriage, that advice.

488
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,260
 And so let me give it to you again.

489
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,560
 Stop pursuing each other

490
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,480
 and start pursuing the Lord together.

491
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,800
 Start serving God, the creator, together.

492
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,560
 See, we were created, male and female,

493
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,800
 to walk with God together in the garden.

494
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,560
 And when you walk with God, you learn his desires,

495
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,280
 his desires for us and how we love and respect each other.

496
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,200
 This is what is playing out,

497
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,340
 as we were male and female, distinct.

498
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,360
 And so the culture is coming at you right now

499
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,360
 with another agenda, saying that gender doesn't matter,

500
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,640
 that you should be what you feel.

501
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,720
 And so let me tell you this.

502
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,800
 I can take this computer and I can change the software.

503
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,520
 I can take this computer and I can change the software on it

504
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,720
 but it's still a Mac 'cause it was made a Mac.

505
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,480
 And so what is on it, what's inside,

506
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,240
 doesn't change its identity.

507
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,880
 And this is the progression of transgender.

508
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,820
 If you're here and you heard that word,

509
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,120
 I've been asking people, do you know what transgender means?

510
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,400
 People don't know what that means.

511
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400
 I've heard homosexual, I've heard hermaphrodite.

512
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,080
 Transgender simply means that you feel

513
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,000
 different than you are.

514
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 That's all it means.

515
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,120
 It has nothing to do with your sexual orientation.

516
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,640
 It doesn't have anything to do

517
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,880
 with whether you like men or women.

518
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,880
 It just says, I'm created a man, I have all man parts,

519
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,560
 but I identify more as a woman.

520
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,000
 And so what's happening in places like Philadelphia

521
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,600
 is there's transgender restrooms

522
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,320
 and they're comparing this to civil rights

523
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,860
 and say, well, if you feel like a woman,

524
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,480
 even though you're a man and you may be attracted to women,

525
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,280
 you should be able to go to the women's restroom.

526
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,440
 And this is happening in kindergarten.

527
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,080
 Kindergarteners are told, hey, boys,

528
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,840
 you can go in the girls' restroom if you feel like it.

529
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,760
 And it's important that we educate ourself on this

530
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,400
 so that we can come with love as we address these issues

531
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,440
 that we're educated and know what is going on around us.

532
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,000
 You were born male or female.

533
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,680
 There was a guy that said, am I a man

534
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,760
 just because I have a penis?

535
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,120
 Simply put, yes.

536
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,840
 Yes.

537
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
 Yes, you are.

538
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,720
 And so the message of culture is to be

539
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,840
 whoever you feel like,

540
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 that your emotions define your sex.

541
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
 We're so rebellious that we reject

542
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,320
 the very way we were created.

543
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,200
 And so what I want you to do tonight

544
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,560
 is understand who the Lord made you to be, right?

545
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,880
 And stop placing blame on your past

546
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,160
 and what has happened to you

547
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,800
 and begin to heal through those experiences

548
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,400
 so that you can live as God made you to be,

549
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,520
 understanding who he's intended you to be.

550
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,660
 And I understand that the world hates change,

551
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,480
 but to grow up means to change.

552
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,760
 To mature spiritually means to change.

553
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,920
 Sanctification means change.

554
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,160
 And so we can stop saying, like,

555
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,200
 oh, I don't want to change.

556
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,040
 Like, change is bad.

557
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,160
 Change is not bad.

558
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,240
 Change is synonymous with maturity.

559
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
 It means change.

560
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,000
 And so I want to talk to you for a second.

561
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,360
 I want to talk to you for a second.

562
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,080
 I don't want to tell you that if you're here

563
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,960
 and you're single,

564
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,720
 and you're waking up at two in the morning,

565
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,280
 and you hate the fact that you're single

566
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,920
 and you wish you had some outlet of release,

567
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,680
 but you're waging war with that desire

568
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
 because you believe God calls you to,

569
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,160
 I want you to know I'm so proud of you.

570
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,400
 I'm so proud of you.

571
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,040
 And if you're here and you're a girl,

572
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,540
 and you refuse to get a guy with your body,

573
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,240
 knowing that that's a shortcut,

574
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,080
 and knowing that you can get his attention with your body,

575
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,560
 but you say, I won't because I know it offends my creator,

576
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,080
 I'm so proud of you.

577
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,380
 And if you're here and you're a man,

578
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,740
 and you realize that your natural urge

579
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,700
 is to dominate and to be forceful,

580
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,640
 but you're yielding to his spirit at work inside you

581
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,240
 to make you quick to listen and slow to speak

582
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,740
 and slow to become angry,

583
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,820
 and conforming to the image and the character of Jesus

584
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,540
 to be soft and gentle and compassionate,

585
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,320
 I'm so proud of you.

586
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,120
 And if you're here and you've been hurt,

587
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,800
 like something awful and unspeakable has happened to you,

588
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,360
 or maybe you did something,

589
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,520
 and just a moment of naivety,

590
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,640
 you thought, hey, this is the only way,

591
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,120
 and so you pursue a solution that is outside

592
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,240
 of God's design, and you know that it has impacted

593
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,000
 your life, but you are seeking healing,

594
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,620
 and you want to be restored,

595
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,960
 I'm so proud of you.

596
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
 I'm so proud of you.

597
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,600
 And you're here, and you struggle

598
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,640
 with same-sex attraction, you identify as gay,

599
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,080
 and the world is saying, it's okay,

600
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,000
 it's not a struggle, it's offensive

601
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,680
 that he said that's a struggle.

602
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,580
 And you say, but I think that's not God's best for me.

603
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,360
 And so I will pursue healing in that,

604
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,000
 or I will pursue celibacy in that.

605
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,760
 I'm so proud of you.

606
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,240
 And if you're here, and you're a man,

607
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,560
 and you identify as a woman,

608
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,000
 or you're a woman, and you identify as a man,

609
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,020
 but you think, you know what, I don't know

610
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,680
 that this is God's best for me,

611
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,500
 so I want to understand a biblical idea

612
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,520
 of masculinity or femininity, a biblical idea,

613
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,700
 and you begin to educate yourself to that,

614
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,840
 and yield to his spirit at work in your life,

615
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,380
 so that you would grow towards that.

616
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,380
 I'm so proud of you, I'm so glad you're here.

617
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,720
 I'm so glad we are worshiping

618
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,740
 the creator of the universe together.

619
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,140
 I'm so proud of you.

620
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,500
 And if you're here, and you've just missed it,

621
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,380
 you just missed it, I want you to know I did too.

622
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,820
 Man, I missed it.

623
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,640
 There's a wake of destruction behind me relationally.

624
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,900
 10 years of marriage, I'm still comforting

625
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,460
 and consoling my wife from terrible things

626
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,220
 and terrible ways I've treated her.

627
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,580
 I'm looking at past relationships,

628
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,220
 and realizing there's lots of baggage there

629
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,060
 in my life and in dozens of girls

630
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,780
 that I've spent time with.

631
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,820
 I'm healing, but I've found freedom

632
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,900
 in a savior Jesus Christ,

633
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,420
 who came to this earth to die for my sins.

634
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,260
 He went in the grave, and he came out,

635
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,700
 he resurrected to new life, so that I can walk in that.

636
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,780
 And he's restoring me by his power at work in me,

637
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,060
 he's making me new.

638
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,840
 And that right now is available to you for free.

639
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,000
 Friends, porch goers, Dallas,

640
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,400
 you're created with a purpose, you have a purpose.

641
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,760
 And we work together, male and female.

642
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,640
 Even if we're not married, we serve the king together.

643
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,740
 What is the application for you?

644
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,640
 To be fully man, what does it mean to be fully a man?

645
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,520
 It means to serve in the church, in his body,

646
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,160
 to bring order and form that which is around you.

647
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,380
 What does it mean to be fully a woman?

648
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,200
 To partner with the men around you

649
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,680
 in serving in the body of Christ,

650
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,160
 forming and filling the earth through discipleship,

651
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,040
 using the gifts and the talents

652
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,120
 that the Lord has entrusted to you

653
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,120
 as an incredible woman who he made to serve him.

654
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,280
 When the fall happened, it's like we got a virus.

655
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,500
 It's like we got a virus.

656
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,680
 And something went really wrong

657
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,660
 and we just started fighting.

658
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,840
 We couldn't get along and our brain

659
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,960
 and our hearts were clouded and we didn't understand

660
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,680
 what it was like to give and to serve,

661
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,920
 we just wanted to take and to take and to take

662
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,820
 and to feel good and to seek pleasure.

663
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,360
 And when your machine gets a virus,

664
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,100
 what you gotta do is you gotta strip everything out of it.

665
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,800
 You gotta reprogram it.

666
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,960
 You gotta reprogram it.

667
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,280
 You gotta go back in there

668
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,040
 and install the original software.

669
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,480
 And so what we must do is educate ourselves

670
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,840
 to the creator, the manufacturer's original design

671
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:53,120
 so that we can understand fully how we can coexist,

672
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,420
 God willing, with one of the opposite sex

673
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,280
 for the rest of the rest of the rest.

674
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,360
 Isn't that a beautiful thing?

675
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,600
 That's a beautiful thing, man.

676
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,740
 That's my hope for you.

677
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,120
 That is my hope for you.

678
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,520
 Let me pray for us.

679
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:20,000
 Lord, thank you just for the beginning

680
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,740
 of the battle of the sexes.

681
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,180
 Father, as we can consider what is your desire

682
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,720
 for us as man and woman.

683
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,900
 Father, I pray for my friends here

684
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,140
 who are wrestling with some of what they heard tonight.

685
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,100
 It's very different than what their parents

686
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,420
 are telling them or their friends are telling them

687
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,620
 or their coworkers are telling them.

688
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,620
 And Lord, I pray that you would just give us the wisdom

689
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,520
 to return to your word and that your spirit

690
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,700
 would meet us there and make known to us the things of you.

691
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,560
 And Father, would you increase our ability

692
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,040
 to love those different than us?

693
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 Father, would you increase our ability

694
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,740
 to love those different than us?

695
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,780
 And Lord, I pray that you would use this series,

696
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,860
 just the rest of our gathering together,

697
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,760
 to continue to give us a vision

698
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,000
 of what it looks like today,

699
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,240
 continue to answer the biggest questions

700
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,160
 that we have around relationships with the opposite sex.

701
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,140
 Lord, we do love you and we sing love songs to you now.

702
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,500
 I think one of my fears is,

703
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,420
 I was just thinking about reflecting on this term,

704
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,400
 God's best.

705
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,380
 And I think some of us, we don't want God's best

706
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,620
 because we settle for good enough.

707
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,280
 Look at what is good enough.

708
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,340
 Or God's best is so like big and lofty.

709
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,340
 We're like, I don't know how to get God's best.

710
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,940
 So good enough is fine.

711
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,820
 I was preparing for this message yesterday at a restaurant

712
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,600
 and this girl, kind of across the restaurant,

713
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
 I guess, I'm on one wall, she's on the other wall,

714
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,680
 and she gets on her phone and she's very loud

715
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,880
 and very angry.

716
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,640
 And she's like, you won't believe what he did.

717
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,920
 Like, no, he comes in the room

718
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,680
 and shuts the door behind him and he's like,

719
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,960
 ooh, girl, you look good in that bathing suit.

720
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,800
 And I'm like, what?

721
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,000
 You can't say that to me.

722
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,280
 And I know 'cause I know he was with her the other day too.

723
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,240
 And he's been saying the same stuff to her

724
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,800
 and I just can't believe it.

725
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,480
 That went on for 25 minutes.

726
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,320
 I timed it.

727
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,800
 25 minutes.

728
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,580
 And just like, I can't, you know, I'm so angry.

729
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,620
 And so she hung up, I got up,

730
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,180
 pulled up a chair to her table,

731
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,280
 said, hey, I know, this is weird.

732
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,500
 (congregation laughing)

733
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,660
 I said, I said, I really didn't want to eavesdrop.

734
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,700
 She's like, but you did.

735
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,460
 And I was like, I was like, no, you were just loud, okay?

736
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,880
 (congregation laughing)

737
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,720
 And I said, here's the deal, man,

738
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,400
 we're starting this thing tomorrow.

739
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,120
 I don't know if you've heard of the porch, you know,

740
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,360
 we're starting this deal, Battle of the Sexes.

741
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,200
 Frankly, we're talking about everything

742
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,520
 that you were just talking about.

743
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,760
 And it's a great, it's a gathering for 20s and 30s.

744
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,120
 She's like, well, how do you know I'm not 18?

745
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,760
 I'm like, you just told your friend you were 23.

746
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,680
 I heard you.

747
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,720
 The whole restaurant heard you, you know?

748
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,120
 And I was like, I'd love for you to come.

749
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,040
 I said, do you have a faith?

750
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,440
 She's like, yeah, I was raised in the church.

751
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,520
 And I said, cool, do you know Jesus?

752
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,840
 You know he loves you.

753
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,260
 You know he's gone to great lengths

754
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,100
 to adopt you as his daughter.

755
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,080
 You know he has something better for you

756
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,560
 than that joker you were just talking about.

757
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,620
 She was like, yeah, I was mad.

758
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:22,920
 I was like, I could tell.

759
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,000
 (congregation laughing)

760
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,060
 I could tell.

761
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,920
 And he wants to restore you.

762
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,160
 So just pray for my friend, okay?

763
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,060
 I don't know if she's here, but pray for her.

764
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,820
 And let me just tell you, something's gone wrong,

765
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,740
 and God's best is better than you're good enough.

766
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,660
 And God's best is available to you.

767
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,380
 Tonight, as someone who has had

768
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,020
 much, much less than God's best,

769
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,660
 I can tell you from experience, it's available to you.

770
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,500
 Amen.

771
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:56,080
 (congregation applauding)

772
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,240
 (silence)
