[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.320]   What's up, Porch?
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.360]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.960]   [CHEERING]
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.160]   Hey, my name is Timothy Atik, and I'm
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.640]   one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark Community Church.
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240]   It is so great to get to be here with you tonight.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.440]   Definitely want to give a shout out to the PorchLive locations
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.680]   of Indianapolis, Boise, and Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.040]   Hope that all is well with you guys.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.360]   It's good to be right here with those in Dallas.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.640]   We are continuing the His and Hers series.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.880]   I want to start just by sharing with you that my wife and I,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.520]   we got married on October 14, 2006,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.200]   which means we are old people.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.040]   But we had an incredible wedding,
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.640]   and we had an incredible first year of marriage.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.760]   The beauty of getting married is that you
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.240]   get to invite all of your friends,
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.560]   and they are required to bring you a gift.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.340]   Not only that, you get to tell them what they have to buy you.
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.880]   You register, and they're obligated.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.800]   And it's a great thing.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.720]   And so a bunch of people gathered in Wichita Falls, Texas
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.720]   for our wedding.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.800]   And I'm half Palestinian, which means
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.120]   we had a Middle Eastern flair to our wedding.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.520]   So if you've ever seen movies or videos of Middle Eastern
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.880]   weddings with people flying in the air in chairs, that was us.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.720]   Catherine and I were in chairs, in the air.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.520]   The Arabs of the wedding circled up.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.080]   My cousin magically appeared with a drum.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.520]   He was playing the drum.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.600]   We were circled up.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.400]   It was dancing.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.040]   It was great.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.600]   My wife's little sister, who was in high school at the time,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.960]   brought her high school friends, and they all left saying,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   I want to marry an Egyptian.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.240]   I'm not Egyptian.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.040]   I hope that worked out for them.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.720]   But that's how good our wedding was.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.080]   And then after we got married, we
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.920]   went to St. Lucia for our honeymoon, which was amazing.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.680]   And then we just played really hard for our first year.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.600]   We went to Puerto Rico, and Italy, and California,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   and Florida.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.320]   And we played so hard that we gained the marriage 15.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.560]   If you remember the freshman 15 from college
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.880]   where you eat so much that you gain 15 pounds,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.560]   well, when I applied for life insurance
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.960]   during our first year of marriage,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.320]   I had to check the box for excessive weight gain
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.080]   because our first year of marriage was that good.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.480]   And even to this day, we just celebrate
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.360]   our 16-year anniversary.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.640]   I love marriage.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.840]   I love being married.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.760]   I have a great wife.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.080]   Catherine is amazing.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.540]   But here's what I haven't told you.
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.880]   I haven't told you about the time
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.400]   that my wife threw a blanket at me
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.560]   because she was so mad in our first fight
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.600]   about where we were going to spend the holidays.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.720]   That was a huge issue in our house.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.080]   I haven't told you about the fight
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.980]   that we had in public in the Austin airport
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.040]   as we were flying to San Diego for our one-year anniversary.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.800]   Like, I haven't told you about those times
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   because when you who are single,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.200]   which is the majority of you in this room
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.600]   or you're dating, when you think about marriage,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.200]   and statistics would say that marriage is important
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   to about 80 to 90% of you in the room,
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.360]   when you think about marriage,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.560]   most likely you only think about the good times.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.960]   Like, does anyone here dream about fighting
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.880]   with your future spouse?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.200]   Any girls, like, I just can't wait to fight with him.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.320]   It's gonna be amazing.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.120]   No one dreams of that day.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.800]   Anyone longing to get into marriage
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.880]   and then wish that you were no longer married,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.600]   anyone think about that?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.800]   Anyone dream about a day
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.480]   when you could feel stuck in your marriage
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.480]   or that you could be married and feel lonely?
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.980]   No, we don't think about that.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.240]   And so that's one of the reasons
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.400]   that we're doing this series, His and Hers,
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   because the reality is it's easy
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.200]   to find the wrong dating relationship
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.480]   that leads to the wrong marriage.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.280]   Our hope is that you'd find the right dating relationship
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.000]   that would lead to the right marriage.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.960]   And so the first week of this series,
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.880]   David just talked about three signs
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.120]   that you're not ready to date.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.840]   And then last week he gave us 10 keys
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.760]   to uncomplicating dating.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.320]   Tonight what I wanna do is I wanna give you six questions
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.800]   that will hopefully save your marriage
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.880]   before it ever begins.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.720]   That's my hope tonight.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.760]   So if you have a Bible,
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.160]   I wanna invite you to join me in the Song of Solomon,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.840]   the Song of Songs, chapter one.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   As you're turning there, if you're like,
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.680]   I don't know what he just said, okay?
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.040]   The Song of Songs is a book
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.960]   in the middle of the Old Testament of your Bible.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.840]   Don't be afraid to use the table of contents.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.680]   And the reason that we're turning there tonight
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   is that Song of Solomon is basically God's instruction manual
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.200]   for romantic love.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.160]   It is all about finding love,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.320]   making love, and maintaining love.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.160]   It gives us God's design for relationships
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.120]   between men and women.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.140]   And so if there's any place that we should look,
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.680]   we should look to the Song of Solomon
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.680]   because God hasn't just tossed us marriage
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.920]   and said, figure it out.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.000]   No, he actually gives us an instruction manual for it.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.080]   Now, I wanna be clear,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.800]   tonight isn't just a talk about marriage.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.480]   So if you are single, this talk is especially for you.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.680]   If you are dating, this talk is for you.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.080]   If you are engaged, this talk is for you.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.560]   I wanna give you six questions from the Song of Solomon
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.920]   that will save your marriage before it begins.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.320]   If you're looking with me at the Song of Solomon,
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.000]   we're gonna start in chapter one, verse one.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.960]   Now, if you've never read the book before,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.160]   what you need to know is that it is God's ideal for love.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.400]   And so you see a man and a woman
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.640]   just journeying through life together.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.720]   And so you see them in different phases
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.760]   of their relationship.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.440]   You see them before marriage.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.760]   You see them getting married.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.320]   You get to be a creeper in the honeymoon suite
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.740]   when they have sex on their first night of marriage.
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.960]   You see them into marriage fighting.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.360]   You see them having sex many years into marriage.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.160]   It's that kind of book.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.840]   Like God put that in, he put it in the Bible.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.520]   So just watch how it starts out.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.360]   Verse one, chapter one.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.520]   It's the girl and guy talking back and forth to each other.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.760]   I'm gonna just tell you the girl talks more than the guy.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.960]   Like the Bible gets us.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.320]   That's just the way it is.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.680]   It's science, okay?
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.920]   Here we go.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.720]   Verse one, it says, "The song of songs, which is Solomon's."
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.280]   The song of songs, that's a superlative.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.160]   It's like saying that Jesus is the Lord of all lords.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.640]   Solomon was a songwriter.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.280]   He wrote over a thousand songs.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.480]   When it says the song of songs,
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.760]   it's saying that this is his greatest hit.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.640]   "The song of songs, which is Solomon's."
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.480]   Watch verse two.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.180]   This is a girl talking.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.720]   "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth."
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.900]   This is the Bible, people.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.080]   This is the way this book goes.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.240]   "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.200]   for your love is better than wine."
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.240]   Now watch this, verse three.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.680]   "Your anointing oils are fragrant.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.480]   Your name is oil poured out."
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.400]   The first question that I wanna encourage you to ask
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.640]   that will save your marriage before it begins is this.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.560]   How do you both smell?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   Okay, you didn't see that coming, did you?
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.360]   Some of you are like, "I just came from the gym.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.560]   I already feel like a failure."
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.740]   Like, that's okay.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.480]   But the first question is, how do you both smell?
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.240]   That's a question that you should ask
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.840]   when you start dating someone,
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.860]   but you should ask that question individually
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.120]   about yourself right now.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   If you're single, how do you smell?
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.900]   Where am I getting that from?
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.640]   Well, did you see what she said?
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.520]   She said, "Your anointing oils are fragrant."
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.320]   What you need to know is in the ancient Near East,
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.560]   when the song of Solomon was written,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.320]   they didn't have water on tap.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.840]   Taking a shower every day, it wasn't a thing.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.260]   And so men would mask their natural musk
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.380]   by using oils and fragrances.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.280]   Some of you guys are like, "The Bible
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.440]   has never made more sense to me than right now."
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.480]   Because you're like the two people
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.400]   still using Axe body spray,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.220]   and you've believed the lie
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.560]   that Axe is a shower replacement
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.440]   instead of a shower enhancement, okay?
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.120]   2009 called and they want their body spray back, but...
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.560]   (congregation laughing)
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.640]   The reality is she's saying,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.400]   "Look, this guy, he looks good and he smells good."
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.880]   But then she turns the corner and what does she say?
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.600]   She says, "Your name," and in the Hebrew,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.560]   when that word name is used, it's a reference to character.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.440]   It's a reference to his entire being.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.360]   So she's saying, "Your entire being is oil poured out."
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.580]   So she switches from the physical smell of his body
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.320]   to the metaphorical smell of his being or his character.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.840]   She's saying, "You smell good inside and out."
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.380]   So it's just good to ask the question,
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.080]   like when your name is mentioned,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.800]   what fragrance is in the air?
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.040]   Like if someone mentioned your name,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:56.040]   would you be proud for that name to be associated with you?
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   Wait, that didn't make sense.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.000]   Let me run that back.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.880]   Okay, rewind.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.700]   If your name is mentioned,
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.020]   will people be proud that you are dating their friend?
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.500]   So like what fragrance is in the air
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.460]   when your name is mentioned?
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.060]   Some of you are like, "Man, that makes me feel
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.980]   "like a failure because I have a tough past."
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.340]   Hey, I just wanna be clear from the start.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.300]   Jesus Christ is in the business
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.260]   of giving clean starts to messy lives.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.220]   So you are not defined by your past.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.980]   And at the same time, I'm just talking about
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.400]   right now where you're at.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   How do you smell?
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.080]   Let me give you a vision for what you want, okay?
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.960]   I've got three crazy boys, Noah, Andrew, and Jake.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.400]   Noah, my oldest, who's 13 now,
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.280]   he was the first grandchild on either side of our families,
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.640]   which means he got more attention
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.840]   than any other grandkid has gotten.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.240]   At the first Christmas, I rarely got to hold my own son
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.360]   because he was always being held by one of his grandparents.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.660]   And so the rare occasions that I did get to hold Noah,
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.540]   after two seconds of holding him,
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.100]   I would get this whiff of old lady perfume
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.120]   because it was clear that he had been spending time
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.500]   with either Tata or Nana.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.140]   That's what you want.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.380]   When you get around someone,
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.380]   it should only take a couple seconds
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.660]   before you get a whiff of Jesus in their lives.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.300]   And when someone gets around you,
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.400]   it shouldn't take long before they begin
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.000]   to smell Jesus in your life.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.800]   Well, how do you smell like Jesus?
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.560]   Well, smelling like Jesus is what naturally happens
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.480]   when a guy or a girl surrenders their life to Jesus Christ.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.880]   You come to a place where you recognize
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   that Jesus Christ is Savior of the world
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.880]   and he is actually King, and he's a good King.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.040]   What do kings do?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.360]   They rule.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.000]   And so you've come to a place in your life
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.080]   where you just have realized,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.720]   I want Jesus Christ to be in charge.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.600]   I want him to rule in my life.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.780]   And when you know Jesus, you know what happens?
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.520]   The Spirit of God comes and lives inside of you.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.040]   And as you surrender each day to the Spirit at work in you,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.040]   the Spirit of God begins to shape you into Christ-likeness.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.840]   And as you begin to look more like Jesus,
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.240]   you begin to naturally smell like Jesus.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.360]   This is what happens when you surrender to God.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.040]   This is what happens when the Spirit
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.320]   is at work in your life.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.560]   This is what happens when an individual
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.800]   begins to read the Word of God,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.480]   because you can't know God's Word without knowing his,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.800]   you can't know God's ways without knowing his Word.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.880]   So when you take this Word to heart,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.480]   when you get connected with other believers,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.120]   and you live in open, honest relationships
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.840]   with one another, and people begin to encourage you,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.960]   you know what happens is you begin to smell
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.640]   as if you've been around Jesus.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.740]   That is what you want.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:06.280]   Our tendency is to minimize the importance
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.020]   of someone recognizing Jesus as Lord.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.600]   If we're not careful, we'll make God just a box to check
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.400]   when it comes to dating.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.400]   So it's like, well, I think I saw him at the porch.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.000]   We went on a date and she mentioned church,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.600]   so I'm sure that they're good, so check on that.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.960]   Do we like laughing together?
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.320]   I think we like the same music.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.600]   We're both really ambitious, so I think that we're good.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.800]   No, let's be clear.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.160]   I'm gonna tell you what my good friend Greg Mott told me.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.880]   There's a huge difference between a Christian boy
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.640]   and a godly man.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.000]   There's a big difference between a Christian girl
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.140]   and a godly woman.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.480]   Okay, godly men and godly women smell
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.800]   as if they've been around Jesus.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.720]   So let me ask you just some very specific questions, okay?
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   If you wanna know if you smell like Jesus,
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.880]   then answer this question.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Do you right now smell more of conviction or compromise?
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.760]   What do those words mean?
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.740]   What I mean by conviction is I mean you care more
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.140]   about God's ways than other people's opinions.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.580]   And when I talk about compromise,
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.700]   I'm talking about settling for less
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.640]   than God's standards for you.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.360]   So do you smell more of conviction or compromise?
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.360]   Does the person that you're interested in
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.880]   or the person that you're dating
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.840]   or the person that you're engaged to,
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.200]   do they smell of conviction or compromise?
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.480]   So just think about this.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.180]   It's easy to smell like Jesus on a Tuesday night,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.740]   and it's easy to smell like Jesus on a Sunday morning,
[00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.800]   but how does he or she smell
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.340]   on Thursday, Friday, Saturday night?
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.740]   How does she smell at happy hour with coworkers?
[00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.100]   Okay, if he will make you babysit him when he is drunk,
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.220]   when else will you have to babysit him?
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.420]   Okay, if he or she will cuss around you,
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.460]   they'll probably cuss around your kids.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.320]   If he or she will cheat at work,
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.220]   that means that they're fine cheating.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.540]   How are they, how do they interact
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.580]   with people of the opposite sex?
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.460]   If they're known as a player,
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.980]   what makes you think they're not playing you?
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.100]   So you just wanna ask the question,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.660]   do they smell more of conviction or compromise?
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.060]   Do you smell more of conviction or compromise?
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.100]   If you're sitting there saying,
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.240]   I kinda feel like I smell of compromise,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.180]   you know what, Jesus can freshen you up really quickly.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.220]   He's that good.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.900]   He loves you, and he can pull you in close,
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.100]   and he can go to work,
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.940]   and he can do a great work in your life.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.940]   I'll ask you, I'll ask you this,
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.020]   not just do you smell of conviction or compromise,
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.020]   but this, do you smell of faithfulness or flakiness?
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.900]   Okay, does he or she smell of faithfulness or flakiness?
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.560]   I remember when my wife Kat and I, when we started dating,
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.060]   I was just so impressed by her
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.160]   because she was a faithful person.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.240]   So she was a sales rep at IBM,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.940]   and all of her coworkers loved her
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.240]   because she was a faithful friend at work.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.520]   But then on the weekends, she was invested in her church.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.240]   I still remember pulling up and seeing her sit
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.280]   with a small group of high school girls
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.560]   that she was investing her life in,
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.820]   teaching them the Bible
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.440]   because she was faithfully serving her church
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.920]   and investing in the next generation.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.000]   And then I began to meet Katherine's friends
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.280]   because that's the deal, guys.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.200]   If you wanna get with a girl,
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.320]   you gotta get with her friends.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.700]   And so when I began,
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.540]   that's according to the Spice Girls anyway,
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.960]   but when I began to meet her friends,
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.280]   here's what was so surprising to me.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.340]   All of Katherine's friends considered Kat their best friend.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.400]   And I was like, that's so amazing.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.960]   Like there are multiple girls
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.200]   who look at you as their best friend.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.720]   Why is that?
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.560]   She's a faithful friend.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.960]   There is no drama about her.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.440]   Like Katherine exudes joy.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.140]   You just get around her and you feel better about life.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.360]   She's a faithful friend.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.760]   And so I just think about that
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.680]   and I'm like, that's what you want.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.880]   You wanna be a faithful person, not a flaky person.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.560]   So can people count on you to do what you say
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.800]   that you are going to do?
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.160]   Are you where you say you are going to be?
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.640]   Do you follow through?
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.500]   Does drama follow you around?
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.200]   Okay.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.320]   We wanna be people who smell as if we've been around Jesus.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.280]   So here's just a good rule to live by if you're single,
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.560]   become the person that you wanna marry.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.360]   Like whoever you wanna marry,
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.120]   whatever you want them to be like,
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.240]   if you want them to reek of Jesus,
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.880]   then become the person that you wanna marry.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.640]   Because you know what?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.880]   If you want to marry a godly woman,
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.720]   well, you know what?
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.880]   Godly women are attracted to godliness.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.480]   So surrender your life to Jesus.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.600]   Here's the second question
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   that I believe will save your marriage before it begins.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.760]   Do you have the right people in your life?
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.560]   Okay, do you have the right people in your life?
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.800]   So now we're skipping ahead in the book.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.740]   We're gonna look at different sections
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.600]   of the entire book.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.240]   So now we're skipping ahead a few verses to verse nine.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.960]   We just saw the girl speak,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.400]   now the guy is speaking and look at what he says.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   Verse nine, he says,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.040]   "I compare you my love to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots."
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.120]   Baby, you're a horse.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   That's what he just said.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.960]   Guys, don't use it.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.960]   It's not gonna work.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:56.120]   Verse 10, "Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.680]   "your neck with strings of jewels."
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   Now this is interesting because in verse 11,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.400]   the girl's friends chime in.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.280]   Anytime there's a guy and girl dating,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.520]   there's always a group of the girl's friends nearby.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.360]   And so they chime in and look at what they say.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.240]   They say, "We will make for you ornaments
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.640]   "of gold studded with silver."
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.200]   So here's this group of friends
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.640]   that are looking at their girl friends saying,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.560]   "Hey, we wanna make you more beautiful for this man."
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.640]   Okay, guys, I wanna let you in on something.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   I worked with college students at Texas A&M University
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.800]   for five and a half years.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.380]   And here's what I learned for five and a half years, okay?
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.080]   Guys, here's what you need to know happens
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.040]   when you call a girl up and ask her out.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.960]   I'm not talking about meeting her on a dating app.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.220]   I know a lot of people meet these days through a dating app,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.140]   but I'm talking, if you do the old fashioned way in college,
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.080]   and you call a girl up and ask her out,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.420]   guys, I just want you to know,
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.680]   if you did that in your past, what happened, okay?
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.680]   When y'all hung up the phone, this is what that girl did.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.560]   Okay, I'm telling you, this is just reality.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.280]   I'm educating you now.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.680]   She got off the phone and here's exactly what she did.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   She went, "Ladies, assemble!"
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.060]   And it doesn't matter where she was
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.920]   on the planet at the time.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.200]   It doesn't matter where her best girlfriends
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.040]   were on the planet.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.200]   Somehow they magically appeared in 30 seconds.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.500]   They were all right there.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:35.280]   And she informed them that you asked her out.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:41.060]   And then one of them took charge and asked the question.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.520]   Not a question, the question.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.280]   What was the question?
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.480]   What are you gonna wear?
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:53.760]   And then she gave the response.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.600]   I don't really have anything.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.760]   And that's all those girls needed to hear.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.440]   They're like, we got you.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.000]   So you need to know, guys, when she opened that door,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.480]   she didn't own a thing that she was wearing.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.360]   Am I wrong?
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.760]   She didn't own a thing of it.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.200]   But that's a really amazing thing
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.160]   because what you see is you see these girls
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.040]   that were like, hey, we are committed to you.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.620]   We want to make you as beautiful as possible
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.000]   for this guy who's gonna come and pick you up.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.120]   You know what's even better?
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.920]   When there's a group of girls who have a vision
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.400]   for how to just bring out Jesus in their friend.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.960]   And now I'm not just talking about girls.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.300]   I'm talking about guys as well.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.320]   Like the best thing for you
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.520]   is to have a group of girls if you're a girl,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.120]   a group of guys if you're a guy
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.260]   who are committed to making you more like Jesus.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.960]   That they are committed to seeing the character of Jesus
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.120]   come out in your life.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.540]   And so the question that I'm asking is,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.440]   is do you have the right people in your life?
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.840]   Because here's the reality.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.640]   Like if you have a roommate right now,
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.280]   and even if you don't have a roommate,
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.120]   whoever your closest friends are,
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.880]   if they are single and they end up getting married one day,
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.240]   they will be someone else's lifelong roommate.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.760]   So you can actually play a part
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   in helping them become the best lifelong roommate possible.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.800]   Like do you have some people in your life
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   who are not afraid to wound you by telling you the truth?
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.840]   The author of Proverbs says that,
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.720]   "The wounds of a friend can be trusted,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.800]   "but an enemy multiplies kisses."
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.760]   Do you know what he's saying?
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.920]   He's saying, look, those who really love you
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.720]   aren't afraid to wound you by saying the truth.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.320]   But you know what your enemy does?
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.020]   Your enemy just tells you what you want to hear.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.020]   So do you have someone in your life
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.080]   that is close enough to you that could say,
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.120]   hey, you know what?
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.440]   There are times where I feel like
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.120]   I have to walk on eggshells around you.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.000]   You know what they're saying?
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.760]   They're saying, you're kind of moody.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.560]   That's good for you to know.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.880]   Hey, when you're frustrated with me, you shut me out.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.800]   Like you stop talking to me.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.440]   You don't respond to me for days.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.000]   And then when we get back together and hang out,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.660]   you act as if nothing happened.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.940]   That kind of feels like something that should be addressed.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:32.120]   I don't think you ever have said the words, I'm sorry.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.060]   And so I just want to encourage you
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.200]   that that probably isn't the healthiest thing.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.040]   Or you know what?
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.280]   There's times where I hear you talk
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.040]   and I know the truth and you're exaggerating the truth.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.180]   And I just want to encourage you
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.560]   to be a man or a woman of your word.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.920]   Hey, how's your time with the Lord going?
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.860]   Are you experiencing consistency?
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.120]   If not, let's help one another out.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.800]   Do you have those people in your life?
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.920]   Let me just give you a vision
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.120]   for what you want on your wedding day.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.640]   When you stand on that altar,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.800]   what you want to be able to do
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.440]   is you want to be able to look to your right or your left
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.240]   at either your groomsmen or your bridesmaids.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.640]   And what you want to be able to do
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.160]   is you want to be able to look at each guy or each girl
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.180]   and know exactly why they're on that stage.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.480]   Because God used them in your life
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.200]   to make you more like Jesus.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.160]   So when I stood on that altar in Wichita Falls,
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.040]   I had 13 groomsmen.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.720]   You're like, that's a brag, man.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.200]   Like you clearly have a bunch of friends.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.760]   No, it's because my wife has a bunch of friends
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.440]   and she had 13 bridesmaids.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.640]   So I was like, I got my yard guy there.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.760]   I got the RA in my dorm from years ago.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.080]   I was like, man, come on.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.060]   What's your name again?
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.260]   You'll work, you know?
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.040]   But when I stood on that stage and I looked down that line,
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.360]   I could look and say, you know what?
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.760]   God used these guys in my worst moments.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.200]   When I was at rock bottom,
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.800]   at the height of my compromise in life,
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.960]   God used them to pick me up and restore me
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.640]   and help me get back on the path with Jesus.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.480]   You know what?
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.080]   God used this guy to teach me the word of God.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.560]   So I began to develop a love for the scriptures.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:10.380]   You know what?
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.900]   This person helped me enter
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.160]   into healthy conflict resolution.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.020]   That's what you want.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.880]   Do you have the right people in your life?
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   Here's the third question
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.440]   that'll save your marriage before it begins.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.540]   Do you know the difference between spring and winter?
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.400]   Do you know the difference between spring and winter?
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.680]   Skipping ahead now to chapter two, okay?
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.640]   Verse 10.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.880]   So the context here is that the guy
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.680]   comes to visit his girl.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.600]   He's come from out of town
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.180]   and he is inviting her out of the house
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.460]   to take a walk with him.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.400]   Verse 10.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.920]   The woman's speaking and she says,
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.240]   "My beloved speaks and says to me,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   "arise my love, my beautiful one, and come away.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.380]   "For behold, the winter is past.
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.740]   "The rain is over and gone.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.200]   "The flowers appear on the earth.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.060]   "The time of singing has come.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.180]   "And the voice of the turtle dove is heard in our land.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.700]   "The fig tree ripens its figs.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.260]   "The vines are in blossom.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.800]   "They give forth fragrance.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.440]   "Arise my love, my beautiful one, and come away with me."
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.880]   Do you see what he's talking about?
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.080]   So he's inviting her to take a walk with him.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.780]   And what does he start describing?
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.560]   He starts describing springtime.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.640]   He talks about turtle doves.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.480]   He talks about figs.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.520]   And he's talking about things in blossom.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.920]   He's talking about the time of year,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.720]   the season where things are in bloom.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.360]   That life is visible on the earth.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.600]   And he's using springtime as a picture
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.760]   for their relationship.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.320]   He's saying it's springtime outside
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.720]   and it's springtime in our relationship.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.320]   You know that time of year,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.720]   like right after winter in Texas,
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.680]   it's like that one day in March
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.760]   where it's sunny and 75 with a slight breeze.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.480]   And it's like the day before it starts feeling
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.400]   like you're standing in front of a blowtorch.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.320]   Do you know what I'm talking about?
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.240]   It's like that one day.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.400]   And like you walk outside and the breeze hits you
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.120]   and you involuntarily like close your eyes
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.660]   and just stop for a moment.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:29.560]   Because everything feels right for that moment.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.640]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.500]   He's saying it's springtime in our relationship.
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.640]   And so the question is,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.040]   do you know the difference between winter and spring?
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:40.860]   What's winter?
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.200]   Winter is the time when everything goes dormant
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.280]   or everything dies and there's no signs of life.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.880]   When Catherine and I started dating,
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.760]   we dated for eight and a half months
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.320]   and then we got married within 12 and a half months
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.840]   of our first date.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.360]   And I would just say that our relationship,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.840]   it felt like spring.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.360]   It wasn't perfect.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.920]   Like you need to know we had conflict.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.800]   Okay?
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.760]   Conflict is a part of every relationship.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.400]   If there's no conflict, that's the problem.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.320]   Like if you have no issues, that's your issue.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.120]   It's because you're ignoring the issues.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.280]   The conflict is a part of every relationship.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.920]   Conflict is actually an opportunity to glorify God.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.540]   But our relationship, it felt like spring.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.760]   It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't complicated.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.220]   There was no on again, off again.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.120]   There was no really difficult conversations
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.640]   of like what are we and is this really happening
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.040]   and where are we at with all of this?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.120]   We knew what we wanted.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.920]   Like we were both headed towards marriage.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.000]   That's why we got into the relationship.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.760]   We both were following Jesus.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.440]   We both wanted to follow Jesus individually
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.080]   and we wanted to follow him collectively.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.320]   We were on the same page.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.960]   We were headed in the same direction.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.120]   It felt like spring.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.820]   And yet I know what it's like to be in relationships
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.040]   that feel more like winter.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.240]   Like I've been in relationships
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.160]   that really had looking back no signs of life.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.200]   Like I've been in the relationships
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.440]   where it's on again, off again.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   And it's just so difficult
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.060]   because you never know where you're at.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.720]   So it's like are we on or are we off?
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.460]   Like we're mad at each other.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.520]   We're mad at each other.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.000]   Now we're not mad at each other.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.080]   Now we're mad in love with each other.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.120]   Now we're not mad in love with each other.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.900]   And there's hours and hours of conversation
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.320]   trying to figure out what we are and what we're not.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.160]   Are we gonna do this?
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.120]   Are we not gonna do this?
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.020]   It's winter.
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.040]   I've been in relationships
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.480]   where things got really physical really fast
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.880]   so there was guilt and shame
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.160]   because that side of marriage,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.920]   there were certain things that we didn't wanna do
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.080]   that we ended up doing.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.200]   And so it felt like winter
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.720]   because guilt and shame was just constantly
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.860]   sucking out any of the joy of our relationship.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.460]   And because we got so physical so fast,
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:13.140]   we never really got to know each other
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:17.340]   because we just spent all of our time doing physical stuff.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.700]   And so it kept us in the relationship a lot longer
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.720]   than we should have ever been in it.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.800]   Because in the end, that relationship,
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.380]   even though it was great person,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.820]   just wasn't the right relationship.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:30.660]   It was winter.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.060]   I've been in relationship
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.900]   where there's a lot of insecurity.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.980]   Like I still remember I was in this relationship
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.260]   where I was so nervous
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.760]   that this girl was gonna break up with me
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.340]   because she told me she didn't know
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:46.380]   if she wanted to keep dating
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.820]   because she didn't know if she liked how I looked.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.340]   And I just remember like feeling so anxious about it.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:55.040]   I look back now, I'm like, that was winter.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.780]   That was winter.
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.780]   Like if you wanna know if you're in winter,
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.680]   it's when a girl's like,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.060]   I don't know if I like how you look
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.260]   so I'll get back to you.
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.180]   Winter.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.860]   Were those relationships fun?
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.860]   Sure.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.820]   Did we make memories?
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.220]   Yes.
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.780]   Did it provide companionship?
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.820]   Absolutely.
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:23.340]   Yet, all the drama, all the insecurity,
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.580]   all the back and forth, all the tough conversations,
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.820]   all the guilt choked out the joy.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.060]   It was winter.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:32.900]   And you're like, so you're telling me
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.140]   that relationships always have to feel like spring?
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.580]   No.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.420]   Every relationship has different seasons.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.740]   And so just so you know,
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.460]   there are going to be some days
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.980]   that feel like winter in relationships.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.300]   There are going to be some weeks in marriage
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:49.700]   that feel like winter.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.260]   But it is not winter all year long
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:57.580]   anywhere in this world that you want to live.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.940]   Period.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.060]   It is not winter all year long
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.220]   anywhere that you want to be.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.100]   And the same is true
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.420]   when it comes to romantic relationships.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.020]   If the winter in your relationship,
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.420]   if the winter inside your relationship
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.900]   is lasting longer than the winter outside,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.340]   there's probably very little signs of life.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:25.020]   And so this is me just stepping in.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.020]   You guys don't know me.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.300]   I mean, I'm not around here much,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.580]   but this is just me coming in saying, look,
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.100]   if it's winter in a relationship
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.780]   for an extended period of time,
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.380]   it's not just going to magically turn to spring
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.940]   if you get married.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.300]   It will only get colder.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.500]   I promise you.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.860]   And so some of you guys just need to hear me say tonight,
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.300]   it might be time to have a tough conversation
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.780]   and go your separate ways.
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.620]   Why?
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.260]   Because in the end, it's not the right relationship.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.020]   Now, the reality is,
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.460]   I know what it's like to be in a relationship
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.620]   that you're scared to get out of.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.740]   And the reason that you're scared to get out of it
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.860]   is because you just can't envision your life
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.140]   without that person in it.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.220]   But just because you can't envision your life
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.340]   without that person in it
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.300]   doesn't mean God can't envision your life
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.460]   without that person in it.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.660]   He's trustworthy.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.020]   He's a good king.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.180]   Will you follow him?
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:30.900]   Next question that would hopefully save your marriage
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.020]   before it begins is this,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.540]   what is shaping your expectations of sex?
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.460]   Skip over to chapter four just real quick.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.260]   I just want to highlight this real quick.
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.220]   But look at the wording.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.540]   It says, "Behold," it's the guy talking.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:46.940]   "Behold, you're beautiful, my love.
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.060]   "Behold, you're beautiful.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.420]   "Your eyes are doves behind your veil.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.300]   "Your hair is like a flock of goats."
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.940]   Put that one away, guys.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:56.700]   And never bring it out.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.580]   "Your hair is like a flock of goats
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.220]   "leaping down the slopes of Gilead.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.540]   "Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes
[00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.020]   "that have come up from their washing."
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.540]   That's my favorite verse.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.260]   'Cause he's basically saying,
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.020]   "I love your teeth because you have all of them.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.100]   "Your lips," verse three,
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:18.820]   "are like a scarlet thread, and your mouth is lovely."
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.620]   He's just working his way down the woman's body.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.060]   This is on their wedding night.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.940]   And I love it because he's moving slowly.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.380]   Verse four, "Your neck is like the Tower of David
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.540]   "built in rows of stone."
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.140]   Who says that?
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.540]   "On it hang a thousand shields,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.860]   "all of them shields of warriors."
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.380]   He's talking about her necklace.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.020]   Verse five, "Your two breasts are like two fawns,
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.220]   "twins of a gazelle that gaze among the lilies."
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.060]   I wonder, I just picture this girl like,
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.740]   "Shut up already, like, please."
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.100]   But what I love is that he's moving slowly
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.620]   and he's communicating.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.660]   Most guys, when it comes,
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.700]   when you're in the moment having sex,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.540]   you can't even put a sentence together.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.380]   And here's this guy, he is communicating clearly.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.140]   I love that.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.820]   And he's moving slowly.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.300]   Verse nine, "You have captivated my heart,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.020]   "my sister, my bride.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.980]   "You've captivated my heart with one glance of your eyes,
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.460]   "with one jewel of your necklace.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.060]   "How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.020]   "How much better is your love than wine
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.220]   "and the fragrance of your oils than any spice."
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.060]   Like he is, they are moving towards sex
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.900]   and you know what he does?
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.860]   He just stops to affirm her more,
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.460]   which is amazing because most likely,
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.140]   this is this girl's first time
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.660]   to be naked in front of a man
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.540]   or ever touched in a sexual way by a man.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.540]   And so how is he operating slowly, safely, and selflessly?
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.740]   So a good question to ask is,
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.340]   what is shaping your expectations of sex?
[00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.260]   And I would imagine that for many of us, it's pornography.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.220]   Like statistics would show that for many of us,
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.780]   even though we know sex isn't reality,
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:09.780]   we still treat, even though we know porn is not reality,
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.620]   porn still acts like sex ed for many of us.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.380]   So the Barna Group does a study
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.220]   and they found that among young adults,
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.820]   57% of young adults seek porn out at least once a month.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.140]   So in this room, 57% of you
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.180]   most likely seek porn out once a month.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   Remember watching an interview with Channing Tatum
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.460]   and the interviewer said, "Hey, do you ever look at porn?"
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.300]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.220]   They said, "Have you looked at porn in the last six months?"
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:37.740]   He's like, "Yeah."
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.260]   "Last six weeks?"
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.340]   "Yeah."
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.940]   "Last six days?"
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.380]   "Yeah."
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.340]   "Last six hours?"
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.500]   He's like, "What time is it?"
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.180]   And it's kind of like, it was meant to be funny,
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:51.460]   lighthearted, why?
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.620]   Because porn has just become normalized in our society.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.580]   Pornography was a part of my story for seven years,
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.940]   was a part of my journey.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.740]   And you know what it has done is it's hijacked,
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.740]   it hijacked my understanding of sex.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.460]   And so I even carried that into marriage,
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.040]   not the struggle with pornography
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.100]   because God freed me from it,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.540]   the act of it prior to marriage,
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.300]   but what I brought into marriage was a tendency
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.500]   to try and pornify my marriage.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.740]   See, that's what you'll do,
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.220]   is because what pornography will do
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.460]   is it will hijack your expectations for sex.
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.980]   But what you have to understand is that pornography,
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.300]   if it's shaping your understanding,
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.380]   this is where I'm trying to save your marriage
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.580]   before it begins.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.340]   Studies have observed a correlation
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.660]   between men's porn usage and greater sexual dissatisfaction
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.100]   with their significant other
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.900]   in the form of sexual boredom or disappointment.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.420]   So if you bring porn into your marriage, men,
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.540]   there's a high likelihood that you will experience
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.220]   disappointment or boredom with your spouse
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.820]   because she is not who you watch in pornographic films.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.100]   But the same can go for women, ladies.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.200]   Like, pornography isn't just a guy problem,
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.500]   it's a people problem.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.540]   And statistics would show that women struggle with porn
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.220]   just as much as guys do.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.220]   Another study demonstrated that a man's porn use
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:23.340]   can cause a woman to be more self-conscious
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.420]   about her body and sexual performance,
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.140]   and thus lead to a decrease in attraction
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.380]   and desire for intimacy in the woman.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.420]   So men, if you bring porn into your marriage,
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:35.500]   and I'll flip it, women,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.900]   if you bring porn into your marriage,
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.020]   you know what it can do?
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.420]   It can cause insecurity in your spouse,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.540]   and it can decrease their attraction to you
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.940]   or their desire to be with you.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.940]   Another study found that over an extended period of time,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.620]   if there's porn use in the marriage,
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.620]   that the probability of divorce doubles.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.380]   And so I just tell you that to say,
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.820]   look, some of y'all are like, well, I've already blown it.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:03.520]   Like, I've been looking at porn for years.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.460]   Hey, remember the power of Jesus Christ,
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.500]   that he gives new starts to messy lives,
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.260]   and it is never too late to step into obedience.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.020]   And God can do a great work in your life,
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.100]   and you can have a great marriage
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.340]   that is preceded by an extended season of purity.
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.820]   And that will be a blessing to your spouse.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:32.420]   Next question quickly is this, do you know what love is?
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.220]   Do you know what love is?
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.380]   You look at Song of Solomon, chapter eight.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.940]   If you skip over to chapter eight,
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.300]   this is the love passage in the Bible
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.620]   when it comes to romantic love
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.180]   between a man and a woman, verse six.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.580]   The woman is talking, she says,
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.780]   "Set me as a seal upon your heart,
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.660]   "as a seal upon your arm," watch this,
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.940]   "for love is strong as death,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.900]   "jealousy as fierce as the grave,
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.640]   "it's flashes or flashes of fire,
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.300]   "the very flame of the Lord.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.140]   "Many waters cannot quench love,
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.700]   "neither can floods drown it out.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.420]   "If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house,
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.460]   "he would be utterly despised."
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.580]   Do you see what she's saying?
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.260]   She says, "Love is as strong as death."
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.540]   In the ancient Near East,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:18.340]   people would compare their feelings to death
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.980]   to convey the intensity of them.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.460]   We still do that today.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.340]   We will still text, "I'm dead."
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.860]   Like we still use it to convey our feelings.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.740]   We're just being biblical when we say that.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.220]   But if you think about death,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.620]   death is irreversible, right?
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.820]   Like no one dies and changes their mind.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.020]   It's irreversible.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.700]   She says, "Love is as strong as death."
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.000]   So when you stand on the altar one day and you say,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.780]   "I promise to love you until death do you part,"
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.740]   you know what you're saying?
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:53.080]   You're saying, "Look, I know what love is.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.160]   "Love is a choice.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.100]   "Sometimes it's a feeling, but it is always a choice.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.760]   "I don't need to know what's going to happen
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.620]   "between now and the day we die,
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.440]   "but I do know that I am committed to loving you
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.460]   "every single day because love is irreversible."
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.660]   And she says, "It's as jealous as the grave."
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.700]   Jealousy there, it's not talking about insecurity.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.500]   It is talking about intense passion.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.200]   It's the idea that love is passionately exclusive.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.060]   It's as jealous as the grave.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.140]   If you think about the grave,
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:26.840]   the grave doesn't share with anyone.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.740]   Like no one gets put in the ground and then shared around.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.720]   It's passionately exclusive.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.440]   The love that I have with Kat
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.940]   is not to be shared with anyone else in the world.
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.600]   That's why websites like AshleyMadison.com,
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.560]   it's an app that exists for married people
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.760]   to have an affair.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.160]   The tagline for Ashley Madison is,
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.540]   "Life is short, have an affair."
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.800]   It is the opposite of love.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.200]   The final question that I want to ask you is this,
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.840]   to hopefully save your marriage before it begins.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.900]   Have you both experienced a greater love?
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.000]   Have you both experienced a greater love?
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.340]   See, the love between a man and a woman
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.520]   in the Song of Solomon,
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   it's ultimately to point to a love that is greater,
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.760]   the love of Jesus Christ that he has for his people,
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   the church, the bride of Christ.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:26.380]   Do you know the love of God,
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:31.380]   that God, a perfect father, gave his son for you?
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.540]   In love, he gave his son for you,
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.580]   Jesus Christ, who wasn't his God.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:38.620]   He left heaven on a pursuit,
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.300]   like a man should pursue a woman.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   He left heaven pursuing you in me, coming to earth.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.560]   And he loved you enough that he would give his life for you.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.620]   So when Jesus Christ hung on the cross,
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.300]   he was thinking about you, in love.
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.740]   Have you ever thought that there is someone in this world
[00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.820]   that loved you so much that they actually died for you?
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.540]   And when he died on that cross,
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.420]   he took all of your sins upon himself.
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.220]   On the third day, he rose from the dead,
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.460]   conquering your sins, why?
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.340]   So that you could be completely forgiven by God.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.300]   It doesn't matter where you've been, what you've done.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.620]   Do you believe that because God loves you so much,
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.940]   he can forgive anything you've done,
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.020]   no matter where you've been and what you've done?
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:25.620]   And Jesus Christ has come so that through faith in him,
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.680]   when you surrender your life to him,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:28.900]   you know what happens?
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:33.900]   Is you enter into a real, enjoyable,
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.020]   intimate relationship that will last for all of eternity.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.340]   Jesus wants you for all of eternity.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.020]   Do you know that greater love?
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.020]   I wanna close tonight just by
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.140]   illustrating what I'm talking about tonight.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.380]   So if I can just invite some friends on stage, real quick.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.460]   (audience murmuring)
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:07.500]   This is my friend Andrea, and I'm just gonna ask her
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.780]   if she will just run in place.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.880]   So if you'll just start running in place for a minute,
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.280]   or maybe for a few, but yeah, you wanna stretch it out,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.060]   get loose, it's great, good.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.060]   So here's what I want you to think about, okay?
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.300]   Andrea's running to symbolize running towards Jesus.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.900]   And so she's fixing her attention forward,
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.500]   she knows Jesus, she loves Jesus,
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.380]   and she is running towards Jesus.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.580]   This is where you wanna be,
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:36.460]   this is what you wanna be doing, okay?
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.140]   You wanna smell like Jesus,
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.860]   you wanna live fully surrendered to him,
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.220]   you wanna fix your gaze on him and run towards him
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.100]   with all of your heart.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.180]   And for some of you, this is just what you need
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.940]   to focus on right now.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.380]   You need to not worry about finding the one,
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.580]   you need to just focus on being with Jesus
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.780]   and enjoying Jesus.
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.380]   But if you're in a good place to date,
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.660]   like Andrea, here's the reality,
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.460]   like you've got options.
[00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.420]   And so, hey, let me just say this,
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.340]   for the guys in the room, like we can flip this as well.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.500]   So this isn't just an illustration
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.120]   for the girls regarding guys, like you can flip it.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.580]   Guys, you can imagine yourself surrounded by girls.
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.940]   Some of you are like, Lord, please make that so.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.940]   (congregation laughing)
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.220]   But Andrea, like you've got options,
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.780]   like you've got this option back here.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.220]   Andrea, why don't you go ahead and check it out?
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:34.740]   Now, don't take your eyes off Jesus,
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.740]   but Andrea, don't look back, but what do you think?
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:44.420]   Like, hello, Andrea, I told you, stop,
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.700]   don't look at me, don't look at him.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.860]   Here's the reality, like you have options,
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.500]   but there are good options,
[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.660]   and then there are options that aren't the best.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.380]   So you've got some people
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:59.920]   who are walking through life right now,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:05.320]   and they're just walking at a pace that you're not.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.100]   It's not possible to run towards Jesus
[00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.060]   and keep your eyes on Jesus and look back at the same time.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.220]   And so there's going to be some options in your life
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.820]   where they don't smell like Jesus.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.980]   You get around them and you don't smell Jesus
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.620]   because they're not living surrendered to Jesus.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.380]   Or you know what, their understanding of sex
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:26.920]   isn't being shaped by the word of God,
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.580]   it's being shaped by culture.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:31.180]   Or maybe they just don't have the right people
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:35.540]   in their life who are sharpening them and encouraging them.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.600]   And so I'm just telling you
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.780]   that this guy isn't the best option.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.020]   And then you got these options.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.380]   So guys, you need to be running
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.700]   because if you're not running,
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.500]   she's going to leave you in the dust.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.660]   But you got these different options.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:53.180]   Now, I think about this option right here.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.020]   And here's the thing,
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.620]   like he's running at the same speed you are.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:57.720]   Here's the difference.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:02.220]   He's running in slightly a different direction than you are.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.380]   And so this is where things can get problematic
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.380]   because you know what, you can look and be like,
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.300]   yeah, but you know what, we have so much fun together
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.620]   and he's a family guy and he's got a lot of integrity
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.780]   at his work and we're both highly ambitious.
[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.700]   And so we could be a power couple together
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.820]   because we're both crushing it on our work.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.260]   We're both making a lot of money.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.660]   You put that together and the double income,
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:31.900]   no kids season of life will be glorious.
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.580]   And we like the same foods, we like the same music.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.900]   We got tickets to T-Swift today.
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.460]   And so we're going to do that and that's going to be awesome.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.380]   Here's the problem is that he is,
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.260]   right now it looks like he's just heading
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.900]   in slightly different direction,
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.260]   but you play this out over decades
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.060]   and those are two totally different trajectories.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.740]   Andrea, my fear is that this is a scenario
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:02.420]   with a guy who has never experienced that greater love.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.180]   What is most important to you, Jesus,
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.020]   isn't important to him.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   And if you're not careful,
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.080]   you'll spend your marriage praying for your spouse
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.860]   instead of praying with your spouse.
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.940]   And so then Andrea, you've got guys that
[00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.180]   you look to your right or your left,
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.900]   hey, you don't need to find the one,
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.120]   you can just find one.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.620]   And so let's just say you're out,
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.380]   like you can just find one.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:33.020]   And here's the thing, like this is what you want.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.240]   Like you want to just run towards Jesus
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.940]   and if you look to your right or your left
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.220]   and you see someone else running towards Jesus,
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.860]   you find someone that you get around him
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.540]   and he smells like Jesus,
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.100]   you spend time with him and it's clear
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.420]   that he has friends who are encouraging him,
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.500]   he has the right people in his life,
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.260]   it's clear that he has an understanding
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.340]   of what a spring-like relationship looks like,
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.300]   he has a vision for what love is,
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.540]   he's experienced that greater love,
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:06.180]   then that can be a really good thing.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:09.700]   But it isn't an ultimate thing.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:10.980]   So here's the thing, Andrea,
[00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.340]   whether that's your reality,
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:13.760]   and that could be your reality,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:18.020]   like this winter, maybe God brings you into a relationship
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.300]   and if he does, praise God, that's a good thing.
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.620]   But whether that's your reality or this is your reality,
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:28.480]   the best thing you can do is run wholeheartedly
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.860]   towards Jesus 'cause we don't run to find a spouse,
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.940]   we run to enjoy Jesus.
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.780]   Would you guys give Andrea a hand?
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:42.280]   (congregation applauding)
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:48.980]   I just wanna ask you to close your eyes.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:54.900]   And I just wanna ask you to do business
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:55.900]   with the Lord right now.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.860]   I don't know what he's doing in your heart,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.340]   I don't know what he's saying to you,
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:02.300]   I don't know what he's pressing on you with,
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:05.140]   but I do wanna say if you're here tonight
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.800]   and you're understanding what a greater love looks like
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.440]   for the first time, for the first time
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.280]   you're understanding the love that Jesus Christ has for you,
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.660]   and you wanna begin a relationship with him,
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.640]   then I just encourage you right in this moment
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.100]   to invite him in through faith.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.100]   Just say, Lord Jesus, would you come into my life tonight?
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.920]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:32.240]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died on the cross for me.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.700]   Thank you that you rose from the dead for me.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.740]   Would you come into my life?
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:42.500]   Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:46.380]   And would you begin to lead me in a new life?
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.720]   No matter where you're at,
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.140]   maybe God's calling you to get out of a relationship.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.540]   Maybe God's just revealing an area of your life
[00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.220]   that doesn't smell like him.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.160]   My hope is that you'd just find his grace in this moment,
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.760]   that you would sense that he's speaking to you
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.940]   because he loves you.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:11.280]   He's not mad at you, but he loves you deeply.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:15.220]   And so would you just sit in that love tonight,
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.620]   and would you meet with him?
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.200]   (gentle music)
