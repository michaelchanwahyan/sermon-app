[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   Oh, how you guys doing?
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.440]   Good?
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.340]   I am excited to be here.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.780]   Man, that was powerful and amazing.
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.140]   For those that don't know, me and my family,
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.180]   we live in Maui, Hawaii, which is awesome,
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.320]   and we love it, and it's incredible.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320]   Shout out, someone came from there?
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.220]   Okay.
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.320]   I think there's someone from every state
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   except Vermont, come on, Vermont.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.220]   Who's the Hawaii person?
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.360]   We got some Hawaii people?
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.200]   Hawaii people?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.040]   You're not here, you wanna be quiet?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.760]   Okay, thank you, I love you.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.000]   Trying to represent, got owned right there.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.480]   Very excited to be here, but what I was gonna say
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.880]   is how incredible this is to see something like this
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.220]   and how powerful it is, because man,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.280]   in Maui, it's a little bit of like a small town,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.640]   small island, and so I think our mega church,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.600]   and I mean like the one that does the VBS,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.040]   the one that does the events,
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.220]   the one that does the conferences,
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.080]   I think is probably like this big right here,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.560]   this section, so appreciate you guys, by the way.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.320]   So it's just incredible to be in a room
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.640]   with this thousands of young people
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.720]   worshiping, loving the Lord, opening up the scriptures.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.560]   It's really amazing.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.960]   So if you have your Bible, Genesis 2,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.940]   Genesis 2, if you were here on the porch on Tuesday,
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.100]   yes, I was in Genesis 1, so maybe in the next 900 years
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.220]   while I visit, we can maybe get through
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.180]   the whole Bible together.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.660]   And the same problem is happening,
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.060]   whereas I told you my two-year-old
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.780]   ripped my Genesis 1 and 2, so hopefully I can read it okay.
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.820]   Like I said, hopefully, I don't know why
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.720]   she hates the scriptures, but anyways.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.260]   I'm excited to be with you guys.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.380]   Now, I have a very big task today, self-imposed, I guess,
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.300]   but I want to basically summarize the entire scriptures
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300]   for you in the next 30 minutes.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.060]   Can we do that, can we buckle up and get ready?
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.820]   So here's the reason.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.300]   I believe that so many of us,
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.260]   specifically in the Western Evangelical Church,
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.220]   we're very good at memorizing verses,
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.780]   we're very good at tattooing them on our wrists.
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.900]   Anyone else got the cliche Greek?
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.980]   Okay, me too.
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.460]   We're very good at the micro,
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.540]   we're not very good at the macro.
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.900]   There's something about the, like I would say,
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.500]   another way to put it is we're malnourished,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.700]   we have a missing nutrient, and that's the story of God.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.180]   Beginning to end, God is doing something,
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.780]   and there's something powerful about that
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420]   when you understand the metanarrative,
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.380]   which is a big theological term for it.
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.220]   When you understand that,
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.260]   I think it does something deeply to you and your walk
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.100]   and how you live in your city, how you treat money,
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.340]   how you're in relationships.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.220]   There's something about the big story of God
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.740]   that is deeply compelling,
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.940]   and we can find ourselves in it,
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.020]   but we have to understand it.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.980]   So I'm gonna try to just blaze through that,
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.460]   try to trace some big benchmarks, and we'll go from there.
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.980]   Now, I'm gonna do this with one question, okay?
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.500]   I'm gonna try to trace this big story
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.420]   with one question or one premise,
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.220]   and that is what does God want from us?
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.260]   What does God want from us?
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.620]   Or another way to put it is what is God after?
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500]   I think there's multiple answers to that question,
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.340]   by the way.
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.340]   I don't think I'm just gonna give you one answer
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.820]   that's the say-all, be-all,
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.300]   but I do think I wanna talk about one of them,
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.340]   and I think what God is after is a word
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.220]   that I'm just gonna say one word, and that is intimacy.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.140]   So if you're taking notes, write down intimacy.
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.500]   I think God is a God who is in pursuit of us
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.620]   in the garden mandate he gave us in Genesis
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.260]   to know us and be known by us, okay?
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.180]   He doesn't need us, but he wants us.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.220]   I know it's a weird way to think about it,
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.500]   but God has wants and desires.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.460]   He has a person, is he not?
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.220]   There's three persons in the Trinity.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.660]   And so he has wants and his desires,
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.180]   and so I think we do have to ask ourselves,
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.180]   according to the scriptures like David talked about,
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.780]   this is our beacon, this is our north star.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300]   What does God want from us?
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.580]   What is that story?
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.020]   Because let me just say, too, by the way,
[00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.980]   if you're not saturated and entrenched
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.020]   in the story of God, you will be captured by another story.
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.300]   You will be captured by another story
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   because here's another way to put it.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.820]   We are story creatures,
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.180]   meaning a story has to live inside of us.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.460]   It's impossible to be a human without a story.
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.580]   It's impossible, and when I say that,
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.140]   I mean just again, the meta-narrative,
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.340]   another term for it is the telos,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.140]   this vision, this aim of our life.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.060]   What are we going after?
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.020]   Why are we here?
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.860]   What's the point?
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.700]   All these big questions,
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.860]   even if we're not explicitly answering them,
[00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.820]   there's almost like a ticking clock inside of us
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.780]   pushing us towards our telos that we think is correct.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.820]   Now, all of them are wrong,
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.020]   except if we align with what it means to be human
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.300]   as an image bearer of God in pursuit of him,
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.100]   being known by him, and knowing him.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.780]   So if you don't know that story,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.020]   then you are captured by something else right now.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.340]   We're all captured by a story, let it be the right one,
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.540]   because all the other stories lead to destruction
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.220]   and death and decay and erosion in our hearts
[00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.220]   and our relationships in our city.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.140]   So if you have Genesis 2,
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.260]   we're gonna try to answer that question,
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.500]   if you have it open.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.340]   What does God want from us?
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.180]   Let's go down to verse 15.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.780]   "The Lord God took the man
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.020]   "and he put him in the Garden of Eden
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.580]   "to work it and to keep it."
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.540]   Oh, how'd you guys do that so fast?
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.740]   I didn't even tell you I was gonna read this text.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.060]   You guys are amazing, okay.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.900]   (congregation laughing)
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.540]   Watermark production is like ninjas, are they not?
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.380]   Like, it's like, guys, like, how'd you do that?
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.900]   Okay, and it's all fancy, oh man.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.820]   "And the Lord," okay, where was I?
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.380]   Verse 16, okay, like I said,
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.060]   we don't see this where I'm from, okay.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.060]   "The Lord God commanded the man,
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.080]   "saying, 'You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.180]   "'but of the tree of the knowledge and good and evil
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.020]   "'you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat it,
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.500]   "'you shall surely die.'"
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.220]   Okay, God creates these image bearers,
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.060]   these royal priests, these divine representatives of Him
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.060]   to reign and rule with Him, by the way.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.380]   What an amazing picture, by the way,
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.820]   what it means to be human.
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.980]   You're called to reign and rule alongside
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.540]   the creator of the universe, and He has said that so.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.740]   Anything lesser than that is too small.
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.620]   Anything lesser than that is too small.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.740]   Reign and rule alongside with your creator.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.300]   That's the call, that's the command.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.140]   And while He sets them in to do this job,
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.340]   He kind of gives them a couple little rules,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.660]   a couple little pointers.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.140]   And He says, "Everything in this garden is yours,"
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.100]   which by the way, it takes a little Hebrew to unpack this,
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.180]   but when it says, "You may surely eat
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.340]   "of everything in the garden,"
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.980]   that word eat in Hebrew is like redundant.
[00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.060]   It's actually almost saying it twice.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.300]   It's like saying, "You shall eat, eat, eat, eat."
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.740]   Like basically He's just saying, "Everything is yours."
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.080]   But when He says, "You should not touch the tree
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.300]   "of the knowledge of good and evil," that's singular.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.620]   By the way, do we not reverse that
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.420]   in our vision of God a lot of times?
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.980]   God's always saying, "No, no, no, no, no,
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.980]   "maybe a little, yes."
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.140]   Do you have the right picture of God
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.900]   informed by the scriptures?
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:48.880]   Because according to this God,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.060]   He is saying, "It's all yours."
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.180]   You can even go in Luke 15
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.980]   when the father is trying to play the picture of God as well
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.540]   and he says, "Everything that is mine is," what?
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.840]   "Yours."
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.900]   Do you have a stingy, crappy view of God?
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.820]   Can I say crappy in Dallas?
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.660]   Too late, okay.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.700]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.100]   Trying to, you know, cultural context.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.660]   Okay, do you have a stingy, terrible, small view of God
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.900]   or do you have a God who is lavish,
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.260]   who wants you to eat, who wants you to delight,
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.860]   who wants you to celebrate with restrictions, by the way?
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.740]   I'm not saying those aren't in there.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.740]   It's obviously there, like we just read.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.580]   Within His boundaries, within His markers,
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.740]   within how He's lined it up to work,
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.740]   He wants you to delight and celebrate
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.080]   and be blessed in His goodness.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.260]   That's why it's so amazing to follow Jesus
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.760]   because He actually wants to fill us with the most joy
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.020]   and it's only possible through Him.
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.860]   But let's look at that command.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.360]   "You may surely eat of every tree of the Garden of Eden,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.820]   "but you may surely not eat of the tree
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.420]   "of the knowledge of good and evil."
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.500]   Okay, now back up.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.260]   So they were just given a very big job to do, right?
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.180]   Go create and subdue and reign and rule with God.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.100]   One little pro tip here is a lot of us,
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.940]   we think we read Genesis and we think the whole earth
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.980]   was just like perfect and beautiful and amazing.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.420]   That's not really what the story is trying to say.
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.740]   The story is almost like a prototype was created.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.260]   God created this little pocket called the Garden of Eden.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.540]   He created order out of chaos.
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.360]   He created beauty.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.260]   He created goodness.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.460]   He puts the image bearers in it and then He says,
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.660]   "Look around.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.740]   "Now go make the rest of the world look like this."
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.000]   Are you tracking?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.860]   That was the job.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.640]   The job was, hey, here's a prototype.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.540]   Pay attention.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.780]   Now go make everything else look like this.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.860]   We're still doing that job today, are we not?
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.920]   Again, to go subdue, to reign and rule.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.140]   So He gives them that job.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.820]   Now, can we disagree that's a semi-big job?
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.040]   Go make the rest of the world look like Eden?
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.880]   So I don't know about you,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.460]   but this command seems a little strange to me
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.740]   because when I read that,
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.860]   what's one thing you would probably need
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.420]   to go do a job that massive?
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.400]   What?
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.240]   It's not a trick question.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.060]   We just read it.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.020]   You'd probably need the knowledge of good and evil, right?
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.340]   Or another way to put it is you just probably need
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.980]   to know what's right and wrong.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.660]   You need to know how to operate.
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.100]   But I remember growing up too in some church context,
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.420]   and I always heard this command,
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.620]   and I always thought it was like
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.820]   an eternal cat and mouse game.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.840]   Anyone else?
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.760]   Or is God just kind of trying to bait and switch them?
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.300]   Is this kind of like, another way to put it is,
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.340]   don't ever play God, by the way.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.820]   It never ends well in your brain.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.940]   But when I was like, well, if I was God, right?
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.940]   This is me as like eight years old or something.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.900]   I was like, well, if He didn't want Him to touch the tree,
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.060]   then what's the obvious solution?
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.380]   Don't put it there.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.500]   Don't put it there.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.940]   Why is it there, right?
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.380]   Unless, unless it's not arbitrary,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.460]   it's actually for a reason.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.860]   Might it be that that command
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.260]   from the very first page of Scripture
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.780]   is God inviting us into intimacy, right?
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.660]   See, if they don't eat of that tree,
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.480]   if they don't eat of it,
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.700]   it's not a trick question, by the way,
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.260]   what do they not have in and of themselves?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.140]   The knowledge of good and evil.
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.780]   Okay, so now if you're the humans
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.980]   tasked with this massive job,
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.980]   you don't in and of yourselves
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.900]   have the knowledge of good and evil,
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.860]   where are you going to find it?
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.680]   God, right?
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.980]   Anytime you're in a church setting, you ask the question,
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.940]   just say God or Jesus, you'll be right.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:44.380]   And if you're not, then like you say,
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.380]   well, I'm more holy, I said Jesus, okay?
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.180]   It's actually, it's not arbitrary.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.500]   This command from page one is not arbitrary.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.020]   It's God setting this tone or these two paths
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.940]   and inviting us to intimacy.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.820]   It's God from page one saying, I want to walk with you
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.540]   and I want you to lean so heavily on me
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.500]   in faith and trust and dependence
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.900]   that you come to me for what is right and wrong,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.780]   that I infuse in our deepest part of our relationship
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.420]   an actual spirit in you that informs you
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.300]   about what decisions you should make,
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.860]   how you should go about doing this
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.620]   and how you can do the job.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.660]   So it's an invitation or it's a fork in the road
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.900]   from page one saying, you can follow God,
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.100]   how you were created to operate and work
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.180]   and live under his design, or you can do it yourself,
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.860]   it never ends well.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.540]   You can be the king of your own life.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.260]   You can say, you know how sex works better.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.820]   You can say, you know how money works better.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.580]   You can say, you know how relationships work better.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.940]   It does not end well.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.100]   Spoiler alert, Genesis three,
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.820]   we'll get there in a second, okay?
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.740]   It does not end well, but it's a call to intimacy
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:47.580]   from page one.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.820]   So I want us to start there and then we'll keep going, okay?
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.660]   So he invites them into this,
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.580]   this vision of I want you to be co-creators
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.900]   and collaborators and laborers with me as your king
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.580]   underneath me, commissioned out to be image bearers,
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.940]   but don't touch this tree
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.780]   because I want it to be in relationship with you.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.940]   I don't want you to be able to do it without me.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.340]   But spoiler alert, did they eat or not eat?
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.180]   They ate.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.740]   They ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.580]   And again, so many of us,
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.260]   that's the path maybe we're on right now.
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.900]   I know better.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.300]   And some of us, we need a season to totally play that out.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.380]   Do we not?
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.540]   Some of us, we don't want to pay attention
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.940]   until that just ends in the dumps,
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.780]   till that just ends in a place of us feeling so eroded,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.460]   so corroded in our souls, so at a place of,
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.460]   man, this does not end well.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.780]   But by the way, Jesus is there to meet you, is he not?
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.260]   Every time, every time.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.820]   And so there's this invitation, they eat the tree,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.700]   and then in a second, everything fractures.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.820]   Their humanness, the world,
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.140]   their relationship with God, everything breaks.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.540]   Sin is like a disease that comes in
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.500]   and breaks and fractures every part,
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.900]   our relationship with God, our relationship to the earth,
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.140]   and our relationship to ourselves,
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.540]   and our relationship to each other.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.100]   It breaks everything.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.140]   Now, this is a fun little trivia for you.
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.460]   It says immediately after that,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.340]   God kind of puts some curses and says some things
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.060]   and talks, you know, it gets a little serious.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.900]   And then he kicks them out
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.420]   a particular direction in the garden.
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.660]   Do you know what direction that is?
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.220]   It's not a true question, there's only four options, right?
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.380]   Northwest, south, and east.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.300]   Yes, anyone?
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.740]   It's a famous Steinbeck novel, I haven't read it,
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.580]   I went to public school, but I heard it's good.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.700]   What is it, east, there we go, east of Eden.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.980]   It says he kicks them out east.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.820]   Now, why is this important?
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.900]   Because that's actually a breadcrumb
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.220]   that keeps going in the scriptures
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.180]   farther and farther down the road.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.300]   The next chapter, Lot, I mean, sorry,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.500]   Cain kills his brother Abel,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.340]   what direction does it say he kicked him out,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.020]   or I mean banished him?
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.780]   East, Lot departs from Abraham
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.020]   the minute they have a little bit of tension,
[00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.660]   and it's clearly he's the choice of disobedience
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.580]   in that story, what direction does he go?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.780]   East, you get to Genesis 11,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.180]   the peak story of all human pride and rebellion.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.020]   We can, it's like the collective version of Genesis 3.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.940]   We can do it on our own, we can build a tower to heaven,
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.300]   we can do it ourselves, and it says they migrated where?
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.460]   The east, it says if east,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.660]   according to the writer of Genesis,
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.300]   is almost this metaphor of this picture
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.700]   of what it looks to spiral downwards
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.100]   and away from intimacy with your creator,
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.900]   from the garden, from walking with him,
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.220]   from being with him.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.340]   East, if we continue to make those choices,
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.500]   it just gets worse and worse and worse,
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.500]   and we keep going the same direction.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.620]   Now, right after Tower of Babel,
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.180]   we meet a fun figure named who?
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.940]   Abram, and then Abraham,
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.380]   he takes up a lot more of the Bible,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.500]   but he's one of these first figures
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.060]   where he gets called by God,
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:24.300]   and he says yes to the relationship.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.300]   He says yes to his way of how it's going to line up,
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.740]   and he trusts him, he has faith and dependency,
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.140]   which again is the heart of intimacy,
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.900]   and by the way, when it says he calls Abraham,
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.660]   what direction does Abraham go?
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.900]   West, he's going back towards the garden,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.420]   the place that God wanted to walk with his people,
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.980]   and I nerd out on this stuff, so there's a lot more,
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.060]   but I'll give you one or two more.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.500]   I think later down in the Torah,
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.020]   when God is giving Moses instructions
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.380]   to how to build the tabernacle,
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.700]   which by the way, the tabernacle is,
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.420]   he specifically gives him instructions to say,
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.860]   put a bunch of fruit in there,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.100]   put a bunch of statues of animals,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.460]   put a bunch of trees and foliage,
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.060]   what is he trying to represent the tabernacle as?
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.540]   The Garden of Eden, right?
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.380]   And he says specifically, put the entrance to the temple
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.540]   on the east side of the temple,
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.020]   so when you're walking in, you're going what direction?
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.980]   West, back towards meeting with God.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.380]   It's as if God, from the very page of Scripture,
[00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.740]   all the way down even through the curse,
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.460]   is saying, I want to call you back.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.740]   Stop going east.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.540]   Stop thinking you can do it on your own.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.060]   He wants to call us back,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.980]   and he's continually calling us back.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.660]   And so this first stage of the Bible
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.500]   is kind of what we talked about,
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.620]   and it goes all the way to the end
[00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.740]   of the first five books of the Bible,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.740]   which is what we call the Torah.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.060]   Can you guys say Torah?
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.900]   Torah.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.820]   Or if you're really saying it Hebrew,
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.740]   you can kind of say it with a loogie,
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.140]   just don't spit on the person in front of you.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.940]   Torah, you know, cough on someone,
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.140]   and especially now, that's dangerous.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.980]   Okay.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.540]   Woo, nevermind, don't do that.
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.260]   The first five books of the Bible
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.300]   are kind of seen as this foundational,
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.540]   these pillars, documents to the people of Israel,
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.300]   to the community, both for ethics and government
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.860]   and politics, but also the way to live and sexuality.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.420]   It was kind of this full encompassing,
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.580]   this is how to live, this is how to be human,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.940]   for the early ancient Near East people of Israel, okay?
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.300]   And the nation of God that God called them in that,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.180]   in the promise of Abraham.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.060]   Now, the Torah kind of has its own little thesis, right?
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.740]   What starts to show up later in the books
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.660]   is this common way that God begins to relate to his people
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:14.940]   in a particular covenant.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.180]   It's the Mosaic Covenant, right?
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.580]   And God, hundreds of times in the Torah, by the way,
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.580]   says this thing where he basically goes,
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.380]   this is essentially me summarizing the Mosaic Covenant.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.820]   If you do X, I will what?
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.140]   Starts with a B.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.980]   Bless you.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.220]   And if you don't do X, I will do what?
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.500]   Starts with a C.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.420]   Curse you.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.260]   And so hundreds of times, this formula
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.380]   almost starts to play out in Torah,
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.620]   where God is saying, if you live this way,
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   if you do what I've asked you, if you live in this way,
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.620]   if you treat sexuality this way, money this way, et cetera,
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.140]   I will bless you, it'll go well for you.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.500]   By the way, that's a fun phrase I'm saying
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.800]   to my kids 100 times a day.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.660]   If you do this, it'll go well for you.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.900]   Please do not do this, okay?
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.700]   And if you don't, I will curse you.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.020]   Now, a curse, again, we think of that
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.620]   as something really serious.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.500]   It's really serious, but you will live
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.260]   with the ramifications of that decision.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.560]   It will erode itself, right?
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.980]   It will not go well for you.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.140]   Now, we hear the Mosaic Covenant, and a lot of us,
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.500]   especially if we're in kind of a Western
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.580]   evangelical context, a lot of us cringe, right?
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.940]   'Cause that sounds just like super law, right?
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.780]   We're like, oh, that just sounds like no grace,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.620]   it sounds like you gotta earn your way to heaven, et cetera.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.300]   No, we are certainly outside of that covenant,
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.020]   and I'm gonna get to that in a minute,
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.820]   but can we disagree?
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.140]   God would never give something to his people
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.500]   that was not for their good, right?
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.500]   So what's going on there?
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.060]   I think a lot of us, we fumble with the law.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.500]   We don't know exactly what's going on.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.900]   What I would say is this, is it's actually not God
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.940]   arbitrarily not doing grace, but it's actually a way
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.820]   in which he's trying to relate to his people
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.700]   to lead them to intimacy, okay?
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.380]   Now, I know that's hard to think about.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.620]   An illustration I think about is,
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.420]   all of us were raised on Torah obedience,
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.200]   were we not, early on?
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   Early on?
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.620]   Like, so I have a couple children.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.780]   I think they're even here, or they were here earlier.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.700]   You never know, they probably cried,
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.180]   and they gotta bounce, they only last for five minutes.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.660]   But our youngest right now, like, right?
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.060]   So the earliest times I can remember myself,
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.140]   or also even administering kind of Torah obedience,
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.060]   like, hey, if you go well, I'll bless you.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.180]   You get a Skittle, you get a Snickers,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.820]   you get a little candy, you get a cookie, whatever,
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.300]   and if you don't, I'll curse you, you don't get that.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.260]   Right, that's essentially what it is.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.500]   The earliest time I can remember that is, you know,
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.100]   like, right now we're doing it.
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.300]   It's like potty training, coming when we say come,
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.340]   and, you know, listening when we say no.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.740]   Now, that is actually meant to, that's normal and fine,
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.620]   meaning like that's actually normal at that age,
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.980]   but where it becomes weird is if Torah obedience
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.740]   is the point the whole time.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.580]   Track with me here.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.740]   So let's say Lucy, our two-year-old,
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.820]   that's fine and normal now to say,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.660]   hey, if you go to the bathroom,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.540]   or if you go potty, you get a Skittle.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:38.700]   Here you go, right?
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.300]   That's normal, and maybe if you're not a parent,
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.140]   you're like, that's still weird, okay.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.180]   But let's say she's like, I don't know, 16 or something,
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.300]   and coming home from a weekend,
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.140]   or something with friends, or something like that,
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.140]   and we go, hey, little Lucy, if you go potty,
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.300]   I'll give you a Skittle.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.340]   (congregation laughing)
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.900]   You'd be like, that's weird, that's weird.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.460]   Now, did anything change that I said to her at two
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.740]   that I did at 16?
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.740]   No, that's the problem, that's the problem, right?
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.380]   At two, Torah obedience is actually
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.020]   how you lead someone to what?
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.300]   To intimacy, right?
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.860]   When someone is older, when they're 16, when they're 18,
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.540]   when they're a young adult, and you no longer have them
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.900]   under the authority of your home,
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.980]   they are maybe obeying, or honoring you,
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.220]   as another way to put it,
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.780]   out of the love of the relationship,
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.700]   and hopefully they're going to the bathroom
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.100]   on their own without Skittles as well, right?
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.620]   But whether it's just like honoring you,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.620]   and how they talk to you, or whatever it is,
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.180]   Torah obedience is not there anymore.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.620]   It's meant to push, it's like a push to intimacy.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.900]   Are you tracking?
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.580]   That's actually why God started to get so upset at Israel,
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.380]   because they just wanted to stay there.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.500]   He's like, you're not getting the point.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.540]   You're not getting the point.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.540]   I wanna take you farther, I wanna take you deeper,
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.780]   I want to lead you to intimacy.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.300]   And by the way, there's even little breadcrumbs
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.900]   in the Torah as well, where it's very obvious,
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.700]   even with Moses dying outside the promised land,
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.740]   that obviously like this mechanism
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.380]   cannot be the entire thing.
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.980]   Something greater has to happen.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.500]   It never fully gets to the place
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.500]   of what it's trying to go for.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.780]   And as it says later in the New Testament,
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.740]   it's not the problem with the law, it's the problem with us.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.300]   We wanna stay in it.
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.060]   We actually like it, we wanna be two year olds forever.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.900]   God wants to actually take you into full intimacy.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.660]   So then you go from Torah to the rest of the Tanakh,
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.980]   which is another Hebrew word for the rest
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.060]   of the scriptures, essentially.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.220]   And then this is where it gets interesting,
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.820]   because then you start to see all these books
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.660]   and all these writers start to wrestle
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.780]   with this dynamic problem we're kind of talking about
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.380]   right now, which by the way, can I just say,
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.460]   one of the things that really bothers me
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.820]   is when we read our Bible, we kind of read it flat.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.260]   Like we read it like an instruction manual.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.100]   Again, it's a story, it has an arc.
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.460]   The authors are talking to each other.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.260]   They're wrestling with problems.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.900]   They're wrestling with what's going on.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.620]   They're wrestling with the tradition.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.220]   So you get something like Psalm 51,
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.260]   where David just committed adultery
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.140]   and then had the guy murdered to cover it up,
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.740]   decently sized sin, not like I'm ranking him or anything,
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.740]   but pretty large.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:02.300]   And in Psalm 51, it's his Psalm of repentance.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   And what does he say?
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:04.940]   He gets down to the bottom of that Psalm and he says,
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.660]   "God, in his apology, in his repentance to God,
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.900]   "if you wanted burnt offerings and sacrifices, Yahweh,
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.820]   "I would give them to you.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.940]   "But what you truly want is what?"
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.860]   Depending on your translation,
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.620]   a broken and contrite heart.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.460]   Now that sounds cute, put it on a coffee cup,
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.820]   but why is that actually very weird?
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.980]   Why is that weird?
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.660]   God, if you wanted burnt offerings and sacrifices,
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.500]   I would give them to you.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.540]   Why is that, like, why does that make no sense?
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.060]   That's exactly what God commanded.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.060]   Is it not?
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.900]   Where?
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.860]   In the Torah.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.460]   But it's as if David is a living human being
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.700]   who understands what?
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.380]   That the Torah is actually taking us
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.740]   and pushing us somewhere.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.140]   And so in this point in the story,
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.860]   he's realizing this problem of like,
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.900]   God, this is not ultimately what you want.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.420]   This is meant to push to something greater.
[00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.260]   And what you truly want, as he says it,
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.460]   a broken and contrite heart.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.300]   It's almost saying like,
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.420]   God, if you wanted Torah, I would give it to you.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.420]   But what you truly want is intimacy.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.140]   If you wanted Torah, I would give it to you,
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.100]   but what you want is intimacy.
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.140]   This is all over, by the way,
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.500]   in the rest of the Hebrew scriptures.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   Job, same thing.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.660]   Job, the book of Job opens with him giving sacrifices
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.980]   for sins his children might commit in the future.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.940]   Is anyone that holy?
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.020]   Not me.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.980]   Like he's guessing what sins they'll give.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.140]   And he's like, I'm just gonna be so Torah obedient,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.300]   I'm gonna kind of get in the DeLorean,
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.820]   go in the future, you know what I mean?
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.780]   Back to the future, shout out.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.420]   Okay, favorite movie of all time.
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.460]   Don't need to get into it, I nerd out.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.860]   Anyways, the third one was, sucked.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.700]   Okay.
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.380]   Where was I at?
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.460]   Job, that's right, Job.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.100]   So Job, okay, so he starts giving like,
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.540]   he starts sacrificing for sins his kids might commit.
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.980]   That's the, what I'm trying to say
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.820]   is that's the epitome of Torah obedience.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.500]   The epitome.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.140]   But yet through the trials, through the wrestling,
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.980]   through all of the boils and the diseases
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.380]   and all the hard stuff and deaths
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.860]   and just a brutal suffering life,
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.540]   he starts to begin to realize what?
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.780]   Oh, God does not relate to me in Torah obedience.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.060]   God is not trying to talk to me
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.460]   or commune with me in Torah obedience.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.100]   And so you get to the end of the book
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.700]   and it kind of has this Job prayer
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.020]   where he's kind of like reflecting again
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.780]   on everything that had just happened.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.580]   And he says at the very end,
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.180]   he basically said, "My whole life, God, I have what?
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.940]   "I have heard you.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.060]   "I have heard of you."
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.420]   And then it goes into the next verse.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.940]   "But today for the first time, I what?
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.140]   "See you."
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.020]   Again, for my whole life, I've heard of you.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:25.860]   I've heard of the rules.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.740]   I've heard of the things.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.860]   I've heard of all the Christian stuff I have to do.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.700]   But for my first time in my life,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.780]   through all of this, you have met me.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.660]   You have met me.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.140]   I see you.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.180]   That's intimacy.
[00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.540]   God wants that for you.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.500]   He wants that for you.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.540]   He wants to meet you today.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.540]   Whether you love the Lord now
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.140]   or you've never even become a Christian,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.900]   today he wants to go deeper with you.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.540]   He wants to go deeper with you.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.820]   Micah 6, 8, I'll read one last one for time's sake.
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.020]   Even my Bible, by the way,
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.860]   like my subtitle on this text
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.500]   is even the question that we just asked in Genesis.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.340]   You probably can't see this,
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.900]   but it says, "What does the Lord require?"
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.860]   That's not scripture
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.100]   because that's the translators putting that there.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.340]   But it's, "What does the Lord require?"
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.180]   And then Micah 6, 8,
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.460]   "Wrestling with this same problem,"
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.620]   'cause it's a dynamic problem
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.580]   that they're trying to wrestle with.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.780]   Man, this can't be it.
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.140]   Says this, verse six,
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.580]   "With what shall I come before the Lord
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.460]   "and bow myself before God on high?
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.280]   "Shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.780]   "with calves a year old?"
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.840]   Uh-oh.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.140]   "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.920]   "or with 10,000s of rivers of oil?
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.420]   "Or shall I give my firstborn
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.440]   "for the transgression of my sin
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.340]   "or the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.660]   So he's saying just, man,
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.740]   if God wants one calf, why not give a thousand?
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.740]   Then it will be extra holy.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.940]   He's just drawing everything out
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.020]   to its logical conclusion, right?
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.540]   If God wants this, then make it more pure.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.620]   If God wants this, make it more.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.000]   Verse eight, he pivots.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.360]   "Know, he has told you, oh man,
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.080]   "what is truly good,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.840]   "and what does the Lord require of you?
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.120]   "But to do justice, love kindness,
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.340]   "and walk humbly with your God."
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.740]   Again, Torah, Torah, Torah.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.980]   No, no, no, walking, intimacy.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.460]   Walking, by the way, in the whole scripture
[00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.140]   is just a euphemism for connection
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.380]   and relationship with God.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.940]   All the people who are giants in the face
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.900]   that they walked with God.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.120]   Intimacy.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.420]   God is calling us to this place.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.300]   Now, again, this part in the story,
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.500]   what's fascinating is you start to see
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.180]   all these writers wrestle with the problem,
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.680]   but they know the solution's not here yet.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.740]   Are you tracking?
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.660]   So they're kind of saying like,
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.900]   I feel pushed in by this side
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.900]   of this is not all that God wants for us.
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.980]   God has to do something greater and deeper,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.300]   but then push in by this side of it's not happening yet.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.380]   It's not here yet.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.380]   You see Jeremiah and Ezekiel and the prophets
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.420]   wrestle with this problem and say,
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.100]   a new covenant has to happen.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:36.940]   A new thing.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.420]   God has to do a new thing.
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.300]   And then we get to the very end of the Old Testament
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.500]   and we open up what act of the play?
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.820]   The New Testament, which who shows up?
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.820]   Again, I gave you the tip.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.660]   Any question?
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.480]   Who do you say?
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.320]   Jesus.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.980]   Jesus shows up.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.060]   And right from the very first moment,
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.740]   it's this explosion of God actually putting on human flesh
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.220]   to walk with us.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.540]   Think about the intimacy there.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.380]   John chapter one says,
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.580]   "The word became flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.540]   That word dwelt in Greek is the word tabernacle.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.100]   He tabernacled among us.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.260]   He pitched his tent in your backyard.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.660]   That's my translation, okay?
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.920]   He pitched his tent among you.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.540]   Whatever crap you're going through,
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.700]   whether it's something done against you,
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:18.700]   whether it's something you've done,
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.700]   whether the shame you're feeling,
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.060]   do you believe that God is right next to you in a tent?
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.180]   He's camping with you.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.120]   You are not alone.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.160]   The question is, have you reached out to him?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.060]   Are you dwelling with him?
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.900]   Are you talking with him?
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.300]   Are you communion with him?
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.560]   You are not alone.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.320]   I want you to hear that in whatever you are going through.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.060]   And again, Jesus himself as a dynamic living person
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.640]   wrestles or at least talks about this problem.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.860]   You get into the Sermon on the Mount
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.400]   and he's in direct conversation with this problem.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.620]   Jesus starts to say things in the Sermon on the Mount
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.660]   of you have heard it said, you shall not, what?
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.600]   Commit adultery.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.460]   But I say, if you even look at a lust,
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.940]   if you even look at a woman with lust in your heart,
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.260]   you have already committed adultery.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:02.820]   Jesus is saying, hey, you've heard it said,
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.520]   Torah, Torah, Torah, but today, new thing, intimacy.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.020]   That's what I want.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.760]   That's what I want.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.800]   So it's constantly this thread of invitation
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.980]   of God keeps coming to us farther and deeper
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.260]   to invite us into relationship with him
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.700]   and to be known by him and know him
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.700]   is the greatest thing of all.
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.600]   That's what he wants for you and with you.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.820]   End with a couple of illustrations
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.260]   and then I'll close.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.580]   God does this and shows up in Jesus
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.380]   and it's powerful and it's amazing.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.860]   And then I'll go to two stories in a second.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.320]   But one thing I just thought of actually,
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.700]   let me take a little tangent on,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.660]   is think of the scriptures almost like a staircase, okay?
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.020]   Where if you think about it, every act of the play,
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.740]   God is kind of getting deeper
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.360]   or more intimate with his people.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.080]   By the way, amidst rebellion
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.360]   and us pushing back every single time.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.460]   So after the curse, you have God saying,
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.180]   I want to dwell with my people.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.020]   So then he what?
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.100]   He commissions the tabernacle and the temple system
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.420]   so that he can dwell with them.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.620]   He didn't have to do that.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.820]   Did he have to do that?
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.580]   No, but he wanted to, his presence,
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.360]   he wanted to dwell with his people.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.660]   Now, were they awesome or not awesome, essentially?
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.500]   Not awesome, right?
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.320]   They rebelled.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.340]   It says they were stiff-necked and wicked people.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.580]   What a, I never want to be called that, okay?
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.440]   But the scriptures does call us that,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.700]   so we got to sit in that.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.100]   Stiff-necked and wicked people.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.220]   God wants to be with them,
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.900]   and instead of them saying, oh yes, this is so awesome,
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.860]   God, the creator of the universe,
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.780]   is making a way to dwell with us again.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:33.660]   Amidst our sin and our rebellion,
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.860]   they still just push back, push back.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.660]   They go worship false idols and other nations
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.580]   and all these different types of things.
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.740]   They don't honor God, his commandments,
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.900]   his covenants, et cetera.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.140]   But God keeps pushing.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.700]   It's almost like, think of the scriptures
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.540]   as a story of dissent.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.660]   That God is actually,
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.980]   and another thing that does to you too
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.760]   is he's the momentum, he's the inertia.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.420]   It does not have anything to do with you and what you do.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.080]   It's actually about, you only get to respond.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.940]   You only get to respond.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:00.980]   God is moving.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:02.700]   God is not just, he is sitting on a throne,
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:03.900]   but I wasn't gonna say he's just sitting on the couch
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.740]   or something like that.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.580]   He's not just sitting there, vegging out.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.380]   He is moving towards us.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.980]   Your job is to respond, not initiate.
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.140]   So he's descending, and you have God the father
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:17.500]   in the temple, dwelling with us for hundreds of years,
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.380]   and they keep resisting, keep resisting, keep resisting.
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.420]   You would think finally at that time,
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.820]   you would finally say, okay, nevermind, peace out,
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.600]   I'm done, like I'm done.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.440]   But what does he do?
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.260]   He doesn't do that.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.160]   Instead, his answer, his answer to that problem of like,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.440]   man, they're just wicked and rebellious
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.320]   is to actually always go deeper.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.840]   So then the next act of the play, he shows up what?
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.180]   With skin on.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.640]   He shows up with flesh.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.760]   So he's like, I'm no longer gonna just live
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.720]   in this temple thing.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.920]   I'm gonna become one of you.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.720]   I'm gonna become one of you.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.000]   And again, do you think at that point,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.080]   you'd be like, yes, thank you, Lord, you're amazing.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.000]   They kill him.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.200]   They kill him.
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.940]   They crucify the Messiah, Jesus.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.340]   They kill him.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.340]   Kind of like, we don't want you here.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.220]   And so you think finally, once you get killed,
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.660]   you'd be like, I'm done, I'm out.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.860]   What's he do?
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.380]   Next act of the play, the book of Acts.
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.860]   I'm going deeper.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:10.860]   He says, I'm gonna go deeper.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.780]   I'm going to not only dwell with skin on now,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.220]   I'm going to dwell inside of them.
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.620]   They can't get rid of me now.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:20.100]   I'm gonna dwell inside of them.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:20.940]   Inside of them.
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.040]   So it goes God in temple, God in flesh, God inside of them.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.080]   And that's not the end of the story.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.280]   You get all the way down to Revelation 21 and 22.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.160]   And it says that heaven and earth will be put back together
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.520]   and God will become our very dwelling place.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.520]   So then it reversed this, it's like inception style.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.780]   And we now dwell in him.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.000]   That's it.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.760]   Are you tracking that story?
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.120]   That story is insane.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.960]   Right?
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.800]   It's amazing.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.340]   Thank you, amen.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.860]   It's incredible.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.040]   And that's what God is inviting you to.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.480]   He's inviting you to his great grand story
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.680]   that he is descending towards you.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.440]   He is coming after you.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.400]   He is pursuing you.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.240]   I love that.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.080]   What is it?
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.000]   Psalm 23, where it says that goodness and mercy
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.140]   will follow me all the days of my life.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.720]   Again, in the Hebrew, that's a little bit more like chase.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.480]   He's not following, he is chasing.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.560]   You're about to get tackled with goodness and mercy.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.440]   I want to get tackled by goodness and mercy.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.600]   And God's offering that.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.660]   He's offering that to you right now in this place.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.240]   And so I'll end with one story for time's sake.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.320]   I had a couple more, but it just goes on.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.140]   Okay.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.120]   ADHD, anyone?
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.940]   Can you tell?
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.780]   Anyways.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.680]   So we've got a few of you, shout outs.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.240]   We'll do a support group after.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.740]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.140]   Luke 24.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.200]   God, Jesus dies, resurrects.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.680]   Okay, he resurrects.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   And then this is like the most fascinating story.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:45.820]   I don't hear it preached on very often,
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.580]   but it's very interesting and fascinating.
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.640]   So God resurrects, Jesus resurrects, excuse me.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.480]   And then it says he comes alongside these two guys.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.560]   Now they don't recognize him.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.520]   I don't know if there just wasn't like
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.000]   Facebook profile pictures back then or what,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.520]   or he changed it a little.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.360]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.100]   They don't recognize him, but he sees they're bummed out.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.420]   So he kind of says, "Hey guys, why are you guys bummed out?"
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.240]   And they rebuke him, which by the way,
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   never a good idea to rebuke Jesus, amen?
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.520]   They kind of go, they're kind of like,
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.880]   "Bro, what are you talking about?"
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   And they say, "Didn't you just see a couple of days ago
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.020]   "how Jesus of Nazareth, like we followed him for three years
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.220]   "and then he just got crucified under the Roman empire."
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.480]   Which by the way, even though we have all these crosses
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.120]   and we worship Jesus on a cross,
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.760]   do you realize in the first century,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.840]   a man you followed that was put on a Roman execution device,
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.040]   you just lost and wasted three years of your life.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.280]   Sit in that.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.080]   You wasted three years of your life.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.200]   They felt like they lost.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.080]   So three years of that and they just are saying,
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.040]   like they don't know it's Jesus,
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.200]   but they're saying to Jesus,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.040]   "Like what are you talking about?
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.280]   "We just wasted three years of our lives, we lost.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.080]   "This isn't the guy, this isn't the guy."
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.080]   And then it says Jesus rebukes them back,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   which that's a good idea.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.040]   You know, Jesus can rebuke us.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.740]   And it says he, this is crazy.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.700]   It says he begins from Moses all the way to the prophets,
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.440]   beginning to describe how this had to have happened,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.320]   they just weren't paying attention.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.440]   Okay, do you know Moses to the prophets, by the way,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.800]   is pretty much a euphemism for the whole Bible?
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.280]   Like they didn't have a New Testament yet.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.040]   The Torah is Moses, first five books of the Bible,
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.100]   and outside of the wisdom literature,
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.480]   the prophets is pretty much everything else.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.960]   It's basically Jesus.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.600]   Right when they say that, he just basically,
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.720]   it says Jesus opens up his Bible
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.600]   and goes from page one to the last page.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.800]   I don't even know how long that would have taken,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.220]   but it doesn't take long 'cause they've only, yeah.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.840]   Anyways, opens up the whole Bible
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.200]   describing how this was supposed to happen.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.720]   You missed it.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.660]   You weren't paying attention.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.960]   You weren't reading close enough,
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.060]   which by the way, read closely.
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.800]   Can we be people that read closely?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.640]   Read closely, be saturated in the word, sit in the word,
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.160]   'cause he's communicating to us.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.660]   But here's what's crazy about that story.
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.620]   Jesus himself, the uppercase word,
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.840]   starts unpacking the entire lowercase word.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.160]   And guess what?
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.640]   Nothing happens.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.880]   Nothing happens.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.920]   Like literally the next sentence is like five hours
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.760]   later that day.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.720]   It says later that day, they were going to the house.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.200]   Can we just sit and how ridiculous that is?
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.800]   Like I would expect if Jesus
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.880]   is my personal Bible study partner
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.000]   that I would have heavens open up
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and there'd be people singing.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.840]   Right?
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.680]   So many of us, we wish that.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.240]   If Jesus could just show up in my room
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.880]   and give me all the answers, give me all the stuff, right?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.720]   But you know what's crazy?
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.560]   Nothing happens.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.380]   And then it gets even weirder.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.880]   Later that day, they go to his house
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.800]   or they go to their house
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.520]   and they ask Jesus to stay for a meal.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.560]   And then it says, Jesus sits down,
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.680]   breaks bread with them.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.040]   And in an instant, their eyes were opened.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.640]   That makes no sense.
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.080]   So over here, Jesus is unpacking
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.800]   the entire scriptures to them.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.820]   Nothing happens.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.620]   Over here, he breaks the Chick-fil-A.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.560]   That is a strange story.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.280]   Can we first admit that?
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.120]   Unless what?
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.720]   Unless Jesus is trying to tell us something.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.240]   Again, I think so many of us,
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.620]   what that is, I think it's almost too,
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.480]   it's like the way that we like to operate with God
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.640]   and the way that God wants to operate with us.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.200]   See, we wanna operate with God.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.040]   Jesus, just give me all the answers.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.400]   Give me all the answers.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.800]   He says, my translation is shut up, sit with me.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.100]   Be quiet and sit with me.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.040]   I wanna eat with you.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.020]   I wanna dine with you.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.440]   Notice how they get revelation.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.240]   Like maybe God's actually blocking revelation
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.920]   and epiphany from you because you just want the answers.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.760]   You haven't sat with him.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.240]   So many of us, we want,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.120]   another way to think about it is we almost want Jesus
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.800]   to give us all the answers so that we can leave him.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.440]   'Cause when you get all the answers,
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.540]   who do you not need anymore?
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.040]   That sounds a lot like the knowledge of tree
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.880]   of good and evil, doesn't it?
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.560]   Same thing, same point.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.140]   But God's saying, that's not how I operate.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.380]   You can keep eating of that fruit.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.760]   You can keep eating of that tree,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.760]   but that's not how I operate.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.160]   How I operate is I want to feast with you.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   I want to sit at a table with you.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.680]   I want to dine with you.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.360]   And now notice, they're not pitted against each other.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.840]   It actually says, they say, when they have the epiphany,
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.040]   it says, "Did our hearts not burn within us
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.880]   "as he unpacked the scriptures to us back on the path?"
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.700]   So they go together.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.560]   You get the scriptures and you get revelation
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.120]   by sitting at the table with Jesus.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.000]   That's the invitation today.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.560]   Have you sat at the table with him?
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.760]   Do you dine with him?
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.360]   Do you feast with him?
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.800]   I don't know what kind of stories are in this room,
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.040]   but whether it can be, you know,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.320]   you're struggling with shame and guilt and pain
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.560]   from, you know, sleeping with your boyfriend
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.680]   or your girlfriend and just feeling like,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.920]   ah, this doesn't feel right.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.880]   It can be maybe an abortion you've had in the past.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.140]   It can maybe even abortion you've scheduled in the future.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.120]   It can maybe be even a level of perfection
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.360]   that you struggle with, but it's weighing you down
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.600]   because you're putting your identity in it.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.440]   Whatever it is in this room,
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   God is saying, I don't care, just sit with me.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.480]   Sit with me.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.640]   The goal from page one is still the same goal.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:37.120]   I want to know you and I wanna be known by you.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.600]   And that's the invitation, that you would taste
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.080]   and see that the Lord is good.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.640]   And it says in 2 Corinthians, I don't know where,
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:46.640]   somewhere three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   somewhere in there.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.080]   It's in, I'm gonna butcher it too,
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.120]   but it's essentially the summary of God saying,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.200]   Paul saying, when we sit at the feet of Jesus
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.920]   and we behold him, we actually become more and more like him
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.100]   and we begin to emanate ourselves.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.320]   Like Moses in the Old Testament,
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.200]   when he sat at the face up on the mountain,
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.440]   he came down glowing.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.880]   Might we be people who go into our city,
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.520]   who go into our marriages, who go into our lives,
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.400]   glowing because we've sat at the table with Jesus.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.040]   Our world needs a lot more glowing people, does it not?
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.400]   More glow, more love, more gentleness, more patience,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.680]   more goodness, more beauty.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.640]   And so that's the invitation for you tonight, today.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.360]   Wherever you're at, might we just sit
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.640]   at the table with Jesus?
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.080]   Let me pray for you.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:37.080]   Jesus, we thank you for who you are.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.680]   We thank you for what you're doing right now
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.760]   in this space and in this moment.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.560]   Lord, I just pray for a room this size,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.200]   there's a million stories going on right now,
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.480]   a million trajectories, people all over the map.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.280]   But the best part is you just ask us to sit with you.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.600]   So Lord, let us hear that invitation today
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.960]   that you want to feast with us.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.600]   You want to dine with us.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.080]   And what better invitation than getting an invitation
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.040]   from the King of the universe?
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.480]   Let us be humbled by the fact that we have even said no
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.520]   to that invitation and how we've lived
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   and how we've acted and how we've spoke.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.760]   Lord, we thank you for who you are.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.680]   I thank you for this room.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.680]   And Lord, let us just be people that say yes,
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.560]   every day, every moment, every year.
