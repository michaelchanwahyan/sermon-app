1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:19,320
 - All right, well, here we go.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,340
 Welcome everyone that is tuning in from around the country.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,520
 We are so excited.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,660
 Like JD already said, we're kicking off a brand new series.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,580
 I've got some friends that are hanging out with me

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,220
 that you'll probably see me interacting with

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,400
 as we dive in and kick off this series called Fact Check,

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,920
 which is a look at some of the tough questions

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,320
 facing Christianity and just answering

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,040
 some of the key objections people have

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,200
 as it relates to faith.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,680
 How we doing guys?

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440
 Everyone have a good Easter?

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,540
 Okay, so here, let me bring you guys

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,600
 and everyone listening into kind of Easter world

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,780
 for me as just a parent with young kids.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,160
 This past weekend celebrated Easter, you know,

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,800
 quarantine style, and my four year old son

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,640
 was introduced for the very first time to the Easter bunny.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,580
 Like we probably talked about it, but you know,

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,920
 the older they get, the more they're like,

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,360
 oh yeah, I can kind of remember that now.

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,440
 And the Easter bunny, you know,

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,120
 there's these different holiday mascots.

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,660
 Like you got Santa Claus, you got the leprechaun

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,400
 for St. Patrick's day, you got Cupid for Valentine's day.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,120
 You got, I would put the tooth fairy kind of in that,

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,280
 even though it's not a holiday mascot, if you will.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,580
 But of all of them, probably the more interesting

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,500
 and humorous to me is the Easter bunny.

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,640
 And I was realizing this as I was talking

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
 with my four year old who just has questions like,

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 man, there's a bunny who brings us baskets of toys

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,760
 and he leaves them right where Santa Claus left them

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,780
 on the fireplace.

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,620
 How does he carry?

38
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,080
 'Cause he doesn't think bunny, like we all think

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,400
 like bugs bunny or a big bunny that's like a fake bunny.

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,760
 He thinks like an actual rabbit.

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,800
 And he's like bunnies, they can't really lift things

42
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,640
 and carry things.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,240
 Like how does he carry all that to every kid out there?

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,620
 And like, how big is this bunny?

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,020
 That had to be a huge bunny.

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,540
 And I'm trying to figure out like,

47
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,900
 how would you, how do you answer that question?

48
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,640
 You're like, he's like, he's like your size of your mom

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,340
 because his mom's the Easter bunny.

50
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,600
 And that's about the size that he is.

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,860
 And he's asking questions

52
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,320
 that are really understandable questions.

53
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,500
 Like, why does he bring eggs?

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,640
 Like what do bunnies have to do with eggs?

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,980
 They don't lay eggs.

56
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,460
 And it's like, yeah, he brings eggs 'cause yeah,

57
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,900
 I don't really know why he brings eggs.

58
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,420
 Like you think about it, it's like a very,

59
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,400
 like so many of the traditions around this are just funny

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,860
 and they're really understandable questions

61
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,220
 that come for him.

62
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,300
 And at some point in life,

63
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,140
 if you ever had parents that encouraged you

64
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,740
 to believe in the Easter bunny,

65
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,220
 you get a little bit older and you begin to realize

66
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,120
 that those questions that you had about the bunny

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,860
 were really understandable.

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,540
 And it seems like you're confronted with the truth

69
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,060
 that, oh, there really isn't an Easter bunny.

70
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,820
 And I never got answers to those questions.

71
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,380
 And it was just some like wishful thinking

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,300
 that my parents wanted me to believe

73
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,300
 'cause that would be fun if life really actually

74
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,820
 had an Easter bunny involved in it.

75
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,300
 And the reason I start there is because I think

76
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,860
 for a lot of people, as it relates to God

77
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,420
 and Christianity and faith,

78
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,900
 interestingly enough, around the same time

79
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
 they're introduced to the Easter bunny,

80
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,660
 a lot of us were introduced to the idea of God.

81
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,380
 And just like the unanswered questions of like,

82
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
 why does he bring eggs?

83
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,340
 How big is he?

84
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,100
 And all these things chip away at my ability

85
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,260
 to believe in the Easter bunny.

86
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,760
 And eventually I'm like, I don't think this is true at all.

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,100
 A lot of our unanswered and understandable questions

88
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,060
 about God that never get great answers from people

89
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,400
 begin to chip away at our ability to believe in God.

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,340
 And just like we're like, I'm abandoning,

91
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,460
 I'm not even sure I can believe in the Easter bunny anymore.

92
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,240
 I just have too many questions that don't have good answers.

93
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,660
 That's the journey a lot of us experienced with God,

94
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,520
 where we find ourselves with really understandable questions

95
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,100
 that never get answered.

96
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,540
 And it just chips away over time at our ability

97
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,780
 to believe the God we were told about,

98
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,560
 and the Christian God is really true.

99
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,340
 And so my heart in doing this series and our heart as a team

100
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,420
 is that we would address some of those questions.

101
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,820
 'Cause there's a lot of understandable questions

102
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,780
 that people wrestle with as it relates to faith

103
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,020
 and as it relates to God,

104
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,640
 and as it relates to is Jesus really the only way?

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,180
 That means billions of people

106
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,500
 are not gonna spend eternity with him.

107
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,660
 God is love, and yet he sends people to hell.

108
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,340
 Like, how is that possible?

109
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,500
 The Bible is actually the words of God,

110
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 but it was written by men.

111
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,100
 Can we really trust that it's inspired,

112
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,980
 that it hasn't been changed?

113
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,180
 And then the topic for tonight,

114
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,820
 which is the question of how can God be good

115
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,820
 in so much bad, brokenness, evil exists around us?

116
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,220
 So that's the question I really wanna launch in tonight

117
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,340
 and this whole series is just an attempt to give answers

118
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,860
 to some of those questions

119
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,180
 that many of us have had for a long time.

120
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,660
 Maybe we don't wrestle with it in terms of doubt,

121
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,140
 but we just don't even know how to answer our friends

122
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,060
 or family members who see these as objections

123
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,940
 to why they can't put their faith in God

124
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,860
 and they can't come to believe it.

125
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,980
 So that's our heart behind this series.

126
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,520
 And tonight, I wanna jump into probably the biggest objection

127
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,140
 that people have, or the most commonly mentioned one,

128
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,860
 which is that how can God be totally good, totally powerful,

129
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,220
 and so much around our world is filled with bad,

130
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,120
 tragedy, painful, horrific things?

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,440
 I mean, not just like viruses

132
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,180
 that end up costing people jobs

133
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,420
 and losing lives and livelihoods and all of that,

134
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,100
 but well before this, I mean, you look around

135
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,580
 and you see children daily starving to death.

136
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,460
 You see, people walk into school buildings

137
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,020
 and they shoot up their classmates.

138
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,300
 God could stop all of that, right?

139
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,580
 I mean, he's God.

140
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,100
 You see people who have a child that gets cancer

141
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,580
 and they don't win the battle to cancer

142
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,280
 and they bury their five-year-old.

143
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,620
 Where's God in that?

144
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,840
 And this is a very understandable question

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,120
 and there are good answers to it.

146
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,400
 And so for the next really 30 minutes that we have,

147
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
 I wanna launch into really giving you two questions

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,640
 that I wanna talk about as it relates to this idea

149
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,240
 of God is good and bad things happen.

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
 That's the fact that I want us to check tonight.

151
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,100
 God is good and bad things happen.

152
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,880
 And in doing so, I wanna look at two questions

153
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
 and an explanation about how that can be the case.

154
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,960
 Let me preface one more time before we dive in.

155
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,440
 If you are walking through a season of life

156
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,800
 where you are in suffering, you're experiencing pain,

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,160
 you're experiencing trial,

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,060
 this is not the message that is gonna solve

159
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,340
 all of those things, but it will give you a framework

160
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,840
 through which to see some of that pain and experience.

161
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,780
 In other words, this is more addressing at a higher level

162
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,120
 how that can be possible,

163
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
 that God is good and bad things exist.

164
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,940
 But for me to attempt to say this message

165
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,120
 is gonna do away with any pain that you're experiencing

166
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
 or anything that you're feeling

167
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,400
 and all that you're walking through would be crazy.

168
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,180
 And at the same time, I do wanna give us some truth

169
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,920
 that we can look at that gives us some framework

170
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,360
 for understanding how that can be a true statement.

171
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,320
 So I'm gonna give you two questions, one explanation.

172
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,800
 The first question is this,

173
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,320
 just a high level thing we're gonna visit about.

174
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
 Do bad things, and by that I mean bad,

175
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 I mean evil, I mean pain,

176
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,340
 I mean anything you need to put in that bucket.

177
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,240
 Do bad things prove that God isn't real?

178
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,420
 You may have family members, you sit down,

179
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,520
 Larry King has said on live television

180
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,660
 to millions of people, like,

181
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,860
 "Hey, here's why I can't believe in God.

182
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,380
 "I just look at the world, there's so much chaos,

183
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,220
 "there's so much hurt,

184
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,260
 "there's so much brokenness all around us.

185
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,980
 "The fact that a God is even out there

186
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,240
 "is hard for me to believe

187
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,600
 "'cause he's certainly not in control if that's going on.

188
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,900
 "So I'm not even sure God is real."

189
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,140
 So do bad things prove that God isn't real?

190
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,740
 Here's why I would say no.

191
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,280
 First, let's talk a little bit about even bad things,

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,680
 that idea of us classifying, like,

193
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,560
 "Oh, those are really messed up,

194
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 "that's wrong, that's an injustice, that's bad."

195
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,280
 Anything that we put inside of that bucket,

196
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,680
 'cause I think for most of us,

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,600
 there's probably things that all of us here,

198
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
 those who are listening at home,

199
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,600
 I think we'd probably put some things in that bucket

200
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,560
 if we could, that we'd at least all agree on.

201
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
 Some of those things that I wrote down would be,

202
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,120
 "Hey, murder, I think the vast majority of people

203
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,280
 "would put murder in that bucket."

204
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,800
 My point is, we may disagree on speeding,

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
 and some people may be like, "That's such an injustice,"

206
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,580
 and other people would be like, "Ah, you know,

207
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,740
 "I was in a hurry," or, "I didn't see it, you know,

208
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,800
 "and I'm looking the other way,

209
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,820
 "so I don't feel bad about speeding."

210
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,920
 But most of us would put certain things like murder,

211
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,500
 we'd put sexual abuse or rape,

212
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,460
 terrorism, adultery, slavery, racism.

213
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,020
 Like, I think most of us would put, am I wrong?

214
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,800
 Am I wrong or am I not wrong, okay?

215
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,140
 Most of us would put in that bucket,

216
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
 "Hey, these things are there."

217
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,900
 And here, I wanna ask a crazy question

218
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,060
 that's gonna be so bizarre if you're tuning in.

219
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,500
 Why?

220
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,580
 Like, why would you put that in that bucket?

221
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,780
 Like, why are they wrong?

222
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,800
 And if somebody said, "Hey, look, that's wrong for you.

223
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,900
 "You know, I think murder is okay for me,

224
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,740
 "or adultery is okay for me, or hey, slavery is okay for me,

225
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,740
 "that's just kinda your opinion."

226
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,140
 I think most of us would go, "No, it's wrong, period."

227
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,980
 But why?

228
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,240
 Why do you have the sense that there are things

229
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,340
 that are right and things that are wrong?

230
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,980
 Like, injustice is a reality.

231
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,100
 If you've ever wrestled with the fact that,

232
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,420
 "Man, I just, I can't believe in God

233
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,440
 "because there's so much messed up in this world.

234
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,020
 "I just can't get over that.

235
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,720
 "I don't even know that God's there."

236
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,820
 I just wanna ask you the question

237
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,700
 before we even launch to that second part.

238
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,900
 What makes you think, or why are you so certain

239
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,900
 there's such a thing as right and wrong, as bad and good?

240
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,260
 Because the Christian explanation would be

241
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,860
 that that's not an argument against God.

242
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,840
 That, if anything, is an argument and evidence for God.

243
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,600
 In other words, the Christian explanation is

244
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,880
 the reason why most of us would universally agree,

245
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,420
 "Hey, those are wrong, period."

246
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,040
 There are things that are just straight up evil every time,

247
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,480
 no matter who thinks that they're not.

248
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,540
 Because we believe that God has given us

249
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,680
 kind of a moral standard, a moral law,

250
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,780
 that he has put into the human heart.

251
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,640
 And that is the reason why, no matter what you believe,

252
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,800
 people will find themselves thinking,

253
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,280
 "I just think that child abuse, or beating a child,

254
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,120
 "is wrong.

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,200
 "I think that walking in and strapping an explosive vest

256
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
 "to yourself and walking into a school

257
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,880
 "and blowing up people is wrong."

258
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,960
 The Christian perspective would be

259
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,500
 the reason why you know that it's wrong

260
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,120
 in your heart of hearts is because God put it there.

261
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,360
 A moral standard was placed by a moral law giver

262
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,320
 who gave that moral law,

263
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 and God put that and imprinted it on your heart.

264
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,440
 Romans chapter two, verses 14 and 15 says, Paul speaking,

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,400
 "Hey, when Gentiles,"

266
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,680
 that's people who don't know anything about God,

267
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,440
 who don't have the law, talking about the Bible,

268
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,520
 "by nature do what the law requires.

269
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,900
 "They are a law unto themselves,

270
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,740
 "even though they don't have the law."

271
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,620
 Like in other words, when they live

272
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,080
 and they operate in society and they're kind to people,

273
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,680
 and they pay their taxes, and they don't kill people,

274
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
 and they don't commit adultery,

275
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,000
 they're showing that there's something written on their heart

276
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,680
 that goes, "Oh man, that's not okay.

277
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,080
 "I don't think I'm supposed to do that."

278
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,140
 He says, "That's because God put that law on their heart."

279
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,260
 They show the requirements of the law

280
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,100
 are written on their hearts,

281
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,140
 and their conscience also bears witness,

282
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,680
 and their thoughts sometimes accusing them,

283
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,900
 or even at other times defending them.

284
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,440
 Paul says, "Hey, the reason why people have that,"

285
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,360
 and there's a sense of like,

286
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,320
 "Man, that's not okay," to certain things,

287
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,040
 is because God put that standard onto their heart.

288
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,240
 And let me ask you a question.

289
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,820
 Without God, who is responsible

290
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,680
 for deciding what's wrong and what's not?

291
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,800
 In other words, it becomes very difficult

292
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,540
 to even say there is such a thing as,

293
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,560
 "Hey, that's wrong," or, "That is bad,

294
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,260
 "and so I don't believe in you, God."

295
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,040
 It's hard to even say, "Hey, that's bad,"

296
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,700
 if there is no God,

297
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,840
 because anything that you deem as, "Man, that's wrong,"

298
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,280
 is just your opinion.

299
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000
 It may be the opinion of millions of people around you,

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
 or even society.

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
 It may even be an opinion that evolution developed over time,

302
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,560
 but without God, there is no objective standard

303
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,160
 like that's actually wrong, and this is actually right.

304
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,560
 This is why I say,

305
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,200
 does bad things happening in our world disprove God?

306
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,040
 No, if anything, it is a more evidence,

307
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,840
 or it is greater evidence for the fact that there is a God,

308
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,100
 and he puts something inside of you

309
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,240
 that when bad happens, you go, "This is not right.

310
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,920
 "It's not supposed to be like this."

311
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,240
 C.S. Lewis, who is just a brilliant thinker,

312
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,960
 maybe one of the most intelligent thinkers and writers

313
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,660
 in all of Christian history, he talked about it.

314
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
 He was an atheist.

315
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,240
 He was an Oxford professor,

316
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,680
 and for most of his life, he was an atheist,

317
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,800
 and he writes about how,

318
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,220
 "This gnawing fact that I had something inside of me

319
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,560
 "that although I saw all the bad in the world,

320
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,280
 "I began to go, 'Man, there's so much messed up,'

321
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,700
 "and the fact that I recognize it's messed up

322
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,820
 "is not a problem for my belief in God,

323
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,300
 "but a problem for me to not believe in God."

324
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,340
 He says this in "Mere Christianity," just a well-known book.

325
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,620
 "My argument against God,"

326
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,420
 he's speaking when he was an atheist,

327
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,540
 "was that the universe, the world,

328
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,540
 "was so cruel and unjust.

329
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,880
 "Where did I get this idea of just and unjust?

330
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,920
 "What was I comparing this world to

331
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,580
 "when I said it was unjust?

332
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,940
 "Of course, if I had given up my idea of justice

333
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,380
 "by saying it was nothing but my opinion

334
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,380
 "that that's unjust, not a universal law,

335
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:39,400
 "but if I did that, my argument against God collapsed too,

336
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,620
 "for the argument depended on me saying

337
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,500
 "the world was really unjust or messed up."

338
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,120
 And he says, "Consequently, consequently,

339
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,580
 "atheism turns out to be too simple.

340
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,200
 "It was a greater problem for his atheism

341
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
 "than for his belief in God,

342
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,900
 "and it's ultimately what led him

343
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,960
 "to become a believer in God."

344
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,800
 You guys may not know this,

345
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,660
 I'm gonna give a little history lesson

346
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,660
 on something that further illustrates

347
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,980
 that as a society, we know this is true,

348
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,420
 and we've pointed to it at different historical moments.

349
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,780
 You guys know what the Nuremberg trials are?

350
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,580
 No, okay, all right, history lesson,

351
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,740
 everybody thinking cap on, here's what we got.

352
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,180
 There's something called World War II,

353
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,820
 happened after World War I.

354
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,180
 There's a nation in Europe, went a little cray,

355
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,460
 a lot crazy, and they tried to take over the world

356
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,060
 and did horrific, horrific things.

357
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,380
 You guys familiar, following me?

358
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,680
 Called the Nazis.

359
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,300
 And the Nazis did a number of different things,

360
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
 took over countries, they tried to exterminate

361
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,460
 an entire group of people, I mean, horrific,

362
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,580
 some of the greatest atrocities in history

363
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,220
 took place under that regime.

364
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,760
 The war went over, it was won, the Allies conquered,

365
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,260
 and they went and they put the chief leaders

366
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,540
 of the Nazis on trial.

367
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,380
 Do you guys know this?

368
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,460
 Dude, this is crazy.

369
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,420
 And so they put the Nuremberg,

370
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,460
 or at the Nuremberg trials, they put all the head guys,

371
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,100
 like not the little guy who's like, you know,

372
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,780
 they're being told to shove people,

373
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,420
 like, hey, you guys are the master planners of all of this.

374
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,700
 And they began to put them on trial.

375
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,260
 And the defense of the Nazis was,

376
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,300
 there's no international law.

377
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,700
 We only did what was legal in any area that we conquered.

378
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,160
 You can't say that anything that we did was wrong legally,

379
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,340
 because at that time, there wasn't any international law

380
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
 that they could have done to.

381
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,580
 It's a pretty brilliant defense,

382
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,060
 or it's a defense that you would say, like, you know,

383
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,220
 I guess there's some point in that.

384
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
 And they argued that, hey, we're not accountable here

385
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,580
 because we didn't break any laws.

386
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,620
 So you can't hold us accountable to anything.

387
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,160
 And the prosecution, which was the world,

388
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,860
 said in the opening statements and all throughout it,

389
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,480
 you have violated the law of God and nature,

390
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,440
 and you are held to a higher authority.

391
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,500
 There is a higher law to which all mankind is subject,

392
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,200
 and on that, we condemn you.

393
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,480
 And many of them lost their lives, they were put in prison.

394
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,760
 But my point is, even as world, the global presence was like,

395
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,480
 hey, no, there isn't an international law that says

396
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,960
 you cannot take over someone's property

397
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,980
 and try to exterminate a race.

398
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,300
 You're right, Nazis.

399
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,280
 But there's a higher law, a higher law of God,

400
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,080
 and you have violated that, and by that, they condemn them.

401
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,840
 My point is this, the idea that bad things happen

402
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,240
 does not point against the evidence of God.

403
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,680
 If anything, it points towards him.

404
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,440
 The second question I wanna ask is much more

405
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,260
 at the center of tonight's message,

406
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,440
 and that is, but does bad things happening

407
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,600
 prove God isn't good?

408
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 Like, how do you not stop terrorist acts,

409
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,680
 school shootings, viruses from exploding all over?

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,160
 Like, God, what are you doing?

411
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,220
 It's really hard to hold onto the fact

412
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,200
 that this world is so messed up,

413
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,980
 so many people lose their life.

414
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,240
 Throughout all of history,

415
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,580
 such horrific things have happened, and you're totally good?

416
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,880
 And you could stop anything and everything that you want

417
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
 in a moment, and you don't?

418
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
 Doesn't the fact that so much bad happens

419
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,760
 prove that God is not good?

420
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,920
 And I wanna attempt as best I can

421
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,880
 to show you the answer is no, it doesn't prove that.

422
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
 And stay with me.

423
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,800
 Again, this is more almost a thinking cap kind of thing.

424
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,360
 If the question is like, hey, God, if you're really good,

425
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,240
 you would, in a moment, you'd get rid of all the evil

426
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,920
 out there that there is.

427
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,560
 Like, how have you not gotten rid of all the bad

428
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,320
 and messed up stuff in our world yet?

429
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,360
 And it's a question that many times people ask,

430
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,080
 and if you've ever had a conversation with people

431
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,320
 who doubt or have objections, they'll bring this up.

432
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,920
 And so let me enter into a hypothetical.

433
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,840
 Let's say I'm in the conversation with Emma,

434
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,920
 we're talking right here, and she brought that up to me.

435
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,320
 And I was to ask Emma, okay, great, you're wondering,

436
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,800
 hey, why is God, because in a moment,

437
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,180
 he could get rid of all the bad things in our world,

438
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,720
 why has he not done that yet?

439
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,960
 Why is he okay with that, and how can he be good?

440
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,200
 Well, let me ask her.

441
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
 If she could, in a moment, get rid of all the bad

442
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,040
 that was out there by hitting a button,

443
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,480
 here's how that was easy button,

444
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,920
 and in a moment, you could hit a button

445
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,320
 and all the evil on the entire planet was gone, would you?

446
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,800
 And I don't know what the answer she would say is,

447
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,960
 or she just said, sure.

448
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
 Here's why I would think that is a bad idea.

449
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,860
 And a lot of us may think, yeah, of course I would,

450
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,560
 in a moment, but before you hit that button,

451
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,720
 you've got to think about it honestly.

452
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,800
 When you say get rid of all the bad out there,

453
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,680
 what about you?

454
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,280
 Have you ever done anything bad?

455
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,900
 What about everyone that you know and love,

456
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,600
 like your mom, your parents,

457
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,120
 even before you ever came along,

458
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,000
 you think they've ever done anything bad in life?

459
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,540
 You hit that button, you're not just getting rid

460
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,360
 of all the bad out there,

461
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,160
 you're getting rid of the bad in you.

462
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,700
 And so when you think through that lens,

463
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,880
 you may go, oh, man, I don't know if I would hit that button

464
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,440
 'cause God, in a moment, could.

465
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
 And just like after hearing that, my guess is,

466
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,020
 Emma wouldn't go, yeah, I'd for sure wanna get rid of me

467
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,520
 and everyone I love and everything that I care about

468
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,600
 in this life with a moment,

469
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,660
 because all those have aspects of bad inside of them.

470
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,440
 And she has reason because she loves

471
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,360
 and cares about those people.

472
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,560
 In the same way, the biblical understanding

473
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,480
 is that God also has a reason

474
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,400
 why today he has not hit the button

475
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,120
 because he could instantly,

476
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,520
 and that reason is you and me

477
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,560
 and people coming into a relationship with him.

478
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,280
 He allows, in other words, he's a God who is good,

479
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,360
 and he allows things that are not good or bad to happen

480
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,000
 because in his sovereign control,

481
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,720
 he brings about, or there's a good

482
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,820
 that he wants to bring about.

483
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,000
 There's a good reason why he allows bad things

484
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
 to happen today.

485
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
 And ultimately, Peter says, and the Bible teaches,

486
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,000
 that good reason is you and me

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
 and people coming into a relationship with him.

488
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,080
 One day he will get rid of all of it,

489
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
 and he will hit that button,

490
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
 but today he is patient,

491
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,200
 hoping more people to escape,

492
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,560
 not just the bad things in our world,

493
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,440
 but a bad eternity apart from him in hell.

494
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,120
 Peter, who spent as much time with Jesus

495
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,160
 as anyone that we know of,

496
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,560
 one of Jesus' closest friends,

497
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,800
 wrote this in 2 Peter 3,

498
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,860
 some of his last words that he ever wrote.

499
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,280
 "Above all, you must understand that in the last days,

500
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,960
 scoffers will come."

501
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,840
 Scoffers is like mockers or people who are like,

502
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,400
 "Dude, I can't believe you still believe in God.

503
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,040
 It's so outdated."

504
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,240
 He says, "Those people are gonna come,

505
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,380
 and they'll scoff or mock,

506
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,940
 and they'll follow their own evil desires,

507
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,780
 and they will say,

508
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,840
 'Where is the coming of Jesus that he promised?

509
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,920
 Since the beginning, or ever since our ancestors died,

510
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
 everything goes on as it always has

511
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
 since the beginning of creation.

512
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,600
 You guys are waiting for a Jesus that's not coming back,

513
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,260
 and they'll mock,'" he says.

514
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,740
 But do not forget this one thing, verse eight.

515
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,020
 "With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years,

516
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,340
 and a thousand years like a day.

517
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,480
 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,

518
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,420
 as some understand slowness.

519
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,220
 Instead, he is patient with you,

520
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,620
 with everyone, not wanting anyone to perish,

521
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,100
 but everyone to come to repentance

522
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,580
 or into a relationship with him."

523
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,540
 The Bible teaches that all the bad and brokenness

524
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,100
 in our world breaks God's heart way more

525
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,780
 than it ever has broken yours.

526
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,620
 He sees everything wrong that has ever taken place.

527
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,160
 In other words, there's no like messed up action,

528
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,340
 or sin, or murder, or death, or abuse.

529
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,080
 God sees all of it, and it breaks his heart way more

530
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,460
 than it breaks any of our hearts.

531
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,780
 But it teaches that he is patient,

532
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,420
 and he allows it today, this temporary bad things to exist,

533
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,620
 so that as many people as possible

534
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,480
 would escape eternal bad things,

535
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,100
 or an eternal bad reality.

536
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,740
 It's apart from God.

537
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:37,420
 I think the challenge, or another way of saying it would be,

538
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,740
 if God was to remove everything bad about this world,

539
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,460
 he would have to remove me, and he'd have to remove you.

540
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,860
 And Christians believe God, in the form of Jesus,

541
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,980
 came into the world, not to remove you, but to forgive you.

542
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,340
 And that's why God is waiting,

543
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,080
 because he wants as many people as possible

544
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,000
 to experience his forgiveness in this life.

545
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,980
 And you can trust that he's a good God,

546
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,200
 that even though bad things happen,

547
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,480
 has promised, "I only allow them to happen,

548
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,780
 "and I bring about good through those things.

549
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,740
 "And there's a good reason why I allow,

550
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,240
 "or continue to allow anything bad that has happened."

551
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
 The Bible doesn't promise that you will have

552
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,940
 a life free of pain, it promises there will be purpose

553
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,120
 connected to the pain for those who know God.

554
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,920
 And here's where I get stuck, and where I get caught up.

555
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,500
 I assume that anything that is painful in my life,

556
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,160
 or anything that's challenging, that I can see,

557
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,820
 I'll be able to see and connect the dots to like,

558
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,000
 "Oh, this is what he was teaching me in that moment,"

559
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,440
 or, "This is what God was up to then,

560
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,860
 "and man, he's the best."

561
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,040
 I assume that anytime I walk through a challenging time,

562
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,740
 I'll be able to connect the dots, and I'll see like,

563
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,520
 "Oh, this is why that happened."

564
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,180
 And a lot of times, we just can't see it.

565
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,420
 It doesn't mean that it's not there,

566
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,140
 I just, I'm not smart enough, or I'm not able enough,

567
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,360
 wise enough to connect the dots of like,

568
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,980
 "Oh, this is what God was doing all along,

569
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,700
 "in his plan, and in his will,

570
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,660
 "and how he was working things together."

571
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,000
 It's like this, I think a lot of times we assume

572
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,100
 that if it was there, we'd see it.

573
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,320
 And the good news right now about our world

574
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,700
 is all of us are experiencing a reality

575
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,900
 where we're confronted with the fact that there are times

576
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,280
 where something is there, even though we can't see it.

577
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,500
 And so for me to assume that, "Hey, I can't see anything

578
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,060
 "there, so it must not be there," is just wrong.

579
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,900
 What do I mean by that?

580
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,500
 Like, you guys have Amazon Prime?

581
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,760
 Yeah?

582
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,980
 Used it?

583
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,820
 Yeah, it's amazing.

584
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,340
 A little slower lately, but it's all good.

585
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,220
 Amazon Prime, so if you got a package today

586
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,300
 on your front desk, or front desk,

587
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,680
 on your front porch cowl, and it came there,

588
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,420
 and it was dropped off, and there was a package there,

589
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,380
 and I said, "Hey," I called you, and it's like,

590
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,640
 "Hey, dude, I just want you to know,

591
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,260
 "there's an elephant on top of the package

592
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,780
 "outside of your door."

593
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,100
 You'd be like, "What?

594
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,360
 "No, bro, I'm telling you, there's an elephant,

595
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,640
 "you gotta go look.

596
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,100
 "There's an elephant on the package."

597
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,580
 This is going somewhere, 'cause it's so weird.

598
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,180
 Like a real elephant, like a lion,

599
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,940
 like it's like seven feet tall, it's huge,

600
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,700
 it's on the package outside of your front door.

601
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,940
 You would very easily be able to go to the front door,

602
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,700
 open, and see elephant or no elephant.

603
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,060
 It wouldn't be like, you'd be like,

604
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,200
 "Hey, I went and looked, and you think, like,

605
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,540
 "it went under the package, or I just can't see it

606
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,020
 "right now," you would know very clearly,

607
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,660
 like, "Hey, it's there, or it's not there."

608
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,820
 Now, if I called you, and I said,

609
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,000
 "Hey, there's coronavirus on the package

610
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
 "that's outside of your front door."

611
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,080
 If you called me back, and you were like,

612
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,100
 "Hey, I went to the door, and I looked for it,

613
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,040
 "and I looked, and I was like,

614
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,860
 "is there any corona on top of this?

615
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,980
 "No, I think we're good," and you walked in,

616
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,420
 it would not be great to conclude

617
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,080
 that you were absolutely right.

618
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,460
 There still could have been corona there,

619
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,140
 whether or not you could have seen it.

620
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,460
 In the same way, we often assume that,

621
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,700
 "Hey, if there's a purpose, it's gonna be like an elephant,

622
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,680
 "I could see it," versus like a virus

623
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,980
 that I can't always see that it's there.

624
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,940
 And the Bible says that God is so far above any human mind,

625
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,060
 and any human wisdom, that we can't always know

626
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,760
 what he's doing, how he's at work, we can't always see it.

627
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,880
 But that doesn't mean it's not present in your life,

628
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,240
 just like the virus is not present on that package,

629
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,660
 to use that illustration.

630
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,080
 Isaiah chapter 55 says, "As heaven is higher than earth,

631
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,440
 "so my ways," God speaking, "are higher than your ways,

632
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,600
 "and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts."

633
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,760
 I just want you to ask or wrestle with the question,

634
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,680
 like, man, why has God not removed all evil and bad today?

635
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,800
 'Cause he's going to eventually, and he's promised that.

636
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,160
 But if you're wondering, like,

637
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,640
 "I just don't know that God can be good and evil still,

638
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,040
 "or bad things still be so everywhere around me."

639
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,200
 If you could, and you would remove everything bad,

640
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
 where would you start?

641
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,600
 Like, answer that question.

642
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,960
 If somebody you know is wrestling with,

643
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,720
 man, how is things so bad, and God claims to be good,

644
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
 I don't know that that can be true.

645
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,280
 Okay, great.

646
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,120
 If you could remove stuff bad, where would you start?

647
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,400
 Like, would you start with the five-year-old

648
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,460
 who lied one time to his parents?

649
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,560
 Like, is he gone?

650
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
 Or are we just talking about, like, rapists and murderers?

651
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,640
 They're all gone.

652
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,480
 What about the college student who cheated on their exam?

653
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,400
 This past semester?

654
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,720
 What about the person who had sex before marriage,

655
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
 or who looked at pornography, or who,

656
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
 where would you start and draw the line?

657
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,640
 The truth is, the only way for God

658
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,680
 to get rid of all the bad things in the world

659
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,600
 would be to get rid of all of us,

660
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,040
 and he didn't come to remove us, he came to forgive us,

661
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,180
 and that's what Christians believe.

662
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:36,120
 Finally, I just wanna provide an explanation

663
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,200
 to how Christians have always understood,

664
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,240
 and how Christians think about

665
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,240
 how God is good, and yet bad things happen today.

666
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,460
 And it happened the way that we understand it,

667
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,120
 traces through the origin of even evil in our world.

668
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,940
 The Christian teaching and understanding of the Bible

669
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,760
 is that God created the world that we're in right now,

670
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,600
 and it was perfect.

671
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,540
 There was nothing messed up, there was no death,

672
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,880
 there was no disease, nobody ever had a funeral,

673
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,360
 you never stood next to a loved one who was sick and dying,

674
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,420
 you never experienced pain, you never experienced grief,

675
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,880
 you never experienced any of the effects of sin

676
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,400
 that have entered into our world, it was perfect.

677
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,440
 And he put Adam and Eve in that garden,

678
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,840
 or the Garden of Eden is where they were originally placed,

679
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,800
 and to them he gave something called free will,

680
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
 he gave the ability to choose.

681
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,920
 In other words, God didn't want robots,

682
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,080
 he hasn't created robots,

683
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
 he wanted them to have the ability

684
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 to choose to have a relationship with him,

685
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,840
 to choose to love him,

686
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,500
 and to choose to walk in a relationship,

687
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,960
 and so he gave them free will.

688
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,220
 And with that free will,

689
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,100
 the human race decided to reject God,

690
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,260
 and not follow him, and not listen to him,

691
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,140
 and not do what he said, and in rejecting God,

692
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,220
 they pushed God away, and into that vacancy,

693
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,540
 or in that space where they pushed him, sin entered,

694
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,440
 and everything broke.

695
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,860
 Everything in the natural world broke,

696
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,980
 death entered into the world,

697
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,780
 and everything became fractured.

698
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,040
 You may have wondered, like, man, who invented evil?

699
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,520
 It wasn't invented, it was in this moment

700
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,880
 where they pushed God away, and in that space,

701
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,760
 all of a sudden, evil came in,

702
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,880
 because of the absence,

703
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,200
 or the lack of presence directly with God.

704
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,160
 In other words, evil is not something that was invented,

705
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,120
 just like darkness is the absence of light,

706
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,920
 evil is the absence of good, or God.

707
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,880
 As you see, as things get darker,

708
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
 it's not because, and this is intentional,

709
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,500
 they're not just shutting it down over here,

710
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,100
 like, hey, guys, it's time to go.

711
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,880
 Darkness is the absence of light.

712
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,000
 It's not just something that is invented and created there.

713
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,160
 And so that was the story, when they pushed him away,

714
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,080
 all of a sudden, sin and evil was introduced

715
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,400
 into the world, and God's response,

716
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,140
 how did God respond to a rebel human race

717
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,180
 that ran from him?

718
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,560
 Did he decide, in a moment, I'm just going to crush them,

719
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,720
 and do away with this?

720
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,560
 No.

721
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,860
 He began a mission that ultimately would send his son

722
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,440
 to die on a cross and be crushed for us.

723
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,400
 Rather than crush Adam and Eve and humanity,

724
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,520
 he sent his son to be crushed on our behalf.

725
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,220
 And now anyone who puts their faith,

726
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,320
 or accepts the free gift that God gave on the cross

727
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,640
 through Jesus, that I'm not a good enough person

728
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,260
 to experience eternal life with God,

729
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,280
 you are so good that you came into the world

730
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,900
 to be a solution for the bad, broken things around me.

731
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,280
 And you provided that solution by giving your life for me.

732
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,020
 And you experienced eternal death for me.

733
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,520
 And I know I can have a relationship with you,

734
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,640
 not because of how good I am, or how bad I'm not,

735
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,400
 but because of how good you are, so good you gave your life,

736
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,760
 and you paid for me to have a way to have eternity

737
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,800
 and eternal life with you.

738
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,280
 And one day, the Bible teaches,

739
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,960
 he's going to make everything around us new.

740
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,580
 There will be no more war, there will be no more disease,

741
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,520
 there will be no more death, and he will make a new heavens

742
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,800
 and a new earth, and everything remade.

743
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,160
 And everyone who trusts in him

744
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,400
 will be a part of that new world.

745
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,560
 And that is what Christians have believed.

746
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,920
 We believe that we're in a world right now

747
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,760
 that's not our home,

748
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,120
 that's why there's brokenness all around us.

749
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,960
 It's never been a contradiction for Christians

750
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
 to see bad things around us and say,

751
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,880
 "Oh man, now I'm not sure that the Bible's teachings apply."

752
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,320
 No, Christianity is not in contradiction

753
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,680
 to the fact that there's bad things.

754
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,060
 It is the solution to the fact that there's bad things

755
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,200
 all around us in this world.

756
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,600
 I mean, listen, we worship a God who is perfect,

757
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,240
 who is so good, and yet the worst thing possible

758
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,600
 happened to him.

759
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,120
 He was crucified and experienced eternal death.

760
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,340
 Think about that.

761
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,240
 The idea that good things or bad things

762
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
 could happen to good people

763
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,580
 is not in contradiction to Christianity.

764
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,480
 Christianity is a solution for that reality

765
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,800
 because the worst thing happened to the best person,

766
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,100
 who is Jesus.

767
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,240
 It's never been a contradiction.

768
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,800
 And Jesus, when he was here, he promised,

769
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,240
 "Hey, don't buy the lie that a lot of people

770
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,140
 "are gonna tell you maybe,

771
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,460
 "that hey, if you just are a good person,

772
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,040
 "good things happen to good people.

773
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,320
 "Bad things never happen to good people."

774
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,960
 He never promised that.

775
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,960
 He promised you were gonna have trouble in this life.

776
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,260
 It was promised.

777
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,760
 In John chapter 16, he's having a conversation

778
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,260
 with some of his guys, and here's what he says.

779
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,520
 "I've told you these things," Jesus speaking,

780
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,360
 "so that in me you may have peace.

781
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,540
 "In this world, you will have trouble.

782
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,740
 "But take heart, I will overcome the world."

783
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,580
 All right, I have overcome the world.

784
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,260
 "You're gonna have trouble in this world.

785
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,380
 "It's not your ultimate home,

786
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,820
 "and Christians have always accepted that."

787
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,080
 And here's where it gets really ironic and interesting.

788
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,320
 Jesus just promised, "Hey, I just want everyone to know,

789
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,800
 "in this life, you're gonna have a lot of trouble.

790
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,640
 "It's gonna be hard.

791
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,840
 "There's gonna be things that come your way,

792
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,220
 "but guarantee it, take it to the bank.

793
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,660
 "There's gonna be trouble."

794
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,620
 And ironically, Christians, when we hit trouble,

795
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,420
 we're like, "See, this is why I can't trust you, huh?"

796
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,520
 It would be like this.

797
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
 If you and I were going deep sea fishing,

798
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,760
 and we went on the boat, we're gonna go fishing out there,

799
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,940
 and I don't know why we'd be doing that,

800
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,240
 but let's say we were, and we're going fishing,

801
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,520
 and before we get on the boat, I'm like,

802
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,080
 "Hey, Colby, I'm just telling you, bro,

803
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,140
 "you're about to get on this boat,

804
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,640
 "and it's gonna make you nauseous and really seasick,

805
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,280
 "and it's just gonna happen.

806
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,840
 "I'm promising you it's gonna happen.

807
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,860
 "And so let me just tell you,

808
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,320
 "here's the best way to endure

809
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,420
 "and handle and face the seasickness, 'cause it's happening."

810
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,600
 And you're like, "Oh, man, I don't know.

811
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,440
 "Maybe it won't happen."

812
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,520
 I'm like, "No, it's happening.

813
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,200
 "I guarantee it's gonna happen."

814
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,720
 And then we get on the boat, and all of a sudden,

815
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,080
 like I said, you become incredibly seasick,

816
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,320
 and you were to then go,

817
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,960
 "See, this is why I can't trust you.

818
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,560
 "After I just told you, you are going to get seasick.

819
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,500
 "If you get on that boat, it's gonna happen,

820
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,600
 "and let me just help you endure it."

821
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,860
 You would be nuts to go, "Hey, man, you told me that,

822
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,000
 "and this is why I can't trust you."

823
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And ironically, that's what we do in our faith so oftentimes.

824
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,640
 It's not that it's un-understandable

825
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,800
 or not understandable that it happens.

826
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,680
 It's just not in line with what the Bible teaches.

827
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,600
 Jesus promised, "This is not our home,

828
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,300
 "and you will experience pain."

829
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,960
 Isaiah chapter 43 says, "When you walk through the fire,"

830
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,040
 not if you walk through the fire.

831
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,120
 But he hasn't promised that life is gonna be easy,

832
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,240
 and some of you, candidly,

833
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,720
 you have bought a perception of God

834
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,900
 that the Bible doesn't teach,

835
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,920
 that tonight, maybe the best thing you can do

836
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,920
 is say, "Man, I wanna repent and believe in the one true God."

837
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,480
 Like the version of God you bought

838
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,280
 is that God is like a secret service agent

839
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,720
 who's constantly protecting you,

840
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,360
 and he's constantly gonna make sure this doesn't happen.

841
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,040
 And that's not what the Bible teaches.

842
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,020
 It doesn't teach that, man, if you just follow God,

843
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,640
 everything will be easy all the time.

844
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,400
 And the best thing you could do is say,

845
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,860
 "Man, I'm gonna surrender the wrong,

846
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,260
 "the version of God that I bought

847
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,320
 "that he's like a secret service God

848
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,200
 "is just as not true as the Easter bunny is."

849
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,280
 But there is a God who is there

850
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,240
 who's promised to be the solution

851
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,760
 for all the pain and all the brokenness

852
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,100
 and all the bad things in this world.

853
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,480
 And he went to a cross, and he died for you and for me

854
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,920
 in order to be that solution.

855
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,840
 And one day, he is coming, and he will make everything new.

856
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,140
 In Revelation chapter 21,

857
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,440
 some of the last words in the Bible,

858
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,400
 it's the last two chapters,

859
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,120
 I want you to see what one of the very first actions

860
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,420
 that God does when everything is made new.

861
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,300
 Revelation chapter 21, verse one.

862
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,180
 John, who wrote this book,

863
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,580
 is one of Jesus's close friends, like Peter,

864
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,260
 begins to talk about the future that's coming for Christians

865
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,620
 and this new world that we're headed towards.

866
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,540
 And he says this, "Then I saw,"

867
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,260
 speaking of this vision that God gave him,

868
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,140
 "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,

869
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,500
 "for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,"

870
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,720
 that's this one, "and there was no longer any sea.

871
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,140
 "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,

872
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,580
 "Look," this throne that's there,

873
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,420
 and all of a sudden,

874
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,860
 someone on this incredible king's throne begins to speak.

875
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,620
 "Look, God's dwelling place is now among the people,

876
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,300
 "and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people,

877
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,100
 "and God himself will be their God,

878
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,020
 "and he will wipe away every tear from their eyes.

879
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,280
 "There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain

880
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,080
 "for the older order of things has passed away.

881
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,540
 "He who is seated on the throne said,

882
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,160
 "I am making everything new."

883
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,960
 One of the very first actions that we're told in the Bible,

884
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,260
 we're told that God is gonna do

885
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,700
 in the new earth and new heavens,

886
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,740
 is he's gonna reach out

887
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,940
 and he's gonna wipe away every tear from every eye.

888
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,460
 Think about the intimacy of that action.

889
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,580
 Like that's a very intimate action, if you think about it.

890
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,980
 Like if, in other words,

891
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,380
 if Anthony was over here crying and I was like,

892
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,100
 "Hey, just got something right there,"

893
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,940
 it would be a total invasion,

894
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,860
 especially in quarantine of social distancing,

895
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,920
 but also an invasion regardless of the time

896
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,780
 of personal space.

897
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,500
 Like I don't even honestly do that with my wife

898
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,780
 when she's crying, I'm not like,

899
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,700
 "Let me get that mascara right there."

900
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,820
 It's just a weird thing.

901
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,400
 You know what the only person that I do that with?

902
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,240
 My kids.

903
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,300
 Like it's incredibly intimate.

904
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,240
 Like whenever they're crying,

905
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,220
 my daughter's crying about something,

906
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,060
 my son's crying about something,

907
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,980
 I put them on my knee, I kiss their head,

908
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,860
 and I wipe away their tears.

909
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,300
 It's incredibly intimate.

910
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,180
 This is the picture that God paints

911
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,700
 of his relationship with every believer.

912
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,400
 And there's gonna come a day in the midst of all the pain

913
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,460
 that all of you are walking through

914
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,220
 and will face for the rest of your life

915
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,860
 where he's gonna go.

916
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,800
 And so he puts you on his knee

917
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,100
 and he wipes away every tear from your eye

918
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,780
 like a father or a mother would to their child.

919
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,540
 That's how intimate God's first action

920
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,620
 towards his people is.

921
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,660
 And welcomes into a world where death never exists anymore.

922
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,640
 Here's the challenge of this message.

923
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,220
 It is not emotionally satisfying.

924
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,120
 Like in other words, the idea that,

925
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,760
 oh man, well I guess bad things happen

926
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,680
 that doesn't disprove God.

927
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,360
 And you know, I guess if I was God,

928
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,040
 I don't know that I would hit the button to remove evil

929
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,080
 and he's going to eventually.

930
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,300
 And Christianity, I guess it makes sense

931
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,940
 that God is the solution for all the bad things,

932
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,020
 but it just doesn't sit right to me

933
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,100
 that so much evil is taking place around the world.

934
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,140
 That so many girls are sold into sex slavery.

935
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,300
 Like how do you reconcile that?

936
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,700
 That people are abused domestically by their spouse.

937
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,960
 That sickness happens.

938
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,440
 Cancer seems random.

939
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,660
 Like none of that sits okay.

940
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,740
 Like there's no answer that makes me emotionally satisfied.

941
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,160
 And here's the truth, and I need you to hear this

942
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,780
 'cause some of you have never heard this before.

943
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,980
 There is no emotional satisfier,

944
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,520
 emotionally satisfying answer to the problem of pain

945
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,720
 and evil and brokenness in our world.

946
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,840
 It doesn't exist.

947
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,240
 And here's why, and this is really important

948
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,700
 in case you tuned out.

949
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,960
 Because you were made, regardless of what you believe,

950
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,240
 regardless of your religion,

951
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,580
 regardless of your upbringing,

952
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,180
 every person listening right now,

953
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,360
 you were made in the image of God.

954
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,680
 And there's still enough image of God inside of you,

955
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,300
 despite the fact that when sin entered,

956
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,900
 it broke the reflection of God inside of us,

957
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,200
 but it didn't totally do away with it.

958
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,000
 And there's enough image of God inside of you

959
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,280
 that will never be okay with horrific evil taking place.

960
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,360
 In other words, there's no sermon.

961
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,720
 And sometimes as pastors, we're like,

962
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,920
 "Dude, I'm about to give this sermon.

963
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,200
 "It's gonna change everyone's life."

964
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,240
 And you're gonna hear an answer that you're like,

965
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,620
 "Oh, whoa."

966
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,160
 And that's something you hope to do.

967
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,460
 But emotionally, there is no sermon.

968
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,440
 There's no sentence.

969
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,000
 There's no clip you can watch on the internet

970
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,840
 that's gonna make you like,

971
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,960
 "You know, I really had a problem with domestic abuse.

972
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,620
 "And then I saw this and I was like, oh, that's great.

973
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,460
 "I'm okay with it now.

974
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,840
 "'Cause you know, God's up there."

975
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,480
 You're never gonna be okay with that.

976
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,080
 There's no emotionally satisfying answer.

977
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,260
 'Cause you're made in the image of God

978
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,080
 and God is not emotionally satisfied

979
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,600
 with all the brokenness in our world.

980
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,420
 He hates it.

981
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,260
 He grieves over it.

982
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,560
 His heart breaks over it more than any of ours do.

983
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,800
 And he gave his life.

984
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,360
 And in doing so, he shows that.

985
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,880
 And he's not okay with all the horrific pain.

986
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,520
 And one day he's promised, "I will do away with it.

987
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,000
 "And today I wait patiently so that more people

988
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,200
 "for all of eternity will have a relationship with me."

989
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,640
 And his heart breaks over it.

990
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,400
 We see inside of John's gospel,

991
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,800
 this interaction that just shows the incredible tenderness

992
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,720
 and emotional compassion of God.

993
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,520
 It's from John chapter 11, and I'll summarize it.

994
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,820
 We're about to close here.

995
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,880
 In John chapter 11, we're told that Jesus

996
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,320
 has these like three sibling friends.

997
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,800
 Like there's three friends that are all siblings together.

998
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,840
 The name is Lazarus, Martha, and Mary.

999
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,640
 They're like good buddies with Jesus.

1000
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,760
 How cool would that be?

1001
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,360
 Your family is tight with Jesus.

1002
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,400
 And we're told that one of them, Lazarus, gets really sick.

1003
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,760
 And the sisters, they send word to Jesus.

1004
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,540
 They're like, "Hey, Lazarus, the one you love is sick."

1005
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:53,640
 Jesus, we're told, eventually shows up at their house.

1006
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,500
 He comes to them.

1007
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:01,260
 And while they're there, he's told that Lazarus died.

1008
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,640
 He's not alive anymore.

1009
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,840
 And Jesus goes to the tomb,

1010
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,100
 and I just wanna read what happens next.

1011
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,680
 He shows up and he goes to the burial place.

1012
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,000
 It says this, John chapter 11, verse 34.

1013
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,560
 "Where have you laid him?"

1014
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,640
 He asked the sisters.

1015
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,840
 "Where have you put Lazarus?"

1016
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,680
 30-something, maybe 20-something-year-old kid.

1017
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,840
 "Where'd you bury him?"

1018
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,200
 "Come and see, Lord."

1019
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
 And they show up.

1020
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,120
 Outside the tomb, we see Jesus wept.

1021
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,220
 Begins crying and weeping.

1022
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,760
 Jesus, once more deeply moved, he came to the tomb,

1023
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,080
 and it was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.

1024
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,640
 And he said, "Take away the stone."

1025
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,480
 And Jesus shows up.

1026
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,300
 He missed the funeral.

1027
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,580
 He shows up, and they're like,

1028
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,000
 "Jesus, take away the stone."

1029
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,240
 She says, "It's been four days.

1030
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,080
 "By this time, there's a bad odor."

1031
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,360
 And Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believe,

1032
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,160
 "you're gonna see the glory of God?"

1033
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,700
 So they roll the stone away.

1034
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,060
 Then Jesus looked up and he said,

1035
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,960
 "Father, I thank you that you've heard me.

1036
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,980
 "I know you always hear me,

1037
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,080
 "but I said this for the benefit

1038
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,040
 "of the people standing here,

1039
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,440
 "that they may believe you sent me."

1040
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,640
 And when they said this, Jesus called out in a loud voice,

1041
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,400
 "Lazarus, come out!"

1042
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,240
 And the dead man came out,

1043
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,520
 and his hands and his feet were wrapped in strips of linen

1044
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,720
 and cloth around his face.

1045
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,060
 And Jesus said, "Take the grave clothes off of him

1046
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,920
 "and let him go."

1047
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,080
 He comes out and he says, "Take the stone away."

1048
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,880
 And Lazarus comes out at Jesus' invitation

1049
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,360
 and looking like a mummy.

1050
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,680
 He's like, "Take off the clothes,

1051
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,280
 "or take the linens and all the cloths off of him."

1052
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,220
 Here's what's so crazy to me about that story.

1053
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,840
 Why are you weeping?

1054
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,440
 Jesus, you know all things.

1055
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,680
 You knew that you were gonna heal him.

1056
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,440
 You knew exactly what was gonna take place.

1057
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,040
 You weren't surprised by like, "Oh yeah, whoa,

1058
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,720
 "I got the ability to raise people from the dead."

1059
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,240
 You knew everything you were gonna do.

1060
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,360
 You knew that you were about to raise this person

1061
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,200
 from the dead.

1062
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,960
 And you show up and you begin to weep

1063
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,820
 as you see the pain that death had created

1064
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,120
 and the people around you.

1065
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,640
 The reason that he's weeping outside

1066
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
 is because unlike any other person,

1067
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,320
 Jesus knew more fully what it was like

1068
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,800
 to experience a world that is free of sin

1069
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,620
 and death.

1070
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,360
 He's the only person who's ever known a world

1071
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,960
 where there wasn't the presence of death.

1072
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,160
 He's the only person that knows deeper

1073
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,880
 than anyone will ever understand.

1074
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,720
 You were not made to die,

1075
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,640
 or what was not made to experience death.

1076
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,120
 People were not made to bury their 25-year-old brother.

1077
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,940
 And he looks at this group and he's heartbroken.

1078
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,920
 And he knows he's about to raise him from the dead,

1079
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,800
 but he sees and he knows this was never meant

1080
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,640
 to be this way.

1081
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,220
 And the tenderness of Jesus pours out.

1082
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,200
 Whatever you're walking through,

1083
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,920
 whatever you think about the God who's there,

1084
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,920
 he's not distant, he's not uncaring,

1085
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,520
 he's compassionate in everything that you're facing.

1086
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,880
 And just like the sisters of Mary and Martha saw,

1087
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,080
 I mean, how much would that mess with you?

1088
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,680
 You're just raising from the dead and you are crying

1089
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,440
 over the pain in our life.

1090
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,320
 Whatever you're walking through, whatever pain is there,

1091
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,180
 God is not apathetic to you.

1092
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,460
 Whatever you think about him,

1093
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,560
 you cannot conclude that he doesn't care.

1094
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,600
 He cares.

1095
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,840
 He's a God who sits out of tombs

1096
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,200
 that he knows he's about to raise and he cries.

1097
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
 He's a God that cared so much,

1098
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,000
 he gave his life for you on the cross.

1099
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,600
 He's the solution for everything bad in our world.

1100
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,440
 And it doesn't emotionally sit right.

1101
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,560
 Because you're made in the image of that God

1102
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,880
 who cares deeply when people hurt.

1103
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,240
 And he cares through whatever

1104
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,880
 you're walking through right now.

1105
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,700
 And he was the best person

1106
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,780
 who experienced the worst thing happening to him,

1107
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,240
 eternal death, so that you wouldn't have to.

1108
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,940
 If you're listening right now

1109
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,860
 and you've never had a moment,

1110
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,900
 every week we get people that write in and just say,

1111
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,780
 "I've never put my faith in Christ before, but I believe.

1112
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,780
 "I'm starting to believe Jesus is who he says he is.

1113
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
 "He's alive.

1114
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,140
 "And I'm experiencing that change in my life."

1115
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,900
 I want to invite you to do what so many have done,

1116
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,540
 which is begin to put your faith in Christ,

1117
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,220
 begin to ask Jesus,

1118
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,620
 "I want to have a relationship with God.

1119
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,700
 "I'm a sinner.

1120
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,840
 "I'm a bad person.

1121
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,440
 "I don't deserve to go spend eternity with God.

1122
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,600
 "But if what you say is true,

1123
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,060
 "that if I trust in what you did for me on the cross,

1124
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,660
 "and your burial, and your resurrection,

1125
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,960
 "then I'll be forgiven forever?

1126
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,620
 "Then I receive that, and I believe that,

1127
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,900
 "and I accept that.

1128
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,160
 "Come be Lord of my life.

1129
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,220
 "Forgive me, Lord.

1130
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,440
 "Be my Savior, my God.

1131
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,520
 "I believe.

1132
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,380
 "Tonight is your night, wherever you are."

1133
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,320
 And it's just expressing to God,

1134
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,260
 "Man, I'm a sinner.

1135
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,360
 "I don't deserve a relationship with you.

1136
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,980
 "But I, by faith, accept the free gift

1137
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,820
 "that you've given me.

1138
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,000
 "Tonight, you can know that you're gonna experience

1139
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,780
 "a world that will have no bad ever be a part of it.

1140
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:09,140
 "No more pain, no more death.

1141
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,520
 "And you don't have to wonder where you stand with God."

1142
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,380
 If you are walking through a situation or a scenario,

1143
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,700
 I just want to pray for the last group

1144
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,460
 as we transition to a worship song,

1145
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,820
 have a chance for Q and A.

1146
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,500
 Those of you who are listening

1147
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,660
 who are just in a really hard spot,

1148
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,060
 and you're walking through the reality

1149
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,420
 that your job is not coming back,

1150
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,720
 your mom may not make it,

1151
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,000
 you may have been diagnosed with a sickness

1152
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,360
 or an autoimmune or something in your own life,

1153
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,780
 you have parents that their marriage is falling apart

1154
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,780
 or a loved one who maybe has walked away from Christ

1155
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,380
 or whatever you're experiencing,

1156
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,540
 maybe it's a cancer that you were praying,

1157
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,060
 God, please take it away and it's back.

1158
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,540
 I just want to pray for you and pray over you

1159
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,740
 as we walk through this and just ask for God

1160
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,540
 to in a way that I honestly don't even fully know

1161
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,540
 how to ask for, to raise and heighten your awareness.

1162
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,020
 He's not far.

1163
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,260
 He's not apathetic.

1164
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,200
 He's not angry.

1165
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,620
 And he loves you and his heart breaks over the pain

1166
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,320
 in our world and in your life.

1167
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,460
 And just that he would raise your senses

1168
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,260
 and your awareness of his nearness to you,

1169
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,100
 even in this moment.

1170
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,700
 So let me just pray and we'll transition into worship.

1171
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,020
 Father, I do pray for anyone

1172
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:33,020
 who's currently walking through pain.

1173
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,020
 Somebody recently died in their life.

1174
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,980
 The story that they hoped you would write

1175
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,540
 of the job, a career, a marriage,

1176
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:49,820
 their life is not gonna go the way that they hoped it would.

1177
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,260
 They have people around them that are running from you

1178
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,100
 and just whatever they're facing and walking through,

1179
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,180
 God, I do pray that you would supernaturally right now

1180
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,380
 in this moment, you'd raise their awareness

1181
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,740
 of your nearness to them.

1182
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,620
 You would comfort them.

1183
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,260
 You the God of comfort.

1184
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,200
 You would enlarge our hope that is not in this world.

1185
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,480
 It's not in our health.

1186
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,320
 It's not in a person.

1187
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,440
 It's in our God and our savior who was so good.

1188
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,360
 He gave his life for us.

1189
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,220
 And would you help us God?

1190
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,280
 Because in the pains of our life,

1191
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,740
 our emotions can make us question everything

1192
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,680
 and anything around us.

1193
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,320
 So help us God, ground us in truth

1194
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,280
 and ground us in your word, be near to us.

1195
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,280
 And we know that you are.

1196
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,760
 And so raise our awareness and our confidence of that

1197
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,720
 and the truth that you're God,

1198
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,240
 who one day will do away with all evil.

1199
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,520
 And today you've allowed it so that more

1200
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,820
 would come to know you.

1201
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,040
 We worship you in song, amen.

1202
00:47:52,040 --> 00:48:02,040
