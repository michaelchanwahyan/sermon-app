1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 (snaps)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,080
 - Tess Patterson, Porch Stories, Anxiety, take one.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,780
 - So I never went a day of my life

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,920
 where I didn't know who Jesus was,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,440
 but huge difference between knowing who he is

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,520
 and living out a life with him.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,040
 Growing up in a Christian home

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,640
 marked me with a lot of perfectionism.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,600
 I thought I had to be a certain way

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,680
 in order to be loved and accepted.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,540
 And that laced my life with a lot of anxiety

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,920
 and a lot of fear of not being enough

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,400
 and looking for the approval of man.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,120
 Played competitive volleyball for 10 years

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,440
 and that just marked my life.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,280
 I was constantly looking for approval from other people

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,560
 until I decided to hang up my competitive athletic gear

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,000
 and go to college and have a typical college experience

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,940
 and quickly lost my identity

20
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,200
 and so spiraled into an eating disorder

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,560
 and it really just riddled me with a lot more

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,740
 just like fear of not being enough.

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:05,140
 I had a friend who lived on the same floor as me

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,460
 who just loved the Lord.

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,660
 Her life marked something different

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,160
 that I was like, I want that.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,140
 It was a sense of hope, it was a sense of peace

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,900
 that I had been searching for

29
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,380
 and so she invited me to a Bible study

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,580
 and I heard the gospel in a new way that night.

31
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,820
 Went home and just my life was just radically transformed.

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,420
 I just felt God just captivate my heart and say,

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,580
 "Hey Tess, I have more for you in your life

34
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,860
 "than how you're currently living."

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,220
 And it just provided me with that hope and that peace

36
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,120
 that there's just something more to my identity

37
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,060
 than what this world has to offer.

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,980
 And so my life, since giving my life to the Lord

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,540
 has just looked like there's a sense of peace

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,620
 and hope and assurity

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,940
 and something so much greater and so much more.

42
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,780
 And it's just so sweet to live on mission every single day

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,220
 saying, "God I know that you are using me

44
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,460
 "to bring glory to your name

45
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,380
 "and that I get to show more people

46
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,940
 "where true hope, true life,

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,620
 "and true just love and peace and security is found."

48
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,460
 And so every day we get to live more knowing

49
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,300
 that I am fully known and fully loved

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,020
 by the one who matters most.

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,600
 (upbeat music)

52
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,180
 (upbeat music)

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,760
 (upbeat music)

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,260
 (music fades)

55
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:33,260
