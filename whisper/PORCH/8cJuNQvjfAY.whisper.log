[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:27.240]   - Well, hi Porsche.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.480]   My name is Harrison Ross
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.140]   and I'm excited to be back with you tonight.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.520]   Thank you.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.200]   Yay for you.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000]   Why not?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   Hey, so we're in a series called Mood.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.140]   You just saw that.
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.220]   And last week, Dave and Marvin kicked us off
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.540]   and he gave us this overview,
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.160]   kicking us into the series,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.240]   talking about for the next few weeks,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.760]   what does the Bible have to say about emotions?
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.600]   We all have them.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.040]   It's a human experience.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.760]   We all experience these emotions and these feelings.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.680]   And so what do we do with it?
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560]   And all of us experience different things.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.440]   Some of us cross over and have similar emotions.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.960]   Sometimes we experience similar things or different things
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.800]   and experience different emotions.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.180]   Sometimes that's subjective,
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.580]   but there are a few things that are not subjective.
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.880]   When you are placed in that place or that experience,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.440]   it evokes something in you, a feeling, an emotion.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.400]   If you don't believe me,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.720]   what happens when you see these images right here?
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.640]   Where are you?
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.520]   Yes, vacation.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.920]   Everything away from what you hate right now.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.520]   Your job, your life,
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.040]   you're sitting there with a Corona in hand
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   or a virgin mocktail for those that are out there.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.860]   And you're just living a dream.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200]   You're loving life.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.120]   You're completely sunburned
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.160]   'cause you're convinced I can get away with it.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.200]   I'm young.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600]   I don't have leathery skin.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.040]   I'll be fine.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.680]   Said everyone else.
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.840]   And you look like a lobster,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.760]   but you're on the beach and life is good.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.120]   It fills you with delight and joy.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.460]   Maybe the beach isn't your scene.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.060]   You're into mountains or maybe this is your scene.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.440]   College football season.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.480]   (audience cheering)
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.520]   Oh goodness.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   I knew that would happen.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.240]   This is a terrible choice.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.160]   But here you are.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.100]   You're at the game.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.940]   It's game day.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.980]   You're excited.
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.600]   Maybe you're in the season
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.720]   and your team's winning.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.640]   The Aggies aren't my team.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   And you know, that experience where you're there,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.720]   you're there together and they throw that long pass
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.200]   and you're like biting your nails
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   and your girlfriend's like, "Why are we here?"
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.000]   And you're just like, you're in that moment
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.880]   and they score.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.280]   You know, Dale Beckham's, he reaches out
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.120]   and he's like, (imitates gun firing)
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.200]   and he breaks his collarbone.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.800]   And you're like, "Yeah!"
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.160]   You're high-fiving.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.860]   It fills you with joy.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.400]   Or maybe more than sports,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.720]   you just love to watch your team lose.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.800]   I hate the Aggies.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.520]   I find joy.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.360]   It's fine.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.440]   (audience cheering)
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920]   I find joy when the Aggies lose
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.080]   and I go, "Yeah, you just got whooped!
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.040]   "Whoop that!"
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.960]   It's amazing.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.480]   It fills me with joy.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.600]   Maybe different feelings.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.000]   But sports do that.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.400]   Now maybe neither of those things are your thing.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   But universally, we all know
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.720]   that this fills us with joy.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   Puppies, oh I know.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.880]   It's just like, oh my goodness!
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.920]   Ah!
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.680]   It just doesn't matter who you are.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.360]   Now there's a reason we didn't put cats up there
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.780]   because cats are divisive.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.580]   Cats are disgusting.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.200]   If you're a cat person, I'm not saying you're disgusting.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.560]   Hiss away, you're an Aggie, that's fine.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.040]   But we love puppies!
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.740]   We love puppies!
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.440]   They're just cute and cuddly.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.680]   The problem is they grow into dogs
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.080]   and then they eat everything.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.440]   But we see these things and it gives us this feeling,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.080]   this emotion that we all can relate to.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's joy.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.120]   This feeling of joy.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.400]   And we want it.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   And then we spend our life chasing it
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.840]   from experience to experience.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.140]   And so tonight, we're gonna look at how can we have joy?
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.660]   Because here's the problem.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.960]   Life's not just vacations and football games and puppies.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.320]   Life's a beach.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.000]   Maybe life's a beach when you're there
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.040]   one or two weeks of the year,
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.360]   but everything else, it's hard!
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's difficult!
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.740]   It's sometimes boring!
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.820]   And your team loses!
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.140]   And it's not always elation and joy
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.100]   and you're allergic to puppies!
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.860]   It doesn't fill you with joy!
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.560]   And you get rejected.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.240]   But the guy or the girl that you care most about,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.940]   they don't want you.
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.660]   Or you don't get that job that you wanted.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.580]   You get turned down for that job.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.740]   Or you can't even get a job.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.060]   Or you start looking through Instagram
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.620]   and your life looks nothing else like everyone else's life.
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.120]   Or maybe if you're honest,
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.660]   your life looks nothing like you thought it would
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.800]   when you got to this point in your life.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.220]   You're not Drake, 25, sitting on 25 mil.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.680]   That's not your life.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.820]   But through all of this,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.660]   maybe you're not one of those things.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.220]   Maybe you've gotten everything you've ever wanted
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.580]   and still you don't have joy.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.380]   Maybe you are like Jake.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.660]   Maybe you've got millions, you've got success,
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.260]   you've got status, you've got that guy or girl,
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.580]   and it's leaving you empty.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.020]   You know what the Bible says?
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.980]   The Bible says that regardless
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.020]   of where you are on that spectrum,
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.140]   regardless if you've had the best life
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.340]   and everybody wants it,
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.580]   or you've had the worst life
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.340]   and no one wants to be in your shoes,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.140]   the Bible says you can have joy.
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:22.100]   And so tonight we're gonna look at how do we have joy.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.020]   We're gonna look at what is joy,
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.180]   what keeps us from having joy,
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.920]   and then how can I have it?
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.620]   So first, what is joy?
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.860]   Joy in the dictionary is defined as this,
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.420]   a feeling of great pleasure and happiness.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.740]   Yeah, describes what we feel when we see it.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.540]   Oftentimes when the Bible speaks of that feeling
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.160]   or emotion or experience, it talks about delight.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.420]   All throughout the scriptures, it speaks of delight,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.020]   111 times throughout the Bible.
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.680]   And delight is synonymous.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.700]   It's the same thing as joy, happiness,
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.140]   satisfaction, extreme pleasure, and fulfillment.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.340]   Psalm 37, four, it says,
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.320]   "Delight yourself in the Lord,
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.720]   "and He will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.760]   Happiness, joy, fulfillment, extreme pleasure,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.280]   satisfaction, this feeling we all want.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.220]   But I wanna shatter something for you.
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.280]   Joy isn't just something you wake up
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.800]   and you're like, "Oh, it's a great day, hurrah!"
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.280]   And then the music starts playing
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.080]   and you start high-fiving everybody.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.280]   That's what we all want,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.620]   is it just to kind of happen to us.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.520]   But joy isn't a mood, it's a choice.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.040]   Joy is not something that's just going to happen to you.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.720]   Joy is something you choose to walk in.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.680]   And I'm gonna explain that through the rest of this message.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.400]   Joy is not a mood, it is a choice.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.640]   What this scripture says, again,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.640]   delight is a synonym with joy.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.320]   It doesn't say, "Oh, you're gonna have joy,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.280]   "you're gonna feel joy, you're gonna feel delight."
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.520]   It's not a noun, it's not something that we're pursuing,
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.120]   it's something that we pursue, to delight in,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.880]   to find joy in, another synonym, to enjoy.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.760]   It's not a mood, joy is not a mood, it's a choice.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.000]   Because what you're looking for is happiness.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.820]   Most of the time when we say,
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.360]   "Oh, I want joy and I wanna be joyful."
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   What you mean is, "I wanna be happy.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.840]   "I want what I want.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.020]   "I want everything in my life to go really, really well
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.980]   "so that I can be awesome and beautiful
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.960]   "and everyone will love me."
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.660]   And we can giggle, but we all feel it.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.320]   What you're looking for is not joy,
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.000]   the mood you want is happiness.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.960]   That's not joy, joy is completely different.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.960]   It's not happiness,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.480]   because happiness is dependent on our circumstances.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.700]   Happiness is dependent on everything going well,
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.500]   or me winning the lottery,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.500]   or me blowing a red light and not getting in a wreck.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.100]   I'm like, "Oh, yes, ha ha ha."
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.660]   It's dependent on my circumstance.
[00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.220]   Joy has nothing to do with my circumstance,
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.340]   it has everything to do with my Savior.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.940]   It's not dependent on everything around me,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.580]   I can have joy regardless of what's happening in my life.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.400]   That's what the Scripture teaches all over the place,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.340]   because joy isn't a mood, it's different.
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.260]   It's a choice, and if you don't believe me,
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.660]   people do this all the time.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.300]   I mean, you can think of people whose life is in shambles,
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.540]   and they have a smile on their face,
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.180]   not because they're faking happiness,
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.920]   because they have something that maybe we don't have.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.960]   Or they're going through a terrible situation,
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.500]   they're going through a terrible sickness in their family,
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.060]   and these people have something, it's hope.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.260]   And in that, they can choose to have joy.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.140]   When I was in, a few years ago,
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.740]   my wife, she has three siblings,
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.260]   and one of her brothers died in a motorcycle accident,
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.420]   out of nowhere, random, catastrophic.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.420]   And in most families where a death occurs,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.900]   not only is that hard to deal with,
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.520]   but it breaks the family apart.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.140]   Many divorce, I mean, the divorce rates skyrockets,
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.380]   siblings start to just gripe with each other
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.980]   and hate each other.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.600]   But I saw something different in my father-in-law.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.660]   He stood strong, and he chose to have joy
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.500]   in the midst of a terrible circumstance.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.600]   No one wakes up and goes, "I hope my son dies today,
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.240]   "because I'd love to have joy."
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   But regardless of his circumstance, he chose joy.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.920]   Not because everything was good,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.760]   but because he chose the goodness of God
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.100]   in the midst of everything being terrible.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.600]   If you look at the scriptures,
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.500]   and Paul is going all over the Grecian world,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.240]   and he is getting just persecuted,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.960]   and put in prison, and beaten, and he sings.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.280]   That's crazy.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.040]   He's sitting there, he and Silas are chained to a wall,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.480]   not just like, "Man, this is a bummer again."
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.720]   They're probably elevated, hung by their arms and their legs
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.920]   hanging on a wall, probably thinking they're going to die,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.760]   and they're worshiping God.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.880]   Not 'cause they're like, "This is awesome, God,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.600]   "we have a house, a roof over our head."
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.820]   It's terrible, but they chose joy,
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.920]   regardless of their circumstance.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.840]   And there are scriptures, there are stories
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.680]   throughout the Bible that show the same thing.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.760]   Because Paul had it figured out.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.440]   Joy is not from his circumstance, it's from his contentment.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.880]   That God is who he says he is,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.240]   that he's gonna do what he says he's gonna do,
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.320]   even if it doesn't happen in this life.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.180]   And in that, he can have joy.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.860]   Philippians 4, 11 through 13.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.800]   Hold on, before I read it.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.040]   Some people know probably Philippians 4, 13.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.120]   Uh, apparently I don't.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.200]   (laughing)
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.360]   I could do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.060]   Yeah, you see the college football players
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.960]   put it on their eye black, or the high school players,
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.120]   they're like, "Yeah, I'm bad."
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.300]   And they just are like, "Man, we're gonna do it,
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:46.280]   "we're gonna win this season, 'cause we've got God, yes!"
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.440]   And we take it completely out of context,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.920]   it's not what it means.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   This is the context, Philippians 4, verse 11.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.320]   "Not that I'm speaking of being in need,
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.240]   "for I have learned in whatever situation
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.780]   "I am to be content.
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.240]   "I know how to be brought low, I know how to abound.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.180]   "And in every circumstance, I have learned the secret
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.180]   "of facing plenty, and hunger, abundance, and in need.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:14.460]   "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:20.620]   Joy is not a mood, it is a choice.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.520]   But what keeps us from having joy?
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.400]   What keeps us from choosing that?
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.320]   I think the biggest thing is we choose the wrong things.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.720]   We always have a choice, but choosing joy is not easy.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.760]   Choosing joy is not often fun.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.360]   Choosing joy isn't most of our first steps.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.240]   We choose these other things, because like I read earlier
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.200]   in Psalm 37, four, it says that we can delight in him
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.840]   and he'll fulfill the desires of our heart,
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.740]   but I think we flip it around.
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:58.000]   Because too often we look for our desires
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   to bring us delight, but God has created us to delight
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.020]   in him and he will fulfill our desires.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.840]   Too often we think, if I go chase what I want,
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.560]   I go chase what I think I need,
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.800]   I go chase what my heart is telling me and I'm feeling,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.540]   I'll have joy.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.640]   That's not what this verse says.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.500]   That's not what the scriptures teach.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.820]   That if I choose to enjoy him, I choose to have joy
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.260]   in Christ, I'll have everything I could ever ask,
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:34.780]   or think, or imagine, but we choose the wrong things.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.960]   We're focused on the wrong things.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.980]   We become focused on our feelings,
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.080]   what we think our heart wants, what our heart's telling us.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.460]   Just, man, whatever your heart says, just go do that.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.660]   I don't know, what's your heart telling you?
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.260]   I don't know, it tells me something different every hour
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.780]   and I can't tell if it's heartburn.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.940]   But we get focused on our feelings
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.220]   and we chase these experiences.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.620]   We chase these highs to give us something,
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.740]   thinking if I just chase my feeling,
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.460]   then I'll have what I want,
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.860]   and we chase the highs, the party life,
[00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.820]   the weekend warrior, the next promotion,
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.820]   the next relationship, and we just pursue our emotions,
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.000]   our emotional experiences, and that happens
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.720]   in the Christian life all the time,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.820]   even in pursuing godly things.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.680]   We want that great worship experience,
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.400]   we wanna feel close to God.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.480]   I hear all the time, I just,
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.920]   I don't know that I feel God's there.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.560]   It's 'cause you're focused on the wrong things.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.880]   You're focused on what you feel.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.720]   You're not focused on God.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:44.680]   We're focused on the wrong things, our feelings,
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   or our flesh, not just what we feel, but what we want,
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.900]   what we desire, the carnal nature within us.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.740]   We just want what we want.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.460]   You don't withhold anything.
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.500]   Anything that you want, you go after it.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.980]   It's like a buffet.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.600]   I love buffets.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.640]   You're just like, give me a plate and give me another.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.620]   Give me that tray so I can go four on there.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.540]   You just take it 'cause you can and you want it.
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.900]   I lived my life that way for so long.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.180]   I was addicted to pornography for 12 years,
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.880]   and part of that struggle is because
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.760]   I just chased what I wanted.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.040]   I chased what I thought would give me pleasure,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.740]   would give me life, would fill me with something,
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.220]   'cause I wasn't feeling joy.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:36.480]   It's those impulse actions, those things we jump at
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.760]   because we just think we want it.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.700]   We become focused on our feeling, on our flesh.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.840]   And when we do that, when we chase our desires,
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.380]   that doesn't lead to delight.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.700]   It doesn't lead to joy.
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.520]   It leads to despair.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.820]   And then spiritually, it just leaves us jaded
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.660]   because many of us in this room, you go,
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.100]   well, hey, I love Jesus, but I don't feel joy.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.700]   I wanna try to choose joy, but I don't feel that
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:12.300]   because we become focused on the wrong things
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.460]   instead of the pursuit of our God.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.060]   The last one that we focus wrongly is in just fantasy.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.820]   What I mean by fantasy is not just where our mind
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.900]   can go sexually, but just this world
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.120]   that really isn't reality.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.500]   We just get distracted.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.580]   We live in a world that's got more devices
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.260]   and more stuff that can take our attention
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260]   and more pings and alerts and blah, bing, bing, bing.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.140]   Like, I hate wearing an Apple Watch anymore
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.400]   'cause I'm just like, wow, do I have arthritis?
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.140]   I'm just buzzing all the time.
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.020]   And we just get distracted.
[00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.020]   The glow of our phone, the constant Instagram feed,
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.360]   Netflix, what everyone else has and we don't.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.140]   Then there are some of you in this room that you go,
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.860]   well, I've got joy.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:02.980]   I don't need God.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.260]   I feel joy all the time.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.620]   I'm living with my boyfriend.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.900]   Life is good.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.900]   I got one red check, boy.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.380]   I don't need anything else.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.620]   I've got joy.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.460]   I don't need God.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.480]   Okay.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.400]   Again, I'd say, I think you may have some happiness.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.560]   And can you have happiness outside of godly things?
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.860]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.440]   But it's not gonna last.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.860]   It's not joy.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.580]   It's not a constant state of being,
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.060]   regardless of your circumstance.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.140]   That's completely dependent on your circumstance.
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.340]   And some of you that are saying,
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.660]   hey, I've got joy and I don't need God.
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.540]   Friend of mine uses an illustration.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.420]   It's like free falling.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.840]   If we just took a video of someone just like,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.860]   (yells)
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.620]   skydiving and no parachute, you'd be like,
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.600]   wow, they're living the dream.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.900]   Until they hit the ground.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.060]   Or they're jumping from building to building.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.620]   When you're suspended in free fall
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.980]   and it seems like you've got no care in the world,
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.580]   that's great.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.420]   But eventually, there's another side.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.660]   What I'd tell you is if you're here
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.980]   and you think that you can have joy outside of Jesus,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.020]   then you're missing out on what God's got for you.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.660]   Eternity's coming.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.200]   And it's not a scare tactic.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.700]   Because that's there, Jesus pursues you and he loves you
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.600]   and he wants you to know him so you can have joy.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.520]   But we get focused on the wrong thing.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.020]   Second Corinthians 4:18.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.700]   As we look not to the things that are seen
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.420]   but to the things that are unseen.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.280]   For the things that are seen are transient
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.140]   but the things that are unseen are eternal.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.640]   We get so focused on here, so focused on me,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.120]   so focused on what I feel, on my flesh and what it wants
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.980]   and on this fantasy that we wanna create
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.360]   that we miss out on an eternal perspective.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.800]   John Piper asks it this way.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   If you could have all the pleasures in this world or God,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.220]   what would you choose?
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:16.480]   Like if you could have your dream job,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.780]   you could have more money
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.960]   than you could ever imagine you could ever have.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   You could have the hottest wife or the hottest husband
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.240]   and however many kids you want
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.620]   or whatever lifestyle you want,
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.800]   if you could choose that right now,
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.200]   snap your fingers and have it.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.220]   Or you could have God and have none of it ever again.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.820]   What would you choose?
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.460]   I know what I should choose
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.380]   but I know what I wanna choose.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.460]   I know where my feelings take me.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.020]   I know where my circumstances make me wanna go find joy
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.780]   in everything around me.
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.560]   I know I can choose Jesus.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.180]   I know I can choose God theologically, conceptually
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.060]   but really what I want?
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.100]   I want fame.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.280]   I want security.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.960]   I want those experiences of elation and excitement.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.220]   I wanna feel God.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.220]   I will do that at the expense
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.700]   of even deepening my relationship with Jesus
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.120]   because I want what I want.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:23.080]   I know what I should choose
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.460]   but I know what I wanna choose.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.300]   And you know what?
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.420]   I'm so glad Jesus didn't
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.720]   'cause he had the same choice I did.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.320]   He's the same choice that we all did
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.760]   to choose this world or something far greater.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.600]   And when he could choose to be the ruler
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.120]   of all that was here, he knew he already was
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.020]   and so he rejected that and he chose me and he chose you.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.640]   What keeps us from having joy
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   is we are consumed with everything else in our life
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.200]   instead of being consumed with the one thing
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.160]   that will give us life.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.460]   Jesus.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.500]   So how do you have joy?
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.460]   You choose Jesus.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.920]   You're like, okay, thank you.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.200]   Glad I showed up.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.040]   What a Bible answer.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.940]   And it may seem like it's not enough
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.440]   but that's what God gives us all throughout the scriptures.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.200]   That's why Jesus came.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.600]   That's why he came and dwelt among us.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.040]   That's why he died.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.840]   And honestly, as I'm preparing this message,
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.440]   I'm wrestling with, well, how can I have joy?
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.800]   How can I delight in the Lord?
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.320]   I don't really know.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.000]   Sometimes it's this like ethereal idea
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.280]   but I'm called to do it and I can have it because of Jesus.
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.860]   Not in what I get from him,
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.600]   not in what I feel when I choose to follow him faithfully
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.720]   but because of him.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.680]   I've been married to my wife for eight years.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.000]   When I started dating her, well, before I started dating her
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.440]   I would see her in the halls.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.760]   I'm like, man, that girl's cute.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.580]   I'd see her more and more.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.320]   I was like, man, that girl's got something going on.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.840]   That girl is attractive.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.160]   And so I asked her out.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.600]   We went on a couple dates and I just had fun with her.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.960]   I enjoyed her.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.360]   She made me laugh.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.800]   I enjoyed our conversation.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.660]   I enjoyed being with her.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.560]   And so I went and asked her dad, bought a ring,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.840]   got down on one knee and I asked her to marry me.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   I didn't ask her to marry me so I could get a tax write-off.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.120]   It's ridiculous.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.760]   I didn't ask her to marry me so that I could come home
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.220]   and have dinner every night.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.020]   I didn't ask her to marry me so that I could have babies.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:50.000]   I didn't marry her because I have a California king bed
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.920]   that's way too big for one person.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.640]   I didn't marry her because I love to spend twice as much
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.780]   on every meal when we go out to eat.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.520]   I married her because I love her.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.320]   I married her because I choose her, because I enjoy her.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.760]   I delight in her.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   I didn't marry her for the things I can get from her.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.680]   I married her for her.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:19.320]   I married her because I enjoy her.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.260]   So what is the experience of enjoying God like?
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.760]   What does it practically look like to have satisfaction
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.520]   and fulfillment in God?
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.880]   It's the joy of knowing the person of God
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.240]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.040]   It's not in what God can give you.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.960]   It's not in what he's gonna do for you.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.680]   It's what he's already done for you.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.760]   It's what Jesus has done on the cross.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.280]   And it didn't stop there.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.080]   He defeated sin and death.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.440]   He is the only person that rose from the grave
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   and never died again.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   And he did that so that you could have life in him
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.900]   by having a relationship with the living God.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.240]   And in that is fullness of joy.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.400]   Psalm 16, 11 says that very thing.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.460]   You make known to me the path of life.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.200]   In your presence, there is fullness of joy.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.600]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.880]   The enjoyment of God is the enjoyment
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.000]   of the person of Jesus.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.600]   I already said it earlier,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.040]   but our joy is not found in our circumstances.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.440]   Our joy is dependent on our Savior.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.000]   Our joy is the pursuit, not of our desires,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.520]   but the pursuit of the God of the universe, Jesus Christ,
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.280]   who loves you, who gave himself for you.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.580]   Because you wanna know something that's crazy?
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.240]   He finds joy in you.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.680]   He delights in you.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.800]   The reason you can have joy
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.920]   is because he's the one that's pursuing you.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.020]   And when you choose Jesus, you have him.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.720]   Jesus didn't just die so that I could go to heaven.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.400]   Oh, I'm so thankful that I get to spend eternity with him.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.600]   Jesus didn't just die so that I don't have to go to hell,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.680]   although I'm glad I don't have to spend forever
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.480]   eternally separated from him.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.000]   Jesus didn't just die so that I don't have to have sin
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.320]   rule my life anymore, although I'm so grateful.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.160]   Jesus died to give me God,
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.560]   the greatest thing I could ever imagine.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.640]   He died so that I could have God.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.200]   The spirit of God, if I believe in him, dwells in me.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.400]   His power is fully present in me.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.880]   And for all who believe, that's crazy.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.020]   And that is our source of joy.
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.520]   So how do you have joy?
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.460]   It's through relationship with Jesus.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.400]   When I say choose Jesus, it's not just like,
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   all right, Jesus, step in, buddy.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.200]   Come on, let's take out dating.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.520]   Jesus, you're in.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:20.720]   I choose to walk in him.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.600]   I choose to have relationship with him,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.340]   to link my life to his life,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.800]   to choose that he will be the source of my life,
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.920]   the source of my power, because I submit myself to him.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.040]   John 15 says this.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.160]   He says, "Abide in me, and I in you,
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.080]   "as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.580]   "unless it abides in the vine,
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.300]   "neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.500]   "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.700]   "Whoever abides in me and I in him,
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.020]   "he it is that bears much fruit,
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:55.860]   "for apart from me you can do nothing."
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.520]   Jesus died so that we could be reconciled to God.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   We could be made in right relationship with him,
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.660]   to love him and be loved by him through relationship.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.480]   And joy is a product of that relationship,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.960]   not something we go searching for in our desires
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.040]   and our pleasures and whatever.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.520]   It is a fruit of staying connected to Jesus.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.600]   It is the produce.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.720]   That's what fruit is in the grocery store,
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.640]   unless you all just like Walmart pickup and Amazon it,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.760]   you've never been to a grocery store,
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.960]   but it is what comes from the vine.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.680]   Joy is a product of a relationship with Jesus,
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.920]   and so how do we have that relationship?
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.600]   We spend time in his word.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.160]   First, you gotta believe.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.680]   You gotta believe that he's the savior of your life.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.720]   You gotta believe that what he did on the cross
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.240]   is enough for you to satisfy your deepest needs,
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.020]   that you don't have to chase it in this world,
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.160]   but you can choose him.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.520]   And then you can daily sit in scripture
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.280]   and be reminded of his promises.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.480]   We just sang that song at the end,
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.200]   to rest in his promises.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.920]   We don't read this because it's a playbook
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.480]   that's gonna make me a better person.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.240]   That's not Christianity.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.160]   That's not why we love Jesus.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.400]   I read this so that I can be reminded
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.660]   of who God is and how he loves me.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.780]   When I read this and I rest in his promises,
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.080]   I know that I'm loved,
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.160]   that I'm accepted,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.960]   that I'm forgiven, I'm wanted,
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.880]   I'm a part of something, I matter to God.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.680]   I'm a child of God.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.720]   And in that, I find great joy,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.080]   fullness of pleasure,
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.520]   pleasures forevermore.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.720]   So we do that through his word, through his people,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.540]   community that's all around us, his church,
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.500]   because we forget.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.720]   We gotta remind each other, encourage each other.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.560]   And then as I said earlier, his spirit is within you.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.320]   And as we abide in him, as we remain in him
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.100]   and find joy in him, have relationship with him,
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:12.220]   then joy is the product.
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.820]   And so how do I delight in the Lord?
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.080]   Let me just simplify it way more.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.760]   How do I delight in the Lord?
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.400]   Practically, how does that look?
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.480]   How do I live it out?
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.600]   What's my next step instead of this ideological thing?
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:30.880]   One of the ways is just do what makes you love God more.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.360]   And again, that may sound crazy,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.720]   but some of y'all are trying to find joy
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.040]   in a relationship with Jesus
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.320]   by doing things you don't really enjoy.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.880]   We've kind of gone in these Christian circles of,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.240]   okay, I've gotta have a two-hour quiet time.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.960]   I'm really gonna be a religious person
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.640]   and I've gotta memorize all of these texts
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.120]   and I've gotta go through these things
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.920]   and I've gotta make sure I don't miss church on Sundays.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.360]   And you're miserable
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.120]   'cause you don't enjoy it.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.120]   Now, are those things bad?
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.200]   No, they're life-giving.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.740]   We've gotta stay rooted in his word and connected to him.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.700]   We need to fellowship with other believers
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.720]   and worship with them.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   But don't just do what everyone else is doing.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.340]   Do what you love.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.840]   One of the ways to do the things
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.340]   that make you love God more is do what you love.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.220]   I'm not a guy that likes to just sit for four hours
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.920]   in scripture and read Leviticus.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.140]   I'm like, oh.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.920]   Whatever.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.160]   I love to be behind a boat on a wakeboard.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.520]   When I get up at a sunrise and I'm standing behind a boat,
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.880]   my legs are throbbing because I need to work out.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.400]   And it is just a glassy lake.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.980]   That's worship for me.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.120]   I am connected to the Father.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:50.140]   I am close to him and worshiping in his creation,
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.560]   in the mountains, in a starry sky.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.320]   What is it that you love to do?
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.400]   Worship him in that.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.680]   First Corinthians 10 says, "Whether you eat or drink,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.000]   "whatever you do, do it for the glory of the Lord."
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.280]   Worship him.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.080]   Joy in the Lord doesn't just come from godly things.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.480]   Everything that brings us joy and delight and happiness
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.620]   is given by God.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.920]   So enjoy him in the things that you enjoy.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.960]   And then do what you're good at.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.060]   Duh.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.880]   He made you that way.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.440]   And some of you, again, are you just trying
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.680]   to fit yourself in this box?
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.840]   You don't have to fit in a box.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.740]   He made you uniquely.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.600]   Maybe you love to do art.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.320]   Maybe you love accounting.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.040]   I don't know why.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.680]   But God bless you, he's made you to love numbers.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.680]   Then go do that.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.320]   The other way that the scripture says this
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.760]   is to use your gifts.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.080]   Maybe you love to encourage people or to serve people
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.680]   or to invite them into your home.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.960]   Do those things for the glory of the Lord,
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.120]   to wrap it all up.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.940]   Choose Jesus and choose joy.
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.300]   Joy isn't just this selfish pursuit
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.720]   that if I go and find what I want, then I'll have joy.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.760]   It's in Jesus.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.680]   The Clemson football coach,
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.300]   when they won the national championship last year,
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.660]   he said a quote.
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:15.260]   He said, "Well, I just try to have joy."
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.340]   Here's what joy is.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.380]   Jesus first, others, and then you.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.740]   He just says, "It, our source of joy,"
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.340]   that spells joy, by the way,
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.020]   "Our source of joy is Jesus.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.060]   "And from our joy in Jesus,
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.940]   "it then leads us to serve and love others."
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.660]   Not just serve and love ourselves,
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.060]   but most of us flip it around and we have yaj.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.940]   No one wants yaj.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.540]   They want joy.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.940]   It's not about you.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.860]   And it's not about hanging with other people
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.220]   so that you feel better about you
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.220]   and then somewhere Jesus fits in.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.300]   That's backwards.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.660]   How do you have joy?
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.400]   Choose Jesus and live in relationship with him.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.680]   And guys, there are some people in this room
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.380]   who are going through really hard circumstances.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.180]   And as we addressed earlier, circumstances are real.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.100]   And it isn't just this pithy thing to go,
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.740]   "Well, just get over it and choose joy."
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.900]   Those are really hard.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.460]   And one of the ways that the Bible
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.420]   reminds God's people continually of who he is
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.120]   is when they gather together like this and they rejoice.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.620]   They don't just stand there and just go, "My life sucks.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.200]   "I hate it.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.800]   "Yeah, you tell me how much your life's terrible."
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.100]   They gather together and they focus on God.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.340]   And they rejoice in who he is
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.100]   and they rejoice in his promises.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.460]   Rejoice, what that word means is to take great pleasure
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.500]   and joy and delight in and take action.
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.740]   It's to worship.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.060]   It's to sing whenever you're chained on the wall
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.020]   or your life is in shambles.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.460]   And if you're here and that is your circumstance,
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.220]   then listen to the people of God sing over you
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.940]   the truth of who God is and how he loves you.
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.060]   We're gonna sing Psalm 34.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.740]   Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.800]   Blessed is he who hides in him.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.740]   It's not just this far off idea.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.580]   It is something that if you choose it, you taste it,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.820]   you will see the goodness of God
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.360]   lived out fully in your life.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.820]   Let me pray and then we'll sing.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.500]   Heavenly Father, thank you for Jesus.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.100]   Thank you that we don't have to walk this earth
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:33.960]   trying to figure it out.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.100]   We don't have to walk this earth
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.900]   trying to make ourselves better or more lovely
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.700]   or more good or gooder.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.300]   We can trust you.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.420]   We can choose you.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.220]   We can choose life in you
[00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.060]   because when you were here, you said,
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.940]   "I have come that you may have life and life abundantly,
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.940]   "life to the full, life with fullness of joy."
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.260]   And Lord, we're easily distracted
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.100]   by all the things in our life where our feelings take us,
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.520]   where we wanna place our focus
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.460]   and what we wanna choose that isn't you.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.000]   And so Lord, help us.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.220]   Help us find eternal life in you.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.020]   Help us choose to have life in you today and tomorrow
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.220]   regardless of what's going on around us.
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.880]   Thank you, Lord, that you chose us,
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.500]   not for what we've done or what we could do,
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.700]   but because you loved us, that we are your joy.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.700]   And because you chose us, we can choose to find joy in you.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.820]   Lord, we worship you.
