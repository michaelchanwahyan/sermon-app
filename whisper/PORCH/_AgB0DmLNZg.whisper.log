[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:25.760]   Well, what's up, Porch?
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.840]   How are we doing tonight?
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.320]   Hey, it's so good to see you, whether you're
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.160]   here in the room here in Dallas or you're
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.000]   watching at one of our Porch Live locations.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.680]   Want to just give a shout out right now to our Porch Live
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.480]   location in Fort Worth.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480]   Also the one in Midland watching tonight.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.520]   Indianapolis, Boise, so glad you're tuning in.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.320]   This is your first time ever at the Porch.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.480]   My name's Timothy Atik, and I'm one of the teaching pastors
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.400]   here at Watermark on Sundays as well as Tuesday nights.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.080]   If you don't know what you just stepped into,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.560]   if you feel like you've gotten tricked into being here,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.480]   like let me just tell you what you stepped into,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.040]   the Porch exists to call any and every young adult to see Jesus.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.960]   That's what our hope is for you tonight,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.760]   that you would see the beauty of Jesus Christ
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.160]   and that you would believe that it is worth it to surrender
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.880]   your life fully to him.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.800]   And so here at the Porch, like we
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.080]   believe that the Bible is the word of God.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.160]   Like we believe that God has gone to great lengths
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.240]   to give us this book.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.560]   And when we open this book, it's like God is speaking to us.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.020]   And so every week that we gather,
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.880]   we take this word seriously.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.840]   We want to study it.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   We want to know it, because we believe that this
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   is how God speaks to us today.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.520]   And so I want you to just think about that,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.160]   whether you're an atheist in the room or an agnostic,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.240]   or you're a student at Dallas Seminary right now.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.640]   Wherever you're at, God wants to speak to you tonight.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.080]   And so if that's the case, here's
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.800]   what I want to ask you to do just very quickly.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.760]   I want to invite you to just take a moment
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.840]   and pray for yourself.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.680]   And just say this.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.760]   Say, God, speak to me tonight.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.560]   Just pray that real quick.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.200]   Just say, God, speak to me tonight.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.280]   And if you've never talked to God, just say, God,
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.240]   if you're real, then I want you to speak to me.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:40.800]   Lord, thank you that you are not a God that sits far off,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.040]   but that you're a God that has moved near to us,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.960]   so much so that you left heaven and came
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.640]   to earth in the person of Jesus Christ to draw near to us.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.160]   And you've given us your word so that we can open it and hear
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.660]   from you.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.560]   We don't have to wonder what you're thinking.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.240]   We don't have to wonder whether you love us or not.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.320]   You've given us your word so we can hear from you.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.440]   So speak to us tonight.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.240]   We need you.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.280]   We love you.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.120]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.880]   I think that was a dog barking, which is awesome for the porch.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.160]   Everyone is welcome.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.760]   So for me, it was college when I really found my people.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.120]   Like when I showed up to Texas A&M University
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.680]   my freshman year, I met a group of guys
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.120]   that would be the people that I spent all of my time with
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.000]   at A&M. And then they are the people that have become
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.680]   lifelong friends for me.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.400]   These were the people that I took spontaneous road trips
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.880]   with.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000]   These were the guys that I went to Kyle Field with,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.520]   cheering the Aggies.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.080]   These are the guys that I had prank wars with.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.600]   Like these were the guys that I crushed up fiber pills
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.360]   and put it in their protein supplements
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.080]   to kind of help their plumbing along.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.840]   Like these were some of my closest friends.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.000]   Even as I was preparing for this,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.080]   I thought about this one time my junior year at A&M
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.120]   where one of my roommates was studying with this girl.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.840]   And he and this girl had this weird kind of romantic tension
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.920]   going on in their friendship.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.480]   It was unspoken, but they just felt
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.680]   like they needed to finally talk it out.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.000]   So they went out into the parking lot of the apartment
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.280]   complex, and they began to talk about the romantic tension that
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.960]   was there.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.360]   And they just started taking laps around the parking lot.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.640]   And so the other four of us roommates,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.240]   we're like, he's our good friend.
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   We want to help him out.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.800]   And so we went to the second story,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.240]   and we opened up the windows, and we put stereo speakers
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.280]   into the windows.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.720]   And we started blasting the wedding march,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.680]   like, dun, dun, da, dun, dun, dun, dun,
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.400]   you know, like what they play at weddings.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.400]   Because we were like, this is probably where this is headed.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.280]   This is the beginning of something beautiful.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   Turns out he was getting the friend talk,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.560]   so we totally misread that situation.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.320]   It was not helpful, but he was blessed
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.840]   to have us in his life anyway.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.320]   But these were the guys that I met in college,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.240]   and they've become lifelong friends.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.520]   And they've seen me at my best moments and at my worst
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.040]   moments.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.680]   These were the guys that were there
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.440]   to pick up the pieces in my life at the age of 24
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.760]   when I hit rock bottom due to sin in my life.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.120]   These were the guys that stood next to me
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.720]   on the altar on my wedding day.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.520]   These were the guys that celebrated with Kat and I
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520]   when we got pregnant.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.300]   These were the people that I called
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.720]   when we had a miscarriage.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.640]   These are the people that I've called
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.600]   any time we have made a major decision in our lives.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.400]   These are the guys who have challenged me and encouraged me
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.800]   on countless long-distance phone calls,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.000]   and now Friday mornings for breakfast.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.880]   These are the guys who have pushed me for decades
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.120]   now to be a faithful follower of Jesus, a faithful husband,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.200]   a faithful dad, and a faithful friend.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   And so I just want to stand up here tonight,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.400]   and I want to make something very clear.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.600]   And here it is.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.760]   Intimacy is better than isolation.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.600]   Being loved is so much better than being lonely.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.880]   And I just want to be clear.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.640]   I am not talking about dating relationships right now.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.480]   I am not talking about getting married.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   I am talking about if you're a guy,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.440]   there is something so valuable to having other guys
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   in your life that you have intimate connection with,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.080]   like they know you, they know all of you,
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.840]   and they still love you.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.800]   If you're a girl, you have other girls
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.680]   with whom you can truly be fully known and fully loved.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.560]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.400]   When I talk about intimacy, I'm just talking about
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.560]   having people in your life who know everything about you,
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.160]   and yet they don't run from you.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   Everyone deserves that.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.280]   And some of y'all hear that, and you're lonely right now,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.480]   and you're like, yes, I want that.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.400]   And you're discouraged that you don't have that.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   And if that's you, I'm so glad you're here tonight,
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.580]   and I hope that tonight is helpful for you.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.840]   And yet the reality is that I believe
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.040]   that so many people in this room will just settle
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.740]   for living in isolation.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.840]   And you might hear that, and you're like,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.480]   I'm not isolated, like I'm around people all the time.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.240]   I'm in a room now with thousands of people,
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.860]   so you're not talking to me.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.960]   Well, let me just, I wanna make sure
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.480]   I'm not talking to you right now,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.860]   because I believe that it is possible
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.800]   to be surrounded by a lot of people.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   You can be surrounded by everybody, but known by nobody.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.000]   I think that that's possible.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.200]   Like, I'll illustrate it this way.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.080]   A while back, a good friend of mine,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.120]   he and his wife were watching the video
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.140]   of their wedding reception years ago.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.580]   They were watching it, and they saw me dancing
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.660]   on the dance floor at their wedding reception,
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.960]   and they felt like I needed to see it,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.680]   and they sent it to me.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.520]   And it was honestly haunting, it was horrifying,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.400]   especially when they posted it on Instagram.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.120]   And the reason it was so horrifying,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.640]   and this video is from a couple decades ago,
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.600]   is number one, I don't know what dance move I was doing.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.760]   Like, it was like this, it was like,
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.280]   I don't know if that's like screw in the light bulb
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.360]   type thing, like I don't know what I had going on,
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.320]   but I'm going around the dance floor like,
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.700]   that's what I was doing.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.000]   But that wasn't the worst part, this was the worst part.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The worst part is that I was surrounded
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.640]   by so many people, and yet I was dancing with no one.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.680]   It was so sad.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.960]   Like, you literally, you see me, and I'm there doing this,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.860]   and then you see other people, but everyone has their back
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.060]   to me like they're with other people,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.060]   but then there's Timothy Atik on the dance floor,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.380]   surrounded by everybody, but dancing with nobody.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.360]   And I wonder if that's your life.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.020]   I don't know.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.580]   Maybe.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.720]   You're like, no bro, that's just you.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.720]   But just think about it, is that you?
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.240]   Like, you're surrounded by people all the time,
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.480]   like you were surrounded by people at work all day today.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.440]   Surrounded by people now.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.760]   You're gonna go this weekend, you're gonna go for a run,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.280]   you're gonna go for a workout, you're gonna play volleyball,
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.240]   you're gonna be surrounded by people,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.740]   but no one actually knows you.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.320]   So just answer this question real quick,
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.120]   who in this world truly knows you?
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.240]   Who knows all of you?
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.760]   Like, they know your strengths,
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.040]   they celebrate your victories,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.760]   and yet they've seen behind the curtain of your life.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.020]   They know your sinful tendencies,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.600]   they're aware of your insecurities,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.640]   they know what triggers you.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.400]   Who actually knows you?
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.960]   Is there anyone in this world
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.520]   that you are truly fully known?
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.320]   And at the same exact time, you are fully loved?
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.360]   Because here's the reality,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.840]   if you're only partially known,
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.840]   then you're not fully loved.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.320]   Recently I was talking to a guy,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.780]   and I just sensed that there was something in his life
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.380]   that he was hiding, and so here's the question I asked him,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.920]   I said, hey, I just, I want to ask you this,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.440]   is there anything in your life
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.400]   that you have never told anyone else?
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.580]   And he said yes.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.040]   And he still hasn't shared it because of fear.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.020]   It's the fear of like, if I were to expose this,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.940]   if other people were to know this, they would run.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.280]   They would no longer love me, but here's the deal,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.880]   if you're only partially known,
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.760]   you will not be fully loved,
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.400]   because people can only love what you show them.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.000]   So people don't love you,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.120]   they actually love the manufactured version of you
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.600]   that you are projecting about yourself.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.200]   And that's a really miserable place to be
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.700]   because you never truly know that people actually love you,
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.120]   because you have this aspect of your life
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.860]   that you're hiding, so they don't love you,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.440]   they just love parts of you.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.120]   And so you're having to manage something.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.680]   And that's stressful, that's exhausting.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:16.240]   And so here's the deal, tonight I firmly believe
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.360]   that in the very beginning of the Bible,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.200]   what does it say in Genesis chapter two?
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.600]   God says it is not good for man to be alone.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.920]   And we often, we hear that verse
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.680]   and we think it's just referring to marriage.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.960]   Like we think that when we hear
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.480]   it's not good for man to be alone,
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.080]   that the only answer for that is marriage.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.360]   But I just want you to know
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.520]   that that verse doesn't just speak to marriage,
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.000]   that verse speaks to life.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.960]   Whether you're single, dating, or married,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.720]   every person in this room needs to know
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.280]   it is not good for you to be alone.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.540]   Every person in this room, everyone listening online,
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.120]   deserves to be fully known and fully loved.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.880]   God has actually wired you
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.320]   for deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.500]   Why?
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:05.200]   Because when you live life in deep, meaningful relationships
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.000]   that is when you are reflecting the character of God
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.320]   because God himself is a community.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.120]   He is three co-equal, co-eternal persons
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.320]   that exist in one essence.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.760]   He is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.600]   and yet there is only one God.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.840]   God himself is a perfect community.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.280]   At the core of God's character
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.400]   are deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.920]   And so one of the ways that we reflect God
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:41.240]   is by enjoying those types of relationships ourselves.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.920]   And so tonight as we step back
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.480]   into the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.580]   King Solomon, remember Solomon,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.400]   he's writing the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.720]   It's the last book that he wrote.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.400]   So it's just kind of this old dude
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.000]   who's walking back through his old journal entries.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.520]   And he's like, oh yeah, you're seeing what he values
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.280]   and what King Solomon is going to do
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.320]   is he's reflecting on his life
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.840]   and everything that he's learned
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.000]   as one of, if not the wisest person
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.400]   to ever walk the face of the earth next to Jesus Christ.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.640]   And what you're going to see King Solomon argue
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.000]   is that life is better together.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.680]   So if you have a Bible, join me tonight
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   in Ecclesiastes chapter four.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.080]   Ecclesiastes chapter four is where we're going to be.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.680]   We are looking tonight at verses four through 16,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.400]   but I'm going to teach them out of order.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.840]   What I'm first going to do
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.720]   is I'm going to jump straight to the climax of the passage,
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.760]   which is in verses nine through 12,
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.600]   where Solomon is just going to argue
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.800]   life is better together.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.400]   It's better to be loved than it is to be lonely.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.600]   Intimacy is better than isolation.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.200]   And then we're going to zoom out
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.720]   and the good thing about this passage
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.880]   is that Solomon is going to identify reasons
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.120]   why we will settle for less
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.920]   and why we will miss the joy
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.600]   of deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.960]   So look with me first at Ecclesiastes chapter four,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.080]   verses nine through 12.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.400]   This is what King Solomon says.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.840]   He says, "Two are better than one."
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.080]   There's his thesis, two are better than one.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.040]   Why?
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.400]   Because they have a good reward for their toil.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.220]   For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.280]   but woe to him who is alone when he falls
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.080]   and has not another to lift him up.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.560]   Again, if two lie together, they keep warm,
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.200]   but how can one keep warm alone?
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.640]   And though a man might prevail against one who is alone,
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   two will withstand him.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.340]   A threefold cord is not quickly broken.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.840]   So all eyes on me.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.000]   Don't miss what Solomon is really saying here.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.640]   His thesis is two are better than one.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.000]   And he gives different pictures to illustrate this.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.080]   He pictures two people on a journey together through life.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.200]   And he's like, "Look, you always accomplish more
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.260]   "when you work together."
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.500]   That's what he says in verse nine.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.340]   You're just gonna, you're gonna,
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.280]   you're going to be able to work more and produce more
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.640]   if you do it together.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.580]   And then in verse 10, he's like,
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.740]   "Man, if you're on a journey and you're walking on a path
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.920]   "and you fall into a pit, it is so helpful
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.040]   "to have someone else with you
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.460]   "who can pull you out of that pit.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.320]   "It's a bad day when you're by yourself,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.440]   "fall into a pit, no one's there to bail you out."
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.680]   Then in verse 11, he's like,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.420]   "You know what, if you're on a journey,
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.540]   "you're sleeping outside and it is freezing,
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.280]   "it's nice when there's someone else there
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.720]   "that you can kind of cuddle up next to,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.060]   "you can share body warmth.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.680]   "But it is a cold night when you're there by yourself."
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.640]   And then in verse 12, what does he say?
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.240]   He's basically like, "If you're on a journey
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.380]   "and you get jumped, it's so helpful
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.540]   "when someone has your back and can fight for you."
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.760]   And then he says, "A three-fold corridor
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.080]   "is not easily broken."
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.920]   You know what he's saying?
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.960]   He's saying, "You know what's better than two?
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.800]   "Three."
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.140]   So Solomon's point is two is better than one.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.840]   Intimacy is better than isolation.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   Being loved is better than being lonely.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.600]   So I just want you to think about this.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.400]   If you were to take verses nine through 12
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.760]   and you were to apply them to the Christian life,
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.920]   imagine what is possible for you.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.880]   Imagine what God wants for you.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.980]   Just think about it.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.920]   Look again at verse nine, just look at the wording.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.560]   He says, "Two are better than one
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.840]   "because they have a good reward for their toil."
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.500]   If you were to apply this to following Jesus,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.240]   then if Solomon is right, you will be a more healthy,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.600]   more mature, and more fruitful follower of Jesus Christ
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   if you actively follow Jesus with other followers.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.400]   Like you run through life together.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.340]   It's just gonna go better for you.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.520]   Right now, my son and I,
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.760]   we are watching the Tour de France together.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.640]   We watched this documentary about the Tour de France,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.360]   which is a 21-day, over 2,000-mile bike race.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.000]   We watched it on Netflix, and it was so fascinating
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.720]   that it caused us to want to actually
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.640]   watch the Tour de France each day.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.100]   Like, who knew that bike racing could be so exciting?
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.200]   Some of y'all watched that documentary,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.400]   and you know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.840]   And the majority of you are like,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.900]   "Bro, I don't get it yet."
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.040]   But anyway, you will at some point.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.160]   But the amazing thing about the Tour de France
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.040]   is it is a team sport.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.660]   You cannot, it is not possible for you to win
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.960]   the Tour de France on your own.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.900]   Like, you're on a team.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.440]   There's eight people on a team.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   And what's amazing is that every team chooses one leader,
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.840]   and then the other seven riders all ride
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.160]   to help that one person win.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.340]   It's crazy.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.300]   So seven people will ride over 2,000 miles
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.180]   to help someone else win.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.560]   And so at any given point in the race,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.280]   this one leader will have three to four different teammates
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.840]   surrounding him to protect him,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.440]   or to ride in front of him to block the wind
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.240]   so it is 40% easier for him to pedal.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.680]   Certain teammates will pull the leader along
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.920]   and use all of their strength.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.800]   And once they've used up all their strength,
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.440]   they'll just peel off
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.440]   so that the leader is launched to keep going.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.800]   And I'm like, man, what a beautiful picture
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.880]   of the Christian life.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.120]   But the difference between the Tour de France
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.200]   and the Christian life is that there isn't only one winner.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.840]   Like, everyone can win.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.560]   What if we begin to ride for each other to win?
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.200]   Like, what if we were committed to seeing each other
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.080]   flourish in our relationships with Jesus?
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.960]   We need it.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.680]   Anyone wanna be honest and just say,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.880]   man, I feel disconnected from God right now?
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.260]   Anyone?
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.100]   No one.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.520]   Awesome, way to go, guys.
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.560]   Like, I think if we were honest, yes, thank you.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.260]   We've got people waving their hands.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.880]   Like, yes, if we were honest,
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   many people feel disconnected from God.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.560]   I wonder if anyone is dealing with doubts
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.480]   about God right now.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.800]   Anyone dealing with doubts towards God?
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.240]   Yes.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.120]   Anyone just feeling dry in their relationship with God?
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.360]   Yes, of course people are.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.840]   My question for you, if you feel that way,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.980]   is who is racing with you?
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.640]   Who's on your team pulling you along,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.780]   encouraging you along the way?
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.460]   Solomon says in verse nine,
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.300]   he says two are better than one
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.860]   because they have a good reward for their toil.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.860]   So just imagine, if you wanna see movement in your life,
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.480]   let me just encourage you to do this.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.860]   Find at least one other person,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.600]   get on the same Bible reading plan together.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.980]   Like, you can do Join the Journey,
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.060]   which is Watermark's Bible reading plan.
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.740]   Just go to jointhejourney.com, you can get the app.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.700]   There's other Bible reading apps
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.900]   where both of y'all can be linked up,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.400]   you can read the same thing,
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.860]   you can share your notes with each other, do that.
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.820]   Share prayer requests with each other every day.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.280]   Try this for seven days, every day for one week,
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.420]   text one God story to another person.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.580]   A God story is just simply one way
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.140]   that you saw God show up in your life that day.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.340]   If you're driving, just send a voice memo real quick
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.640]   of what God taught you that day.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.920]   Go out on a Saturday and just try and share the gospel
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.800]   with other people, but do it together.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.080]   I promise you, you are going to get traction,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.680]   you're gonna get momentum.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.660]   Memorize a verse together.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.120]   You can get the Scripture Typer app.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.880]   And when I talk about memorizing Scripture,
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.560]   I'm just talking about literally finding a verse
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.300]   that is really meaningful to you
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.960]   and committing it to memory,
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.120]   because when you memorize it,
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.460]   you're more likely to recall it and be encouraged by it.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.720]   Proverbs 27, 17 says, "Iron sharpens iron,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.120]   "so one man sharpens another."
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.960]   But Solomon goes on in verse 10, and what does he say?
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.420]   He says, "For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow,
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.280]   "but woe to him who is alone when he falls
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.540]   "and has not another to lift him up."
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.600]   So this is about, hey, how do you bounce back
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.580]   from falling royally into sin?
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.460]   Like, how do you bounce back from cheating
[00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.380]   on your boyfriend or girlfriend?
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.000]   How do you bounce back from those compromising decisions
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.160]   that caused you to get fired?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.500]   Like, how do you bounce back from a season
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.600]   of just a bunch of random hookups
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.620]   or a long season of just getting wasted
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.460]   on each night of the weekend?
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.200]   Or what about this?
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.240]   How do you bounce back from having an abortion
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.140]   that is just causing a lot of shame in your life right now?
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.260]   Like, how do we bounce back from moments like that?
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.820]   What Solomon is saying is, hey, there's going to be times
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.900]   when we fall into sin, and we need to make sure
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.500]   that we have the right people in our lives
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.020]   to help lift us up, because here's the reality.
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.020]   God uses his people to lift up his people.
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.780]   God uses his people to lift up his people.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.580]   I can just speak from my own experience.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.580]   When I was 24 years old, I was in just an extended season
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.180]   of compromising decisions, and it resulted, really,
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.380]   in my life hitting rock bottom.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.180]   I was living a hypocritical life.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.420]   At the time, I was going to seminary,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.980]   and I was actually working as an intern here at Watermark.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.620]   I was working with high school students,
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.940]   and I was encouraging high school guys
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.940]   to be men of character and integrity and purity,
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.040]   but I wasn't doing that in my own life.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.140]   And so what happened was I had to step out
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.260]   of my position of leadership at Watermark
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.260]   because I simply was not qualified anymore.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.980]   My life, what I said to be true in the way I was living,
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.340]   it just didn't, it didn't match.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.740]   And my compromising decisions just led to a season
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.380]   of brokenness and shame.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.340]   And what did God do?
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.460]   He put the right people in my life to lift me up.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.860]   Like, I had a few guys who were just so committed
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.660]   to my health, that they were with me,
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.180]   they were encouraging me.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.420]   I was able to confess to them and share openly with them.
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.380]   Like, I was in seminary at the time.
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.380]   I didn't have a job making a bunch of money,
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:36.740]   so they just said, "Hey, you can come live with us.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.400]   "Pay us $200 a month.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.600]   "You can live with us.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.860]   "We're gonna care for you.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.000]   "We're gonna encourage you
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.660]   "and challenge you along the way."
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.500]   And then when I started dating my wife, Catherine,
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.260]   these guys pressed in on me.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.860]   They asked me the right questions,
[00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.540]   just to ensure that I made decisions that led to joy
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.620]   instead of brokenness and shame.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.860]   Like, what I have realized in my life,
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.540]   because I have been the guy in the pit
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.380]   that Solomon's talking about in verse 10,
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.020]   and at the same time, I've experienced the friendships
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.520]   of people who can come and lift you out of the pit,
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.780]   what I've realized is that, hey, the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.980]   the good news is of Jesus Christ,
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.860]   it's sufficient for everyone in this room.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.220]   Jesus went to the cross.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.000]   If you don't know the significance
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.540]   of Jesus Christ dying on the cross, why did he die?
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:36.540]   He died to set us free from sin that enslaves us.
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.020]   He went to the cross and he endured punishment
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.620]   that was rightfully ours.
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.420]   No one is naturally right with God.
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.780]   All of us have sin in our lives that separates us from God,
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.820]   and yet Jesus Christ dealt with all of our sins.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.620]   He made payment for our sins.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.900]   When he rose from the dead, it was a demonstration
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.300]   that he had conquered all of our failures.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.840]   And when we put our trust in Jesus Christ,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.500]   when we invite him into our lives to be our savior,
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.280]   to be our king, his forgiveness is sufficient
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.180]   for every single person in this room.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.240]   He wipes you clean, he makes you new.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:25.860]   And yet it's possible for you to be forgiven by God,
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.400]   and yet you stay down.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.400]   Like when you fall, sometimes you don't feel worthy
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.200]   to get back up, and so you just stay down.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.380]   And so what we have to understand is that God uses
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.200]   his people to lift up his people.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.600]   And you might be saying, "God could never love me."
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.440]   I know he loves you.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.640]   Do you know how I know that he can love you?
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.000]   Because he's loved me.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.220]   He's loved me through all of my failures
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.500]   and all of my brokenness, so there is nothing
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.600]   you could come down here and tell me that would shock me
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   or make me rethink the idea that God is sufficient
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.440]   for your deepest failures.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.700]   And yet you might be someone that you need people
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.020]   in your life who can lift you up.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.300]   And so I'll just say this.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.660]   Do you have the right people in your life
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.540]   that if you've fallen can lift you up?
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.300]   Do you have people that you can go to tonight
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.800]   and just say, "Look, I've failed, will you help me?"
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.580]   If you've had an abortion, like we have a ministry here
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.740]   worth more, it exists to help lift you up.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.680]   You don't have to stay in that shame.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.260]   Solomon goes on in verse 11, what does he say?
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.300]   He says, "Again, if two lie together, they keep warm,
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.320]   "but how can one keep warm alone?"
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.260]   Here's the reality, life can be bitter cold sometimes.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.920]   Bad things happen, bad things happen.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   Getting fired happens, breakups happen,
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.260]   rejection happens, parent divorce happens,
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.260]   depression happens, chronic pain happens, cancer happens.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.280]   And you know what our tendency is when life gets cold?
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.960]   Our tendency is to withdraw and shiver alone.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:24.440]   And yet God loves us enough that he has wired us
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.880]   for deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.960]   You deserve to be known, you deserve to be loved
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.480]   in the coldest seasons of life.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.520]   Can you imagine having people in your life
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.700]   that are so committed to you when life is cold
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.640]   that they are there day after day to make sure
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.260]   that you get out of bed and you shower and you go to work.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:48.260]   They're there to remind you to actually eat.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.680]   They're there to listen and process with you.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.200]   They're there to help you sift through what is a lie
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.560]   and what is truth.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.920]   They're there to comfort you and encourage you.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.100]   They're there to go with you to professional counseling
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.400]   if that's what is needed.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.200]   They are there at the funeral with you.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.460]   They're there to make sure that you don't do stupid things
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.940]   because sometimes when we are hurting most,
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.440]   we sin the most.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.760]   And so they're there to encourage you along the way.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.160]   Two are better than one because when life gets cold,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   you don't have to shiver alone.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.800]   And then Solomon says in verse 12, he says,
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.240]   "And though a man might prevail against one who is alone,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.360]   "two will withstand him.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.380]   "A threefold cord is not quickly broken."
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.760]   It's just a reminder that every person in this room
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.880]   has an enemy.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.600]   I'm not talking about some other human being.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.220]   I'm talking about Satan himself.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.640]   All of us have an enemy that hates us.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.100]   We all have an enemy that wants to destroy,
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.260]   ruin our relationship with God
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.940]   and cause us deep pain in this life.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.960]   And so the question is, do you have a few people
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.920]   in your life who are like a small army
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.940]   that will fight for you?
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.180]   Now let me be clear.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.960]   Jesus has already won the victory.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.620]   He has already conquered Satan, sin and death
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.360]   through his death on the cross
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.560]   and through his resurrection from the dead.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.100]   He is the one that has been victorious for us.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:19.000]   So there's not some cosmic battle between God and Satan
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.320]   where we bite our nails like who's gonna win?
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.200]   It's already been won.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.960]   Satan's just a really sore loser
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.600]   who fouls the rest of the time until the clock reads zero.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.300]   And so God doesn't need us to be strong
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.180]   and do things in our own strength.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.980]   And yet often God displays his power in our lives
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:43.260]   through his people.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.420]   Did you hear what I just said?
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:48.860]   Often God displays his power in our lives
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.500]   through his people.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.800]   Do you have the right people to fight for you in your life?
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.220]   A while back I watched two different YouTube videos
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:30:59.380]   on the same day.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.380]   I realize that doesn't sound impressive to you at all.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.020]   But the reason that I share that
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.860]   is that these two YouTube videos
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.220]   could not have been more different in their outcomes.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.220]   The first video I watched was a video from a documentary
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.860]   from a long time ago called Planet Earth,
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.460]   which was just basically like this documentary
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.860]   about Planet Earth
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.580]   and all these magnificent shots of nature.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.060]   Well, on this one particular video I watched,
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.220]   there was this herd of caribou on an open plain,
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:39.020]   and there were hundreds of caribou on this open plain.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.020]   And then there was a few wolves
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.000]   that were looking for their next meal.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.780]   And so you see this hundreds of caribou
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.500]   and maybe just a handful of wolves
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.420]   that kind of fan out and spread out
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.980]   looking for their next meal.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.320]   And what happens is that one of the wolves,
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.380]   isolates a baby caribou.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:06.300]   And so Planet Earth, you have this aerial drone footage
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.380]   where you see this baby caribou
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.220]   get further and further away from the herd.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.900]   And at the same time that he is getting further
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.060]   and further away from the herd,
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.500]   you see the wolf getting closer and closer to the caribou.
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.740]   And eventually the wolf overtakes the caribou
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.060]   and it's game over for the caribou.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.820]   That was the first video I watched.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.660]   The second video that I watched had a much different outcome
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   and in case you weren't one of the 90 million people
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.220]   that watched this video, I'm just gonna explain it to you,
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.060]   but you should go and watch the Battle of Kruger,
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.220]   which is eight minutes of glory.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.980]   It's this video about water buffalo and lions.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.020]   Like I don't know if you know this,
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.500]   but there's some serious stuff going on
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.220]   between water buffalo and lions.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.220]   Like the animal kingdom, those two, they do not get along.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:01.500]   And so in this one particular video,
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   this herd of water buffalo come upon a pride of lions.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.780]   And the pride of lions runs after the water buffalo
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.820]   and they chase the water buffalo off.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.980]   And what you see is you see this one lion
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:21.060]   tackle a baby water buffalo calf.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.540]   He tackles him and drags him into the water.
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.060]   And you think it's game over
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.100]   for this little baby water buffalo,
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.460]   because there's somebody, some random person on a safari
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.780]   is just filming this.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.460]   And all you're watching for a little bit of time
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.220]   is that this lion is just sitting there
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.780]   kind of going after this calf.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.260]   And you're like, at some point
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.620]   you just turn the camera off, you know,
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.200]   but they just kept it rolling.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.620]   And I'm so glad they did, because at one point
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.060]   it zooms out and what you see
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.820]   is you see the whole herd of water buffalo
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.980]   like shuffling together.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.580]   They're like, look, we're all going together.
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:59.680]   There's safety in numbers.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.140]   It's like women going to the bathroom.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.100]   They're like, we're all going, we're all gonna do this.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.620]   And so they all shuffled together.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.620]   Meanwhile, this lion is just so fixated on his next meal.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.660]   And then it zooms out and what you see
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.460]   is this herd of water buffalo
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.280]   has just surrounded this one lion.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.800]   And then one of the water buffalo jacks the lion
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.660]   to where he somersaults through the air
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.340]   and that baby calf gets up and runs off and he's fine.
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.300]   And it just brought new meaning to 1 Peter 5, 8,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.220]   which says, "Be sober-minded, be watchful.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.060]   "Your adversary, the devil, prowls around
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:42.720]   "like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour."
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.460]   My question for you is, do you have a few water buffalo
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.220]   in your life that have your back?
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.300]   'Cause if not, you need to get some.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:59.780]   If no one knows the extent of your porn struggle,
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.380]   if no one knows that you're starving yourself,
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.120]   if no one knows that you're cutting yourself,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.580]   or if the only people around you are cheering you on
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.780]   as you party, as you hook up with people,
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.460]   as you lead people on, then you need to know
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.800]   you are a calf isolated from the herd.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.760]   And there is a lion that is prowling around
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.980]   seeking to devour you.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:28.760]   And I assure you, I beg and plead with you to hear me now.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.800]   You're on a path that will only end in brokenness.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.300]   And we will always be here at the porch.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.800]   We will be here to help you put the pieces back together
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.820]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.380]   But I just wanna plead with you right now, wake up.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.460]   Wake up, you're on a path to brokenness.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.580]   You need a few men or a few women with whom
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.420]   you are fully known and fully loved.
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.660]   They know your sinful tendencies.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.540]   They know your insecurities.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.380]   And yet they don't run from you.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.980]   Like, that's what you deserve.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.260]   You deserve for someone to hear everything about you
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.300]   and to not flinch.
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.140]   That's what I deserve.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.180]   I deserve to be able to share every aspect of my life,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.820]   the darkest thoughts, the darkest actions,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.140]   the darkest motivations of my heart,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.860]   and for someone to not flinch.
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.420]   Why?
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.420]   Because they themselves have their own sin.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.940]   We both are just desperately in need of the grace of God.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:37.100]   Both of us have brokenness that we can share
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.660]   with one another and both rejoice that Jesus Christ
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:43.260]   has come and he has made us new.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.740]   He has washed us clean.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.900]   He has freed us from our past.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.780]   And he loves us.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.420]   And so let me say this, I still remember just sharing
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.580]   with some college students to go and to be vulnerable
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.460]   and to share, and I remember this one student came
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.620]   and found me later and she was angry with me
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.420]   and she just said, "I did what you told me to do.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.540]   "I went and shared."
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.940]   And it caused deep hurt.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:14.380]   Here's the reality, some of you guys don't realize that,
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.460]   but you're acting like you need God's grace less
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.060]   because people have been vulnerable,
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.660]   they've shared their darkness with you
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.500]   and you know what you've done?
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.860]   You've shamed them.
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.020]   Or you have mismanaged what they shared with you.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:33.420]   And you need to confess that to the Lord
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.500]   and you need to seek forgiveness.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.180]   We're imperfect people and we all need each other
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.780]   and we all need the grace of God, every single one of us.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:50.180]   And so let me just say this, God has wired us
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.580]   for deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.700]   He has.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.980]   Do you have people who can run alongside you?
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.500]   Do you have people who can lift you up when you've fallen?
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.100]   Do you have people who can keep you warm
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.540]   during the cold seasons of life?
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.540]   Do you have people who will go to war for you?
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.060]   You deserve that.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.900]   If you don't have it, you're missing out.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.500]   And so that's the climax of the passage.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.820]   Two are better than one.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.580]   Now let's just zoom out very quickly
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.620]   because what Solomon does is he tells us why
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:25.860]   many of us will settle for something less
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.780]   than what we deserve.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.580]   Just look quickly with me, verse four.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.460]   Look at what it says.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.380]   Solomon says, "Then I saw that all toil
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.780]   "and all skill and work come from a man's envy
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.660]   "of his neighbor.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.260]   "This also is vanity and a striving after win."
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.620]   That word envy there, when he talks about envy of a neighbor
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.620]   it points to competition and rivalry.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.020]   You wanna know why you don't have close friends?
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.980]   It's because you don't have friends, you have frenemies
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.280]   due to competition.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.280]   One pastor talked about each of our need
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.000]   for what he called the err factor.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.440]   Like something that's in us needs to be able
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.000]   to look around at the people around us
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.080]   and we need to know that we are smart-er,
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.000]   funny-er, pretty-er,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.440]   skinny-er,
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.920]   talented-er,
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.760]   successful-er.
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.200]   We just need to know that.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:37.320]   And it causes competition and competition kills closeness.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.920]   Just think, some of y'all subtly resent the fact
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   that one of your friends gets more attention
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.440]   from guys or girls than you.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:52.840]   Or you're single and you feel this interesting relief
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.180]   when your roommate's relationship ends.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.340]   [audience laughing]
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.540]   Right?
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:09.100]   Or like some guys, like you feel relief
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:13.540]   when that girl tells that guy no when he asks her out.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.880]   It's like, well if I gotta know, he should too.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.660]   Or like you've got that roommate
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.300]   that never has to think twice before booking the next trip
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.580]   just because he's got the money
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.380]   and something in you hates that,
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.580]   that you're having to watch every single penny
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.340]   that you spend.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.840]   It's competition.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.500]   Competition kills closeness.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.420]   I still remember years ago,
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.020]   I was at the gym running on the treadmill.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.760]   I share that just so you think that I work out.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.740]   [audience laughing]
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.140]   So that one time I was running on a treadmill
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.940]   and it really felt like God just slapped me
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:53.880]   on the side of the head.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.700]   He didn't speak audibly,
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.420]   but I will never forget where I was at that gym
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.180]   on that treadmill when God said this to me.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.820]   He said, "You need everyone around you to be a nobody
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.320]   "so that you can feel like somebody."
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.980]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.500]   You need everyone around you to be a nobody
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.260]   so that you can feel like a somebody.
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.380]   What he's saying is you need everyone to fail
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.440]   so that you can feel like a success.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.700]   That's competition.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:26.280]   It's hard to get close to people
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.700]   when you want them to fail
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.360]   or when you celebrate their failures.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.020]   So there's competition.
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.360]   Verse five, here's another reason why many of us
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.500]   will miss out on deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.480]   Verse five, he says, "The fool folds his hands
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.720]   "and eats his own flesh."
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.520]   That's a weird statement.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.240]   But he says the fool folds his hands.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.020]   When do you fold your hands?
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.800]   It's when you're lounging on the couch.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.720]   It's when you're relaxing.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.920]   He's painting the picture of a lazy fool
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.360]   who does nothing and because he does nothing,
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.020]   he has nothing, so he starts eating his own flesh.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:06.240]   He has no motivation, he has no drive, he has no job,
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.920]   he has no money, and he has no friends.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.040]   He has no activity.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.280]   He never gets out.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.640]   Do you know that person?
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.140]   Maybe you are that person.
[00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.960]   Like this was a big step for you
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.680]   just even to be here tonight.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.200]   Like someone had to drag you here
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.100]   because you already had plans to do nothing.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.560]   But do you know what it's like?
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.440]   There's no drive, there's no discipline.
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.400]   There's no initiation with other people.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.920]   See, what you have to remember is deep relationships
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:43.900]   require selflessness, thoughtfulness, care,
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.080]   respect, patience, and initiative.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.340]   Laziness and apathy, they're the enemy of intentionality.
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.780]   And maybe you have friendships, just analyze.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:00.580]   Are you only talking without ever asking?
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:06.920]   Are you attending and never planning?
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.700]   Are you only receiving and never giving?
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:17.020]   If so, that might be straining your relationships.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:21.020]   Verses seven and eight, stick with me
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.060]   just a little bit longer.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.780]   Just another reason why many of us
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:24.940]   will settle for something less.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.880]   Verse seven again, he says, this is a huge one.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.720]   I hope you don't miss it.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.760]   He says, "Again, I saw vanity under the sun.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.420]   "One person who has no other, either son or brother.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.320]   "Yet there's no end to all his toil,
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.000]   "and his eyes are never satisfied with riches
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.920]   "so that he never asks, for whom am I toiling
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.420]   "and depriving myself of pleasure?
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:48.540]   "This also is vanity in an unhappy business.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.500]   "Here is a picture of a guy that values profit
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.340]   "and possessions over people."
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:58.060]   So what you see is a person with a relentless ambition
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.980]   to work and to obtain wealth, and because of that,
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.420]   there's never any time for relationships.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.820]   Solomon's like, look, he makes all this wealth,
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.140]   and yet he has no one to share it with.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.460]   So on one end of the spectrum, you have laziness
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.740]   and apathy, on the other end, you know what you have
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.060]   is you have a professional ladder climber.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.260]   You're like, what does that mean?
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.260]   I mean, you're always climbing some ladder.
[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.980]   It's like, when I make $100,000 a year,
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.180]   so you're gonna climb that ladder.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.460]   You know what the problem is?
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.940]   At the top of that ladder is the bottom of another ladder.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.700]   You're gonna start making 100K a year,
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.420]   then it's like, you know what?
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.620]   I wanna be executive vice president,
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.820]   so you're gonna climb that ladder.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.060]   The problem is at the top of that ladder
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.460]   is just the bottom of another ladder.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.700]   At some point, you're gonna die on a ladder,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.660]   and you're gonna make tons of money,
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.420]   but you've spent all of your time
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.980]   prioritizing profit and possessions
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.540]   at the expense of people.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.740]   I remember these friends who had graduated college
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:59.140]   and moved to New York to go into investment banking.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.540]   They were working 100 hours a week
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.060]   and making tons of money, but they never got to enjoy it
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.420]   because they were always at the office working.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:12.380]   And so let me just beg you, you know what?
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.980]   Be ambitious, be successful,
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:19.980]   but do not sacrifice people for the sake of profit.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.620]   And then finally, verses 13 through 16,
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.140]   it's this weird little story at the end.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.020]   I'm just gonna show you one detail about it.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.780]   Solomon says, "Better was a poor and wise youth
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.420]   "than an old and foolish king
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.520]   "who no longer knew how to take advice,
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.800]   "for he went from prison to the throne.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.520]   "Though in his own kingdom he had been born poor,
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:43.200]   "I saw all the living who move about under the sun
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.540]   "along with that youth
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.300]   "who was to stand in the king's place.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.360]   "There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led,
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.780]   "yet those who come later will not rejoice in him.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.800]   "Surely this also is vanity and striving after win."
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.600]   I'm not gonna unpack this story for you.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.880]   The only thing I want you to see
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.400]   is that there's a king in the story
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.220]   who could not take advice.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.520]   You wanna know what will keep you
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.120]   from deep, meaningful relationships?
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:11.400]   Your inability to receive counsel and advice
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.460]   from other people.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.200]   It's really hard to be friends
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.020]   with someone who is never wrong.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:22.600]   It is, it's hard to be close with someone
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.920]   who is always right and never wrong.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.720]   Proverbs 27, six says,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.640]   "That the wounds of a friend can be trusted,
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.560]   "but an enemy multiplies kisses."
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.320]   That's such an interesting proverb
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.360]   because it's saying you need people in your life
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.720]   who are not afraid to punch you in the face with the truth.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.200]   They love you enough to tell you what you need to hear,
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   not what you want to hear.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.400]   You know who an enemy is?
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.480]   An enemy is someone who would just kiss you on the cheek
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.720]   and say, "Just keep doing what you're doing."
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.880]   And yet many of us will miss out on intimacy
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.440]   simply because of pride thinking that we know best.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.560]   Competition, laziness, an insatiable drive for success,
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.600]   and an inability to receive advice
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.920]   will absolutely keep you
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.420]   from deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:16.880]   From the beginning, God has been clear,
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.360]   it is not good for me to be alone.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.200]   It's not good.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:25.920]   You have been wired for deep, meaningful relationships.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.200]   So let me just encourage you, take a step tonight.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   Like don't just take this talk process and say,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.040]   "You know what?
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.360]   "Yeah, I need to get more friends someday."
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.240]   No, I want to encourage you, take a step tonight.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:41.600]   Like maybe you need to grab one of your friends here
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.020]   and you just need to sit in this place.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.280]   Or maybe y'all need to go together to the prayer chapel
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.440]   where there's going to be worship and prayer happening
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.720]   and y'all just need to get together
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.200]   and you just need to say, "I need to be honest with you.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.380]   "I need to be fully known by you.
[00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.200]   "I'm going to show you everything in my life
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.600]   "and I'm going to trust that you're not going to run.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.420]   "You're still going to love me through it."
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.700]   Or maybe you just need to take a small step.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.080]   Maybe you just moved to town and you don't know anyone.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.920]   Or maybe you've been in Dallas for two years
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.280]   and you still don't know someone.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.560]   This Friday night, chicken and pickle,
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.500]   7 p.m., we're playing pickleball.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.080]   And that might feel so lighthearted,
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.960]   but maybe the reason you're going to pick up a paddle
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.120]   this Friday is because you're going to meet somebody
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.160]   that you're going to begin to journey through life with.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.660]   And you're going to experience intimacy with them.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:35.440]   Or maybe you need to go out and go to the table out there.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.560]   You're going to see a big banner
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.820]   and you need to sign up for our Labor Day weekend
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:40.040]   launch retreat.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   Like if you haven't found your people,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:45.000]   hey, we're giving you an opportunity.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.320]   Hundreds of young adults are all going to be together
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.200]   for a weekend.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.160]   Come find your people.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.200]   Stop making excuses about why you're not going to come.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.160]   Like the whole point of the weekend
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:02.480]   is not just a shot of adrenaline, it's relationship.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.380]   It's for you to find your people
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.440]   so you can be known and loved.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:09.200]   Or maybe your way of connecting with people
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.360]   is just through serving.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.320]   Like you can go up, outside now, you can go up to the loft
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.380]   and you can just hear about how you can serve
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.600]   behind the scenes at lunch.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.720]   Maybe that's a way to just shrink lunch down
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.920]   to a size that just is going to feel good
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.440]   where you can serve behind the scenes
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.560]   and just have meaningful conversations
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.940]   with the people that you serve alongside with.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:35.040]   Maybe you need to take a step with membership
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.640]   here at Watermark or you want to jump into a community group
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.800]   you can go to stage two, up the stairs and through the doors
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.680]   you can talk to our Next Steps team
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.980]   to figure out how to take a step into community.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.720]   And then some of you are here tonight
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.420]   and you need to go seek forgiveness
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.060]   from someone who shared with you
[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.840]   and you didn't manage their information well.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.760]   You know what, allow the grace of God
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:01.000]   to do a magnificent work in your life through that.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.960]   If you need to talk to someone or pray with someone,
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.920]   we'll have a team of people down front.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.560]   But I just want to close by pointing you
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:10.640]   to the most important relationship that you could ever have.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.000]   It's a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.260]   Jesus Christ is the one who lifts us out of the pit
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.460]   of our sin and he does it by saving us from our sin
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.800]   through his sufficient death on the cross
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.280]   and resurrection from the dead.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.060]   Jesus Christ is the one who can keep us warm
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.680]   in the midst of a broken world
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.000]   who through his conquest on the cross,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.980]   he has ensured that a day is coming
[00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.320]   where he's gonna make all things new
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.800]   and we will spend eternity with him,
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.080]   enjoying his presence, enjoying wholeness.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.840]   Jesus Christ is the one who went to war with our enemy
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:48.360]   and he conquered Satan's sin and death.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.200]   Why?
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.460]   Because he could be free and we could have life in him.
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.260]   And so let me be clear, if you're here tonight
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.900]   and you don't have a real relationship with Jesus Christ,
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.440]   your next step tonight is a step of surrender.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:04.940]   It's being fully known and fully loved
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.700]   by the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.300]   We're so glad that you're here tonight.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.020]   My hope and prayer is that you'd be a people
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:13.860]   that take a step.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.060]   So here's how we're gonna close tonight.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.220]   I'm gonna turn it over to the band
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.620]   and we're just gonna worship.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:26.580]   So you need to know from this point on, you're free to go.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.580]   Like if you've got somewhere else to be, you can go.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.420]   But if you're gonna go,
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.700]   I'm just gonna ask you to leave quietly
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.340]   because we're gonna respond in worship.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.980]   We're just gonna spend a little time worshiping.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.820]   You're free to go, but you're also free to stay.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.660]   And let's meet with God.
[00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:42.460]   Let's meet with one another
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:46.060]   and let's respond to what God is doing in our lives.
