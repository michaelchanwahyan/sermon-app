[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.100]   Man, it's good to be with you guys.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220]   I was in the back in the green room,
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.620]   and Jason and Jackie and the band are piped in there,
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.140]   so I can only hear them.
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.580]   And it was interesting, because I came out this door right
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.060]   back here just a few minutes ago as we were singing that last
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.740]   song, "It's Who You Are."
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.820]   And all I could hear was you guys, and it was incredible.
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.100]   I wish you could have heard it.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.900]   And just this tremendous choir made up
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.020]   of thousands of young adults praising the creator
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.220]   of the heavens and the earth.
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.220]   Man, I know life's crazy.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940]   And I'm so proud of you just for being here.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.700]   I'm so proud of you for wanting to know God more.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.460]   I know there's so many distractions in Dallas
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.780]   and Fort Worth and all over our cities.
[00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.940]   And just that you're here, I got here just a few moments ago
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.940]   and got the last spot.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.620]   I waited in traffic, first of all, like many of you.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.660]   And I was like, oh, no.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.340]   This is not good.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.980]   I didn't think about traffic.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.820]   And then got the last spot in this parking lot over here.
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940]   And it was just a humbling thing to walk in here
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.740]   and to watch a movement of God and to see a perspective
[00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.300]   that I don't have every week.
[00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.340]   And so thank you guys.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.140]   I'm so proud of you for just the way that you give of yourself.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.340]   And you're open to knowing God more.
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.500]   I'll start here with a question, where we're headed.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.540]   Some are on the Mount in this series.
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.740]   What do people do when they see an explosion?
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.940]   I heard run, run.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.580]   Yeah, like when you've seen this,
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.940]   you're probably like, well, I've never seen an explosion.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.140]   It was that Kaboom Town thing.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.700]   But no, whenever we see something blow up,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.200]   or whenever you're watching a movie and they see something
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.540]   blow up, you kind of see everybody turns and runs.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.360]   And then they're knocked over by the force.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.740]   Or somebody yells, bomb.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.900]   And everybody takes off.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.400]   We see this.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.500]   Any time there's an explosion, everybody
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.340]   runs away from that explosion.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.940]   Which is why a year ago, a dear friend of mine, Cheryl Boyd,
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300]   a dear partner in ministry, showed me this video
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   that I found curious.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300]   And I actually showed it to you about a year ago.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.340]   We're committed to teaching the topic
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.100]   that we're going to cover tonight at least every year.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.100]   Because I think it's one of the single greatest
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.300]   needs in the room.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.940]   And Jesus is covering it as he moves
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.260]   through the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.180]   And so when people see an explosion,
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.600]   they run from that explosion.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.300]   But when my friend showed me this video,
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.180]   I saw something curious.
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.600]   And I want you to watch this video.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.220]   But I want you to pay close attention to the last thing
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.980]   the man says.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.180]   When he comes back up and they're interviewing him,
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.140]   I want you to listen closely to what he says.
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.540]   Watch this.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.180]   Take a look at this dramatic scene caught on video
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.780]   released surveillance tape.
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.100]   A driver pumping gas in Harrison, New York last week.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.460]   And then this.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.420]   Out of nowhere, a car flies in, crashing into the pump,
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.100]   and immediately starting a massive fire.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.540]   The man at the pump, New York State Police Senior
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.060]   Investigator John Vesio, escaping the scene just
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.340]   in the nick of time.
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.900]   The impact was very sudden.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.820]   It was very quick.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.860]   Take a look again.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.540]   Within two seconds, the car hits, the pump falls,
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.180]   and the fire erupts.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.460]   I actually went to look up and see what was going on.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.540]   And next thing I knew, the pump was coming down on top of me.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.940]   Now watch as more drama unfolds.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.340]   Vesio, who'd at first darted away,
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.380]   runs back after spotting the 70-year-old driver who'd
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.620]   crashed the car after suffering a diabetic shock
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.660]   and now could not move.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.860]   He was not responsive.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.780]   I found when I got to the car, he was pretty much helpless.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.300]   Vesio struggles to get him out of the car,
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.740]   finally dragging him out by his shirt,
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.700]   only to return to the fiery scene
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.100]   to get a first aid kit from his car.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.780]   And there wasn't a moment to spare.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.420]   Take a look.
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.380]   Seconds later, a ball of fire consumes the car,
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.740]   both men miraculously out of the danger zone.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.820]   I think John did a very heroic thing.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.820]   I think he starts off as a civilian.
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.500]   He becomes a victim.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.260]   And then his police training kicks in,
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.020]   and he actually saved somebody's life.
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.740]   He said he became a victim, and then his training kicked in.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.940]   And one thing that it said that I disagree with
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.860]   is said both men miraculously free from the danger.
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.100]   It wasn't miraculously.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.780]   It was due to one guy being trained in a situation
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.020]   to run toward an explosion and drag
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.260]   those who are going to be hurt by that explosion
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.500]   out of the situation.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.140]   And so tonight, the topic that Jesus is going to cover
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.260]   is anger.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.500]   And I'm equating anger with explosions
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.900]   because let me tell you something.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.260]   Much of my life has been marked by this topic of anger
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.220]   in explosive ways.
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.900]   And I wasn't the solution to the explosions.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.300]   I was the cause of these explosions.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.940]   And this looked like friendships that went south.
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.740]   All of a sudden, my words would get out of control.
[00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.700]   I would escalate to an explosion,
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.580]   and those friendships would end.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.900]   I mean, there are people that I no longer talk to
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.180]   because they won't talk to me because of the way
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.620]   that I treated them when I look backwards.
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.220]   I mean, people that I still to this day
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.580]   effort to reconcile with.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.620]   True story.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.300]   There are relationships, girls that I've
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.380]   dated that ended because of my terrible, terrible anger.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.900]   OK?
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.900]   There were times I could think back in competitions
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.700]   or like playing basketball.
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.140]   And all of the sudden, blocking somebody out in the key
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.300]   turns to a fist fight.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.500]   You're like, how did we get here?
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.260]   And it's because of this topic of anger.
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.940]   And I had no idea I wasn't trained in being the solution.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.220]   Well, the other day, my wife and I, my wife Monica and I,
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.860]   went on a date.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.220]   It was about three weeks ago.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.660]   Had a sitter come, watched the kids, got in.
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.780]   Excited to go see a movie.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.540]   We're in my truck.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.740]   We're driving down Arapaho.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.140]   And just going the speed limit, same lane.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.180]   And this car turned left into a parking lot right in front
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.740]   of me.
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.020]   There's a car to my right, a car to my left.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.900]   I have nowhere to go.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.020]   I slam on the brakes and slowly hit them.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.100]   We pull into the parking lot.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.580]   I didn't anticipate being in a wreck that day.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.820]   I'm just like, man, did this happen?
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.540]   Everything happens in slow motion.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.300]   I don't know if you've been in a wreck,
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.340]   but your world's kind of spinning.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.620]   You're like, what just happened?
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.060]   I get out of the car to talk to the young lady that
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.620]   was driving.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.500]   She's on her phone.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.460]   Of course she was.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.820]   And she's erratic, honestly.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.820]   She's going crazy.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.420]   And she just is like, I can't believe, oh man,
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.060]   I can't believe this guy.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.380]   He just came out of nowhere.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.140]   I'm like, well, it wasn't really nowhere.
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.100]   It was kind of--
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.940]   came from Hillcrest, you know?
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.980]   And I was like, hey, could we talk?
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.540]   And she's like, she's looking straight at me.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:24.380]   And I'm like this.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.780]   And she's like, I can't believe this MF.
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.980]   He just came out of nowhere.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.660]   I'm like, whoa, OK.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.620]   And so I call 911.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.860]   And they're like, does she have insurance?
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.700]   I'm like, excuse me, not trying to interrupt your phone call,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.660]   but do you have insurance?
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.940]   She's like, this is my boyfriend's car.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.180]   This is my boyfriend's car.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.060]   Cool.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.820]   Does your-- I go 911.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.260]   It's like, it's her boyfriend's car.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.100]   So the 911 person goes, does her boyfriend have insurance?
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.620]   Does your boyfriend have insurance?
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.340]   So we kind of together go through the glove box,
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.540]   find the insurance card, get that.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.740]   I call from the situation.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.220]   She's still on the phone.
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.620]   And so I call the insurance company right away.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.660]   I'm sitting there.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.180]   You know, both of our vehicles pretty badly damaged.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.820]   And I'm on the phone with the insurance company.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.580]   And I'm explaining to them what happened.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.380]   And now about 25 minutes have gone by.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.940]   And the boyfriend gets there.
[00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.340]   Now, if she was acting crazy, he was that times 10.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.220]   And so I knew he was there because I kept hearing MF,
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.900]   if you will, very loud.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.540]   He's walking around the car.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.860]   And he's like, oh, this MF, you know, I can't believe-- oh,
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.340]   man.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.620]   And he kind of buries his head in his hands.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.740]   And he's shaking.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.640]   And I'm on the phone with his insurance company.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.320]   And so he comes up to the window.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.260]   And he goes-- like, puts his hands over his mouth.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.140]   And he goes, get the F out of the car.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:09:05.660]   I'm like-- I was on the speaker, like, with his--
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.860]   it's like, did you hear that?
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.500]   I got to go.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.620]   And so, like, here's the deal.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.180]   For most of my life, this would have ended in one of two ways,
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.680]   right?
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.940]   Fight or flight.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.540]   I would have said, man, I don't want to deal with that.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.700]   Like, there's an explosion outside my car right now.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.940]   I don't want to get burned, if you will.
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.020]   And so I'm going.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.340]   Or somebody needs to teach this guy a lesson.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.100]   And I think the Lord and sovereignty just elected me.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.620]   And so it was one of those two things.
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.900]   And a lot of you, like, if you were sitting there,
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.260]   like, you got to think, what would you do?
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.940]   Because a lot of you would be like, man,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.780]   I have no idea what to do.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.780]   I don't know what I would do in that situation.
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.400]   Man, I just don't know what I would do.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.100]   You know what the Bible tells us what to do in that situation?
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.220]   Took a deep breath, said a prayer, get out of the car,
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.140]   said, how you doing, bud?
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.660]   He continues with the explicatives.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.740]   Tells me that I'm going to tell the officer that he
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.140]   was driving the vehicle.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.820]   Said, I just can't do that, man.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.660]   I said, in fact, before we move any further,
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.140]   I just need to tell you that your words hurt me.
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.860]   What you said in front of my wife a second ago,
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.340]   that wasn't cool.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.020]   And I'd like to talk this out with you.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.660]   And he kind of looked at me and kind of goes, I'm sorry.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.500]   And I said, hey, man, no problem.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.860]   Let's work this out, you know?
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.260]   And then we did.
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260]   And we proceeded to talk through the details.
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.900]   I kind of talked them off that cliff.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.980]   I asked them both if they had a faith.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.660]   I engaged them.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.500]   I told them about a God that I believe in,
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.260]   that I can trust in.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.780]   I told them they could trust in the same God if they knew him.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.780]   They said that they did.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.260]   I said, well, then, you know, what
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.300]   is the relationship with him if we can't trust him
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.820]   in situations like this?
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.180]   And we talked through the situation.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.020]   But I tell you that because for most of my life,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.820]   that would have turned out very poorly
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.820]   because I wasn't trained in how to handle conflict.
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.700]   But now, as I've understood the scriptures,
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.180]   it gives us some real practical advice
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.860]   in how to handle conflict.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.700]   So tonight, we're talking about responding to anger.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.300]   And you might think, well, I don't really get angry.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.020]   I mean, that hadn't happened to me.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.780]   I haven't been in a car wreck.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.620]   And so I don't--
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.020]   tonight's going to be lost on me.
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.220]   I wish we were talking about something else.
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.820]   Well, let me just run through some scenarios in front of you
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.060]   just to make sure that's true.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.540]   One is, I don't know if you've ever sat or called you
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.940]   need help with your cell phone.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.940]   And you get the press one for this, press two for this.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:48.820]   And I'm like, I just want to talk to somebody.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.140]   And they're like, due to high call volumes right now,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.220]   your call will be answered in the order that it was received,
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.780]   which is evidently number 6,792.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.300]   And you sit there on hold for 42 minutes
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.940]   only to talk to someone who doesn't speak your language
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.180]   very well.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.900]   And they are incompetent in the issue which you have.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.260]   And they begin to troubleshoot with all the things
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:14.820]   you've already done.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.140]   Yes, I've already turned it off and on.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.980]   Yes, yes, I have.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.980]   No, you want me to do it?
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.380]   OK, I've done that though, right?
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.740]   So I don't know if that makes you angry.
[00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.340]   Maybe not.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   And so I don't know if you've ever
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.540]   been at a stoplight that turns green.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.180]   But because it takes you a total of five seconds
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.740]   to remove your hand-- your foot, rather-- from the brake
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.260]   to the gas, someone lays on the horn behind you.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.220]   I don't know what is so offensive about a honk,
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.340]   but it is just offensive.
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.740]   I mean, it just infuriates me.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:50.060]   Or-- this happened last week to me-- you get takeout,
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.860]   and you get home, and they forgot your burger.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.540]   Just me, huh?
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.620]   What traffic, man.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.740]   Like, do you ever do this?
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.820]   You just sit in parked on a freeway,
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.100]   and you're like, this is so simple, people.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.500]   Like, if we just all drive 70 miles an hour.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.660]   You know?
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.820]   Like, who is the person in the front
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.620]   that decided to park their car in the middle of the freeway?
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.500]   Like, why would we do that?
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.100]   And then you drive up, and it's an elderly person.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.460]   You're just like, somebody should take your license away.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:27.980]   You know?
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.700]   And I don't know what that is.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.900]   But I don't know how Jesus would have handled that situation,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.340]   but I'm confident, different than I do.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:36.820]   Right?
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.220]   There's just something in me that wells up.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.780]   And so we're moving through this series, right?
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.460]   And we're talking about the things
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.940]   that Jesus addressed in the most famous sermon of all time.
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.540]   And tonight, he's going to say some crazy things about anger.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.820]   In fact, some of you are just even uncomfortable
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.980]   with the things I said.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.660]   And so what if Jesus stood up here, and he said, hey,
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.180]   if you ever get angry, you're probably going to go to hell.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.620]   What if I said that?
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.340]   What if I came out here, and I said, hey.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.460]   Hey, guys, good to be here.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.940]   Welcome to the porch.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.820]   Hey, if you've ever been angry, you're probably going to hell.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.380]   Like, wouldn't you all be like, man, this dude's lost his mind.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.180]   He's crazy.
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.100]   Tonight, Jesus is going to say that.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.020]   That's almost verbatim what he says.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.260]   Now, there's an interpretive challenge there
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.860]   that we're going to have to explain, and bring to the light,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.940]   and understand better.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.780]   And so that's what's before us.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.900]   But he talks that-- he says, hey, you getting angry really,
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.300]   really, really matters to God.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.020]   And so in this series, Summer on the Mount, where Jesus covers--
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.740]   if you went home, and you read the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.020]   it would take you about 15 minutes
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.060]   to read it, beginning to end.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.660]   He covers law, missions, adultery, lust, love, hate,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.780]   judgment, marriage, divorce, enemies, the poor, prayer,
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.260]   anxiety, materialism, heaven and hell, and much more in 15
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.060]   minutes.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.980]   And so tonight, we're just going to take this topic of anger.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.820]   Matthew 5, verse 21.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:05.540]   We're going to look at a change in perspective, a part to own,
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.860]   and a path to pursue.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.380]   Verse 21.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.220]   "You've heard that it was said to the people long ago,
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.900]   you shall not murder.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.540]   And anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.620]   But I tell you that anyone who--" uh-oh.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.380]   Because I'm like, man, I haven't murdered anybody, so I'm good.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.020]   But then he goes, "I tell you, anyone
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.380]   who is angry with a brother or sister
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.220]   will be subject to judgment.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.740]   Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister,
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.260]   'raka,'" which just means worthless,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.300]   which is just using your words to make someone feel
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.980]   undervalued or hurt, "is answerable to the court.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.260]   And anyone who says you fool will be
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.180]   in danger of the fire of hell."
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.820]   Did you hear that?
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.540]   Jesus Christ on the earth said, you call someone a fool,
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.080]   you're going to be in danger of hell.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.960]   Now, how do we reconcile that with the gospel?
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.580]   I mean, those are Jesus's words.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.500]   Jesus said that.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.220]   What is he saying there?
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.740]   Jesus is talking about a response to anger.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.620]   He's not just talking about you even acting out on it.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.380]   He's talking about what your thoughts are,
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.220]   you feeling the emotion, you giving into the emotion,
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.700]   you turning that emotion into words.
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.620]   And so being a Christian means restraining our response
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.700]   to anger and yielding it to God's spirit.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.580]   And I think that many of us, we see anger as an opportunity,
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.740]   or we see conflict as an opportunity to display our anger,
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.060]   when really it's a very, very different opportunity.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.660]   It's an opportunity to display the one we worship.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.980]   Conflict is an opportunity to bring our anger
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.060]   under the Spirit's control.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.900]   And so my first point is a perspective to change.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.340]   He says it's not just acting out of anger,
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.620]   it's entertaining the thought of anger.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.420]   It's driving down the road and letting that kind of wheel
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.300]   continue to turn, you taking a shower,
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.260]   the person's not even there, but you're talking to 'em
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.500]   and you're ahead and you're getting all frustrated.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.780]   These are the things that Jesus is talking about.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.580]   And he compares it to murder, which seems to be crazy.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.660]   Like if we didn't have these words, and I just got here
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.920]   and I said, hey, you getting angry at traffic
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.960]   is the same as you taking a nine millimeter
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.260]   and taking someone's life.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.900]   Like you guys would be like, that's crazy,
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.380]   but that's what Jesus says.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.340]   And in Leviticus 27, this is Levitical law, verse 17,
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.900]   he says anyone who takes the life of a human being
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.440]   is to be put to death.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.060]   Jesus is saying that if you get angry, you deserve to die.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.020]   How could he say that?
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:45.180]   Why is he saying that at this section in the sermon?
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.580]   Why would he put this in front of the Pharisees
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.460]   and the Sadducees and his disciples?
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.860]   It's like he's gonna lose all credibility right up top,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.460]   and he's telling them that their heart is messed up.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.140]   He's saying, hey, your heart is messed up.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.220]   Even if no one sees it, God sees it.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.980]   Like some of you, you're here and you're like,
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.740]   yeah, but I don't really get angry, right?
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.540]   Like let me just show you a picture
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:10.860]   of Angry Andrew and Suzy's Sunday school here.
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.540]   And so there's Angry Andrew, and you're like,
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.100]   yeah, of course, of course, you know, he's angry.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.140]   Like he might fight in the UFC or something.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.820]   Like he's, yeah, he's angry.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.220]   You know, he may do something crazy.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.220]   But look at her though.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.260]   I mean, she's got it all together.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.900]   She's carrying her Bible on her way to Sunday school.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.060]   I mean, she loves Jesus, and her dad's a pastor,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.980]   and everything is amazing in her world.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.660]   But let me, but we can't see her thoughts.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.620]   Like what if we could see her thoughts?
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.580]   Oh.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.500]   Oh, and Jesus says, you're just as bad as he is.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.180]   Jesus says, Suzy's Sunday school, you're the same.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.180]   You see, none of you are off the hook.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.020]   No one here is off the hook.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.580]   You've all had those thoughts.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.580]   You have all said you fool to someone,
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.940]   at least in your mind, to God's creation.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.460]   And he says, you're susceptible to death, the death penalty.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:14.620]   And so anger is an opportunity to respond in the flesh
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.820]   or to respond in the spirit, which is worship.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.260]   See, some of the greatest opportunities
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.220]   for Christ followers, Christians, believers,
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.320]   to display their faith is situations of conflict.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.740]   People tell me all the time, see, conflict
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.380]   is not a bad thing.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.660]   That's the change in perspective
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.100]   that you have to have right now.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.500]   Conflict is not bad.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.340]   People tell me all the time, like,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.380]   man, we have a great relationship.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.620]   We don't fight, we don't have conflict.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.260]   You don't have a relationship.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.380]   That's not a real relationship.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.300]   You're like, oh yeah, we have a great relationship.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.780]   We've never even had an argument.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.260]   I'm like, have y'all talked?
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.500]   You know, I mean, do you know each other?
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140]   What does that mean, right?
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.180]   I mean, how can you have a relationship
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.460]   and not have conflict with someone?
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.780]   Because God made us, we are all now,
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.740]   as God put us here, and after the fall,
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.900]   because of our own choice, because of our own decisions,
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.900]   now we live in this broken world,
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.700]   and relationships are frankly marked by conflict.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.620]   Healthy relationships are marked by conflict.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.120]   Unresolved conflict marks the lives of unhealthy people.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:18.960]   Let me say that again.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.700]   Healthy relationships are marked by conflict,
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.460]   but unresolved conflict marks the lives of unhealthy people.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.500]   Okay?
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.240]   Now, I'm not saying that you should stay
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.060]   in that relationship where you fight all the time.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.820]   You probably should not,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.420]   because the fact that you fight all the time
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.500]   might mean, in reality, that you haven't learned
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.260]   how to resolve conflict,
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.460]   but it is an opportunity to display your faith.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.740]   Ephesians 4:3 says, "Make every effort,"
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.740]   your Bible might say, "Be diligent, work hard at,
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.660]   "keeping the unity of the Spirit
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.760]   "through the bond of peace."
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.440]   This is something that we work really, really hard at.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.400]   Hard conversations are not fun,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.000]   but they are not optional either.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.820]   Let me say that again.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.280]   Hard conversations are not fun,
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.400]   but they are not optional either.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.920]   80% of what I do on staff at Watermark Community Church
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.400]   is resolve conflict.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.140]   80%, you might be like, "Wow, that's really dysfunctional."
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.860]   80% of what I do is working through conflict,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.180]   which means 100% of what I do is discipleship,
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:29.800]   because when we do this the right way,
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.580]   it displays who we worship,
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.220]   it displays who we belong to,
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.560]   it displays who we love,
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.520]   it displays who we're controlled by.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.780]   And so when you feel angry, that is just a warning light.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.260]   It's the way that you respond to that angry
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.540]   that shows who you're controlled by.
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.540]   The other day, we're driving through,
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.540]   driving in Monica's Suburban, my wife's Suburban,
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.980]   and the check engine light comes on,
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.660]   which is never fun, right, just 'cause I don't know.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.680]   But when that light comes on, I have some options, right?
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.540]   I can ignore it.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.420]   I can just be like, "Ah, you know,
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.340]   "it's probably a sensor or something,"
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.320]   and that doesn't go well.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.120]   I can overreact to it.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.620]   I can be like, "What, check engine light comes on?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.660]   "Leave your car right here.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.600]   "We're gonna go buy a new one.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.440]   "Let's go, you know, we'll give this thing away,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.540]   "piece of trash."
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.700]   No, right, right?
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.260]   I can overreact to it,
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.620]   or I can work really hard to find out what it is,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.900]   which costs money and time,
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.460]   but it's the right thing to do.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.940]   And so your anger is the same way.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.540]   When you feel angry, you can ignore it.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.140]   You can try to press it down, okay?
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.740]   You can overreact, you can explode,
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.820]   or you can put in the work
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.660]   to find out what's really going on.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.820]   When someone feels anger towards you, right,
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.420]   you can overreact, you can ignore it,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.660]   or you can put in the work,
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.580]   "Hey, we gotta talk.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.860]   "Hey, come here, look at me.
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.860]   "We gotta talk.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.660]   "Let's talk.
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.480]   "Now, I know you don't want to.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   "I know you're so mad at me,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.180]   "but I really wanna understand why."
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.620]   And this is not natural to us.
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.300]   It is not natural to many of you in the room.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.660]   That is the most scary thing that I could possibly say.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.300]   You want me to talk to someone when I hate them?
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.860]   Yes.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.620]   Yes, I do.
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.900]   I want you to look them in the eyes,
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.900]   and I want you to work really, really hard
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.180]   at resolving the conflict,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.220]   because it displays the Spirit of God at work in your life.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.560]   And so what does it look like to respond in the Spirit?
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.400]   Verse 23.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.820]   Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar,
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.220]   and there, remember that your brother or sister
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.000]   has something against you,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.060]   leave your gift there in front of the altar.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.540]   First, go and be reconciled to them.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.180]   Then, come and offer your gift.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.980]   Did you hear what God just said to you?
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.640]   He says, "Don't come to me and seek forgiveness from me.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.660]   "Don't bring a forgiveness offering to me
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.640]   "before you've sought forgiveness from them.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.420]   "Don't come to me and worship me."
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.740]   He says, "I'm prioritizing.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.440]   "I'm prioritizing horizontal relationships
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.180]   "over this vertical relationship.
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.160]   "And if you have broken horizontal relationships,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.800]   "then you have a broken vertical relationship,
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.460]   "and you need to go and reconcile those."
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.220]   Do you know what this means?
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.060]   Like, you're here, and you're like,
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.060]   "Wow, Jason and Jackie Castro were singing."
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.980]   And God says, "Stop.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.740]   "Stop worshiping me.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.360]   "You need to go and be reconciled to that brother,
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.680]   "to that sister, to that mom, to that dad, to that roommate,
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.880]   "to that friend, to that boyfriend, girlfriend,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.340]   "ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend, co-worker, boss.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.340]   "Stop worshiping me, and go and be reconciled to them."
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.900]   This is serious.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.440]   Like, Jesus is saying that some of you,
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.760]   frankly, need to leave.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:50.740]   Like, pretend you're going to the bathroom or something,
[00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.420]   and go, and get on southwest.com and buy a plane ticket,
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.780]   or americanairlines.com, and you need to go home,
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.100]   and you need to sit in front of someone,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.060]   and you need to make it right.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.260]   That's what he's saying.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.900]   He says, "Hey, you're carrying something
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.460]   "that I don't want you carrying.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.600]   "I want you to go and make it right."
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.580]   And the second point this evening is a part to own.
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.540]   What is the part that you need to own?
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:23.140]   As simply as I can say it, yours.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.900]   Own your part.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.420]   You have a part in the conflict.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.120]   If you are a part of the conflict,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.700]   you have a part in the conflict.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.540]   Let me say that again.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.540]   If you are a part of the conflict,
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.260]   you have a part in the conflict.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.240]   Now, be very, very, very careful,
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.900]   because anger does something weird to us.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.700]   It makes us very blind.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.860]   We cannot see our part in the conflict.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.460]   Whenever we feel angry,
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.300]   we can only see their part in the conflict.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.860]   This is why Jesus says, "Don't judge the speck in their eye
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.580]   "when you're walking around with a two-by-four
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.020]   "sticking out of yours," right?
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.580]   Because when you feel angry,
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.220]   you cannot see your part in the conflict.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.660]   Now, I'm gonna tell you a story
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.100]   that really paints the picture of what I'm talking about.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.740]   There was a young man who was marked.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.940]   It was a friend of mine, pastored and shepherded,
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.160]   this young man, and his life was marked
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.360]   by anger and bitterness.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.500]   And if any of you met him, you would know why,
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.580]   and you would get it, and you would, like,
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.920]   I understand it, and I don't even hold that against you.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.160]   The reason his life was marked by anger and bitterness
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.920]   is because his father beat him nearly every day of his life.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.080]   Okay, this is what it looked like.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.480]   His dad would get drunk, and his dad would beat his mom.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.320]   He would hide behind the stove,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.160]   and one day, his dad found his hiding spot,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.100]   which means he stopped beating mom and began to beat him.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.520]   And that's what marked, that was his lot in life.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.320]   As a four-year-old, as a five-year-old,
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.000]   as a six-year-old, as a seven-year-old,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.560]   as a eight-year-old, on until he was an adult.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.440]   Every week of his life, his father beat him.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.920]   And so someone came into his life
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.400]   and began to share Jesus, and he said,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.320]   "I get forgiveness, but there's no way
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.800]   "I can forgive that man."
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.440]   And as my friend was talking to him,
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.740]   my friend just said, "Well, do you have any part
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.760]   "in the conflict?"
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.360]   And he said, "What don't you understand?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.820]   "My dad beat me nearly every day of my life."
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:07.800]   'Cause I get that.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.720]   But as you look back, is there anything that you can own?
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.900]   Like if we're looking at 100% of the conflict,
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.740]   is there anything that you could own?
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:22.900]   And he said, "Yeah, I mean, of course I was disrespectful.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.600]   "Of course I ran from him.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.520]   "Of course I said terrible things.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.860]   "I've hated him for over a decade."
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.020]   He said, "Well, do you think you could own that 2%?
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.660]   "Do you think you could own 100% of that 2%?"
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.480]   It sounds like your dad's at 98% fault,
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.600]   like this is all him.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.680]   But you've got 2%.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.700]   Do you think you could go to him
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.940]   and own 100% of your 2%?
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.720]   And the Spirit of God moved in that man's life,
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.060]   and he went to his father.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.800]   He drove home.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.240]   And this is father was poor in health.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.220]   And he said, "Dad, I wanna ask your forgiveness
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.440]   "for the way that I've hated you.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.400]   "I wanna ask your forgiveness
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.480]   "for the things I've said about you.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.860]   "I wanna ask your forgiveness
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.060]   "for the ways that I was disrespectful to you."
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.540]   And he didn't even say,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.220]   because what's the terrible things you did.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.620]   He just said, "I wanna own 100% of my part."
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.420]   Which is only 2%.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.500]   But 100% of my part.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.100]   You know what the dad did?
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.940]   Broke down in tears, fell to his knees,
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.500]   and trusted Christ right there.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.320]   And turned and asked his forgiveness to him.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.180]   Didn't even know how,
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.340]   but just said he was sorry over and over and over
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.540]   and over and over and over.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.900]   And that's what God is going for here.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.780]   If you can own 100% of your 1%, your 0.5%,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.300]   but if you are a part of the conflict,
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.860]   you have a part in the conflict.
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.500]   No one understand, no and understand your part
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.420]   in the conflict, right?
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.240]   Like who is it?
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.320]   Like we see the explosion, we see the heat,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.820]   we see the fire and we wanna run.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.380]   Who runs towards the fire?
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.380]   SWAT team, bomb squad, FBI.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.940]   People who are trained to deal with it.
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.660]   When everyone else is running away,
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.940]   we are those crazy, crazy people that say,
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.780]   "No, we know the one true God, we're running in
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.820]   and we're gonna make this right.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.820]   We're gonna disarm this situation.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.740]   We've been trained to do so."
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.320]   And so understand if you're angry, right?
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.800]   Resist the urge to have the conversations in your head.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.160]   Resist the urge to gossip and talk to other people.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.320]   Don't assume you know why they did that
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.400]   or why they're doing what they did.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.840]   You know when I saw that guy drive into that gas pump,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.640]   I was like, "Man, this idiot drunk, right?
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   He's drunk, that's why he did it."
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.360]   Like I just assumed I knew why he drove into that gas pump.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.040]   No, no, no, he had a diabetic, he went into diabetic shock.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.400]   It's a 70 year old man, right?
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.820]   Don't assume anything.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.260]   You don't know what's going on in their lives.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.940]   You don't know the road they walked.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.100]   You don't know why they're angry.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.580]   You don't have the full picture.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.280]   Go and seek to understand.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:08.900]   If you have something to own, the challenge is to find it.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.380]   Not just to find it, but to find it quickly.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.900]   Jesus speaks towards eagerness.
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.540]   Ephesians 4:26 says, "In your anger do not sin.
[00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.820]   Do not let the sun go down while you're still angry."
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.380]   Go eagerness.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.600]   And I'm gonna give you some powerful words, you ready?
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.240]   Will you forgive me?
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.160]   Not I'm sorry, right?
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.760]   You could say, "Hey, I'm sorry."
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.720]   And they could say, "You are sorry, you're right.
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.760]   You're sorry.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.120]   You're a sorry person, you're a sorry individual."
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.880]   You go and you say, "Will you forgive me?"
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   These are the words Christ gave us.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.760]   Will you forgive me?
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.840]   Not will you forgive me but.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.820]   Not will you forgive me and.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.760]   But will you forgive me for.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.220]   Will you forgive me for what I've done.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.200]   Not will you forgive me but you did a bunch of things.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:07.480]   Not will you forgive me for the ways I let you hurt me.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.700]   Don't be strategic.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:14.400]   Will you forgive me for and own 100% of your 2%.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.300]   What does this look like?
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.760]   You know, so I left that situation with my car
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.340]   and thought we had it resolved.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.320]   I explained to the boyfriend,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.360]   "Hey bro, my wife and I were driving down the road
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.960]   when your girlfriend turned in front of me
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.340]   like in oncoming traffic."
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:37.720]   I mean, this is, you know, he was like,
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.180]   "It doesn't really matter whose fault it is."
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.800]   I was like, "It kind of matters whose fault it is.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.080]   It's called the deductible."
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   And so I left thinking we had the understanding
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.720]   but then they filed a claim on my insurance.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.520]   I was like, "Man, that's confusing."
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.840]   And then their insurance was very difficult to work with.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.240]   And then I got in a rental truck,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.040]   which I'm still in today, and they called and they said,
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.880]   "Hey, we just wanna let you know your rental expires.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.680]   We feel like it's taking you too long to fix your truck."
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.880]   And I'm like, "You know I've been emailing you every day
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.800]   asking you this very question
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.080]   and you haven't responded to me."
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.120]   And I'm feeling all these things
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.840]   and I'm hating this woman, frankly,
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   and I'm so frustrated and I'm on vacation, by the way.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.000]   I'm on vacation with my family and I get this car,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.380]   I'm out of town and they say,
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.000]   "Hey, you need to return your rental car today.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.840]   It expires."
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.000]   And I'm just like, "What?"
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.120]   And I feel like just crazy.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.160]   Praise God for my wife.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.520]   She kind of talks me off this cliff.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.640]   And so I call this woman, I'm like,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.380]   "Sandra, will you forgive me?
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.400]   Will you forgive me for being impatient with you?
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.200]   Will you forgive me for repeatedly emailing you?"
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.320]   I'm sure that's frustrating.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.600]   I'm sure you've got a lot of things going on.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.080]   And, "Will you forgive me for?"
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.120]   And we were able to work it out.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.040]   But sometimes you're not.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.080]   Sometimes it does not go well, okay?
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.600]   You have to trust God.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   You do not judge obedience by the outcome.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.800]   You judge obedience by obedience.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.520]   Do not judge obedience by what happens or how it turns out
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.620]   or you don't look back and say,
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.460]   "Well, that turned out well.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.520]   I must have done the right thing."
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.680]   Sometimes you do the right thing
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.040]   and it turns out really, really bad
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.680]   and God makes sense of it in heaven.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.720]   But you be obedient.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.800]   Let's go, verse 25.
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.880]   "Settle matters quickly with your adversary
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.160]   who is taking you to court.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.960]   Do it while you are still on the way
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.120]   or your adversary may hand you over to the judge
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.000]   and the judge may hand you over to the officer
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.160]   and you may be thrown into prison.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.280]   Truly I tell you, you will not get out
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.160]   until you have paid the last penny."
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.560]   Okay, this is weird to me.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.940]   Like Jesus is saying these things.
[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.380]   He's like, "Hey, here's the deal.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.520]   You know, if you've been angry, it's like murder.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.600]   Leave your gift at the altar.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.040]   Run and be reconciled to your brother.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.880]   And if you're angry, you might go to hell."
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.040]   And by the way, let me give you some legal advice.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.080]   And I'm just like, "What?
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.560]   Like, what is he doing here?"
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.520]   He's like, "Yeah, and by the way,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.160]   if you're ever on your way to court,
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.080]   you know, this is how you wanna handle that conversation."
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.200]   What is Jesus saying here?
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.080]   He's saying to resolve conflict is costly.
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.460]   To not resolve conflict is more costly.
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.520]   To resolve conflict is hard and difficult
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.880]   and you might get burned.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.020]   But if you do not resolve the conflict,
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.080]   you will always get burned.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.880]   And when we're on the way to court,
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.960]   what are we thinking about, right?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.600]   We're thinking about winning.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.800]   We're thinking about winning.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.520]   He says, "I want you to stop thinking about winning.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:31.440]   And I want you to start thinking about what you can do
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.200]   to resolve the conflict.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.960]   How you can pursue peace in the conflict."
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.620]   Because here's the deal, and I want you to write this down,
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.120]   tweet it out, tell everyone.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   "The person who seeks to win in conflict always loses."
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:49.520]   The person who seeks to win in conflict always,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.200]   always loses.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.640]   That person never wins.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.600]   They may get the upper hand,
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.280]   you may feel good for two seconds.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.280]   But then you realize you lost a friend.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.960]   Then you realize you ruined your witness.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.560]   Then you realize you did not respond according to the spirit
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.760]   that you said that you have.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:16.480]   And so I'm calling you to be the bigger person.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.200]   Jesus is calling you to be the bigger person,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.680]   to seek reconciliation and not to wait on them.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.400]   Not to sit there and think,
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.600]   "Well, if they call me, then maybe I will."
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.560]   No, no, you call them.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.360]   You show up on their doorstep, you knock.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.280]   You say, "I'm here, I wanna make this right.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.960]   "I wanna work this out."
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.460]   My third point and final point is a path to pursue.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.740]   And here's the path worthy of pursuit.
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.480]   Okay, and what is that path?
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.000]   It's the path of peace.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.960]   Pursue the path of peace.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.400]   And some of you are like, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.160]   "Should I do this in every situation,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.080]   "every time I'm angry?
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.600]   "Should I go and sit down and have the conversation?"
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.160]   No.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.080]   The scripture says, "Overlook a small offense."
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.320]   Okay, and so it's specifically Proverbs 19, verse 11.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.120]   "A person's wisdom yields patience.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.440]   "It is to one's glory to overlook a small offense
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.920]   "or to overlook an offense."
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.280]   And so let me ask you this.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.760]   You say, "Well, how do I know
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.720]   "if I should overlook it or not?
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.760]   "How do I know if I should overlook it
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.960]   "or have the conversation?"
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.080]   It's simple, ready?
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.420]   If you can overlook it, you should.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.360]   If you don't overlook it, you need to have the conversation.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.200]   What does that mean?
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.020]   Make it more practical.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.240]   If you're driving down the road
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.920]   and you're having angry conversations
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.240]   with them in your head, you have not overlooked it.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.320]   You gotta have the conversation, okay?
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.760]   If you're sitting there and you continue to think about it,
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.600]   you haven't overlooked it.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.800]   If you don't think about it anymore, you've overlooked it
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.640]   and you won't have to worry.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.420]   The overlooking part kinda happens naturally.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.120]   But if you haven't overlooked it,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.240]   if you continue to think about it,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.120]   you don't go to a friend and say,
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.620]   "Hey, I just gotta vet this situation to you."
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.680]   No, no, no, you only talk to people
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.120]   who are a part of the conflict,
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.080]   a part of the problem, or a part of the solution, okay?
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.240]   You don't vet to other people.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.680]   You don't say, "Hey, let me just get this off my chest.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.020]   "Hey, can I just tell you if I,
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.260]   "let me ask you if I should go to them.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.160]   "Let me just get your advice.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.920]   "Don't turn your prayer request into gossip.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.000]   "Hey, can we just pray for David Marvin?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.440]   "I mean, he just, you know,
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.920]   "he really did some terrible things to me
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.680]   "and I just think we should pray for him."
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.160]   So, that's gossip.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.760]   Okay, some of you are praying for David.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.600]   I appreciate that.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.840]   (laughing)
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.360]   He appreciates it too.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.120]   Listen, that's gossip.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.920]   You only talk to people who are a part of the problem
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.540]   or a part of the solution and you wanna know what's best?
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.880]   Do it at the same time if you can.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.820]   Bring 'em all together.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.760]   Guys, can I tell you something?
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.500]   'Cause I can see you out there right now.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.660]   Like, I'm up here and I'm looking at you.
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.020]   I see you in Fort Worth too.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.740]   You're looking at me like I'm crazy.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.900]   Like, this is what the scripture calls you to do.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.100]   I'm serious.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.300]   I have seen this process change lives.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.420]   I have gone to Africa to train their government
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.460]   in the very things that I'm talking to you.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.220]   I've seen this change nations.
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.300]   True story.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.320]   We went to Rwanda after the genocide
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.760]   and talked about these very things.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.980]   Guys, I'm not kidding.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.280]   Christ is not kidding.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.460]   You know the number one determiner in success in a marriage
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.320]   is the ability to resolve conflict?
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.500]   The number one determiner of success in a marriage
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.440]   is the ability to resolve conflict.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.940]   This will make you a better employee, employer,
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.780]   friend, roommate, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.380]   anything, if you can do this, like it's discipleship.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.740]   If you can learn this and you can teach it to others,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.620]   you sit down in a small group and you teach them this,
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.760]   it is worthy of your time.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.780]   This will truly change your lives.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.620]   I'm not kidding.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.400]   You do this relentlessly.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.500]   You hold onto it fast.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:40.820]   Don't let anything change this.
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.860]   If you can overlook a small offense,
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.860]   overlook it if you can't, then have the conversation.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.620]   And be wise in the way you act toward outsiders.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.920]   Some of you are like, well, do I do this with nonbelievers?
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.640]   Sure, just don't expect them to respond well.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.600]   They're pagans.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.640]   It's their job description.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   They shouldn't respond well.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.300]   They should yell at you.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.560]   They should call you MF.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.240]   I mean, they should swing at you.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.160]   That's what they should do.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.800]   They're controlled by some other spirit.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.720]   So share the gospel and walk this process out of obedience.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.760]   And it may respond really, really poorly.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.440]   Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders,
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.560]   the scripture says.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.240]   Conflict is an opportunity to show whose you are.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:26.420]   I love the way that Jesus gives the Sermon on the Mount
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.000]   because he gives the application right up front.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.640]   He says in the Beatitudes, right?
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.480]   And so check this out.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.300]   I wanna show you something.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.240]   Matthew 5, verse nine.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.080]   He says this.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.900]   This is in the same sermon.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.200]   He says, "Blessed are the peacemakers,
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.480]   "for they will be called children of God."
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.400]   Do you see that the goal is just not,
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.880]   the goal is not to get angry.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.620]   The goal is not not to get angry.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.660]   Sorry, double negatives.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.000]   Always throws me off.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.060]   The goal is that you would be a peacemaker.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.280]   That you would make peace.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.800]   That you would be able to resolve these situations.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.400]   And he says that's who is children of God.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.040]   Those people are children of God.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.320]   Like I have, I'm tall.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.300]   I'm six foot, seven inches tall, okay?
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.080]   I have a son, he's two and a half years old.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.800]   But because he's my son, at two and a half,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.840]   he's about six feet tall.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.480]   I mean, he's really, really tall, you know?
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.320]   And he's just kinda, yeah, he's just tall.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.000]   He looks like me, he's crazy tall.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.560]   He looks like he's six years old.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.420]   And why?
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.000]   Because he has my DNA, he has my genes.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.720]   Jesus is saying, if you're God's children,
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.660]   you look like God, right?
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.720]   When my children act terrible, like we're in public
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.840]   and they're like just acting crazy,
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.220]   I'm always like, whose kids are these?
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.040]   Like somebody needs to make this right, right?
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.760]   But here's the, I know why they act that way.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.200]   I see my daughter's anger sometimes
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.040]   and I know where she gets it from.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.860]   'Cause she's my child.
[00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.560]   But you're a child of God.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.360]   And so you look like a child of God
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.020]   in the way you resolve conflict.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.460]   That's what Jesus is saying here.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.820]   Blessed are the peacemakers,
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.060]   for they will be called God's children.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.940]   And God's children make peace.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:01.280]   And be cautious of people who are entertained by conflict.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.540]   Like I had a buddy that would always just kinda be like,
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.540]   ooh, he said what, did you hear what he said?
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.940]   And like always kinda turning people against each other.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.700]   You know, he didn't know Christ.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:11.860]   And so of course he's gonna do that.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.120]   But be cautious about those people.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.400]   I wouldn't hang out with those people if I were you.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.780]   I mean, hang out with them to share the gospel,
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.500]   but not for any other reason.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.940]   Some of you are those people.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:22.100]   Proceed with caution.
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:26.060]   Go back and read the words of Christ here in Matthew 5.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.060]   Okay?
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:27.900]   Be careful.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.680]   And peace is powerful.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.420]   Let me just talk to the men for a second before we wrap up.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:40.500]   Men, any boy can turn his anger to throwing fists.
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.340]   I've got a two and a half year old
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.340]   and when he gets upset he pushes people.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.780]   Any child can do that.
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:53.720]   But it takes a man to bring your emotions,
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.400]   your childish emotions,
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.600]   under the control of the Spirit of God
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.240]   and respond in peace.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.320]   That takes a grown man.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.540]   And ladies, you grow up in a culture
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.880]   where it's cool to be sassy and feisty
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.880]   and have attitude.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.740]   It's not cool in God's kingdom.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.040]   It might be cool in Dallas,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.560]   it might be cool in Fort Worth,
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.160]   it's not cool in God's kingdom.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.980]   Okay?
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.080]   That does not show that you're a child
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.480]   of the Creator of the heavens and the earth.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.560]   Okay?
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.020]   And so Jesus says,
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:36.680]   "Whenever you're angry, it's like murder.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.760]   "And murder requires the payment of a life."
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.040]   Now we don't resolve this
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.360]   in this little snippet of the sermon,
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.480]   but we know the bigger picture
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.920]   is that Jesus gave his life.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.760]   Jesus gave his life for your anger.
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.560]   Jesus gave his life so that you can be
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:53.800]   reconciled to the Father.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.080]   Jesus gave his life so that you don't have to be angry.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.660]   And so in summary, a new perspective
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.840]   is to see conflict as an opportunity
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.640]   to show who you belong to.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.360]   And this starts with you owning your part.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.860]   Be eager to own your part
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.400]   and to overlook a small offense if you can.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.780]   And the path that you are to pursue
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.360]   is the path of peace.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.400]   And I've seen incredible peace be brought about
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.480]   when people do this.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.560]   I've seen roommates reconciled.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.440]   I've seen wives who have been cheated on by their husbands
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.680]   reconcile with the mistress.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.640]   I've seen crazy things happen when people live this out.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.560]   Things that the world says,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.440]   "Who is your God?
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.640]   "How do you do this?"
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:38.920]   But after I gave this sermon,
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.120]   the first time someone came up,
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.580]   "What about righteous anger?
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.800]   "Isn't there a time we're supposed to get angry?"
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.240]   Anger is an emotion, right?
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.820]   Anger is a natural emotion.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.560]   It's what you do with that anger
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.160]   and how you target that anger
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.320]   and what is the end result of what you do with that anger
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.560]   that God cares about.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.720]   I think the thing that makes us the most angry,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.080]   if I was to put one word on it, it's injustice.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.320]   Like any time we feel like we've been treated unfairly
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.260]   or we've been slighted or taken advantage of,
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:15.060]   I had a truck and it had been in a hail storm,
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.740]   so it had all these hail dents on it
[00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.820]   and I bought it like that 'cause I like deals
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.220]   and it was a deal.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.940]   And so also because I like deals, I go on Craigslist
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.780]   and I find this painless dent repair company.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.740]   And so these guys come over to my house
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.500]   to fix these hail dents in my truck.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.420]   And they're there, it's four brothers.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.180]   And they're like, they're real kind, honestly.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.100]   Like they were super nice and shook my hand
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:38.980]   and we got to know each other
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.780]   and we were talking and I got to share the gospel.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:41.700]   Like hey, do you have a faith?
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.420]   And he asked me a lot of good questions.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.780]   I mean, he was like, what about dinosaurs
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.620]   and where are they in the Bible?
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.020]   And I was like, well, let's talk about that.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.900]   Some of you are like, what about dinosaurs?
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.220]   And so, we'll be up here, love to talk to you.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.060]   And so we were talking through like his,
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.180]   as he wrestled with faith
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.140]   and he put this red stuff on all the dents
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.920]   and they worked on my truck for a couple hours
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.580]   and he came in and he was like, oh, Mr. Picluda, listen man,
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.500]   I have great news.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.020]   You know, your truck was repaired
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.460]   and everything looks great
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.780]   and we're gonna paint the bumper tomorrow
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.060]   and so we'll be back in the morning.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.580]   And he's like, hey, what time will you be here?
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.460]   You know, will you be here at 9 a.m.?
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.980]   That's, we really like to get started early.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.820]   I'm like, sure.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.420]   And he goes, I'd like for you to pay, you know,
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.300]   for the dents today, but you can pay for the bumper tomorrow
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.620]   and so, and I'm like, oh, okay, that's, you know,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.460]   totally understand.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.380]   So we go to the ATM together.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.780]   I give him 800 bucks for the,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.260]   to remove the dents over all my truck
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.060]   and which is just a ton of money, by the way, to me.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.460]   And they leave and so the next day comes around,
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.300]   9 a.m. comes and I'm excited about getting my bumper painted
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.060]   and then 10 a.m. comes and 11 a.m.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.420]   so I call him and I'm like, hello, you know,
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.500]   hey, this is Jonathan, you know,
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.460]   you're gonna come and fix my bumper
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:50.780]   and I hear a dial tone.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:53.260]   I go, oh, that's weird.
[00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.180]   Maybe he actually hung up.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.020]   Call him again.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.660]   Hey, you're gonna come back and fix my bumper.
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.940]   And no one answers.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.460]   I leave message, leave another message,
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.500]   leave another message.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.420]   Call three days later, someone answered.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.180]   Hey, it's Jonathan, hang up again.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.420]   I'm like, uh-oh.
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.140]   Well, I still have this red stuff on my truck, right,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.500]   over all the dents that they fixed.
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.380]   And so I go get my truck washed to remove the red stuff
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.660]   to see how they had fixed the dents.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.660]   They didn't fix the dents.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.860]   They didn't do anything.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.500]   They just stole 800 bucks from me.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.780]   And man, I was so angry.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.940]   I'm a believer, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.680]   but I was so mad because they were good, frankly.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.740]   I mean, they had took advantage of me, okay.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.020]   We got to know each other.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.420]   I trusted these men.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.660]   I cared for them.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.460]   I prayed for them.
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.020]   And now I'm in this situation where I know
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.580]   they deliberately stole from me.
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.940]   And so I, they're just like, my mind runs towards revenge.
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.700]   I'm like, I'm thinking about how I'm gonna call
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.220]   from another person's phone and hey,
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.860]   I've got dents in my car and I'm gonna meet up
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.940]   with my boys in a tire iron and we're about to do work.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.860]   Like this, and I'm not even kidding.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.840]   Like honestly, I'm embarrassed to tell you
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.900]   those were the thoughts going.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.900]   I'm thinking, how can I get even?
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.580]   Like I'm smart enough to get even with these guys.
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.900]   I got a buddy that can find them.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.260]   I've got their phone number, like I'll have their address.
[00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.020]   Like I can get to these guys.
[00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.100]   I can get back, I can get my $800.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.140]   And all of this stuff was happening in my heart
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.600]   and I wasn't even fully aware of it.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.660]   And then a guy in my community goes, man, how you doing?
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.860]   I go, what do you mean, how am I doing?
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.140]   I'm angry.
[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:30.520]   She goes, can we read Matthew five?
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:33.280]   No!
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.920]   (congregation laughing)
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.120]   And he goes, Jonathan, he goes, why are you angry?
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.800]   And I said, because they took $800 from me.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.640]   This was a real cost.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:49.200]   I said, you don't understand, this was a real cost to me.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:56.360]   The next day, I go and we had deposited a check
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.760]   and so I go on my checking account
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.000]   and there's an additional $800 there.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   And my buddy who I told this to and he saw my anger,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.960]   he just went and he paid me 800 bucks.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.160]   And I call him, I said, why would you do that?
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.960]   I said, don't, that's crazy.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.800]   So why would you do that?
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.320]   He goes, bro, it's not worth your anger.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.800]   It's not worth you compromising your relationship with Christ
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.940]   because those guys took advantage of you.
[00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.020]   They don't know God, of course they did.
[00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.520]   That's what they should do.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.280]   He goes, but it's worth, I would pay $8,000
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.360]   so that you don't have to be angry.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.640]   And that's what Christ is saying.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.320]   He said, I'll give my life
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.560]   so that you don't have to be angry.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.960]   He said, people are gonna hurt you.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.740]   Don't trust people, trust God.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.080]   People are gonna hurt you.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.040]   You know you're gonna leave here.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.560]   People are gonna hurt, they're gonna outright
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.600]   take advantage of you.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.180]   You don't have to lay over, right?
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:56.440]   But you respond appropriately in the Spirit.
[00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.480]   Okay, if you don't know how to do that
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.400]   in this situation, you widen the circle
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.720]   and you bring others in.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.520]   You talk to people who are part of the solution
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.200]   and a part of the problem.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.520]   And you pursue the path of peace.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.880]   Let me pray that you would.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:15.640]   And Father, you tell us in Romans 12, verse 18
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.400]   that if it is possible,
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:22.860]   as far as it depends on us to live at peace with everyone.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:26.880]   Lord, we're wrestling because our hearts are wicked
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.920]   right now, we're wrestling with it.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.000]   Wait a minute, when do we do, do we always do that?
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.800]   When is it appropriate to lash out?
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.860]   When is it appropriate to respond to that hurt?
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.600]   And so Father, I pray that you would help us
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.720]   to understand what your Spirit desires in these situations.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.000]   God, for some of us tonight as we sit here,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.640]   the tape is playing of others who have hurt us
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.800]   or others we've hurt, and I pray that we would leave
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.720]   our gift at the altar and we would run
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.920]   and be reconciled to our brother and sister.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.200]   Father, I thank you for your word
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.400]   and how it never returns void,
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.180]   how it stirs our affections for you,
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.440]   it gives us a glimpse into your character
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.200]   and how you love us, that you would give your life
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:13.040]   so that we're not angry, so that we can be with you forever
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.640]   in a place of peace.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.840]   In Christ's name, amen.
