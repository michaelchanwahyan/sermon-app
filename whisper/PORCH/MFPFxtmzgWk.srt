1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
 - Well, good morning, Awaken.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,160
 How we doing today?

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,280
 (audience cheering)

4
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,560
 All right.

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,360
 Hey, my name is Timothy Atik,

6
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,840
 and I'm one of the teaching pastors here at Watermark.

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,920
 And prior to being here at Watermark,

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,600
 I was the director of a ministry called Breakway Ministries

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,800
 on the campus of Texas A&M.

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,080
 Sounds like we've got some Aggies here, which is awesome.

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,080
 And I'm just so glad to get to be here with you today.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,680
 What you need to know is I spend a lot of time writing.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,160
 Like I write sermons for a living,

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,400
 which means I do a lot of work in my home office.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,800
 And in my home office, I have two bookshelves

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,600
 that just sit in front of me all day, every day.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
 Now we moved from College Station to Dallas back in January.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,320
 And when we moved, there were certain things

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,000
 that we just put down, and over time,

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,880
 that became those things home.

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,040
 Like we never intended for those certain objects

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,320
 to live in those particular places,

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,040
 but over time, they just kind of made themselves at home,

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,320
 even though that's not where they belong.

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,280
 And so I just thought I would kind of share with you,

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,840
 as I was preparing for this message,

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,120
 I looked at those two bookshelves,

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,800
 and my eyes were opened, and I realized

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
 that there were things on the shelf

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,880
 that had been there for a long time

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,120
 that didn't actually belong.

32
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,240
 Like that's where my lint roller is.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,240
 Like it's on my bookcase, that's where I keep my lint roller.

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,200
 And there's a fishing license,

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
 and you're like, "Ah, he must be a fisher."

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
 I'm not.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,160
 This was, my father-in-law wanted to take my kids fishing,

38
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,840
 so I bought, this is the only fishing license

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,840
 I've ever bought in my life, probably the last one

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,640
 I'll ever buy, but this particular fishing license

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,480
 lives on my bookshelf.

42
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
 This is an iPhone 6, it's heading to a museum tomorrow,

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 but this has been living on my bookshelf for four months.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,560
 This is a used up Amazon gift card that's been there,

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,440
 and then this is the, this is the,

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,000
 you ever go to the Cracker Barrel,

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
 and there's that golf tee game?

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,080
 Well, this is the instructions for how to beat that game.

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,440
 And I have had it on my bookshelf for months,

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,440
 and this is a grocery sack of my ties,

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,080
 'cause I don't wear ties.

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,560
 The only time I wear a tie is when I'm officiating

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,000
 a wedding or officiating a funeral,

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,560
 and I wear the same tie every time.

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,920
 So these are just the ties that I've accumulated

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,680
 over the years that made the move

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
 and landed on my bookshelf.

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,840
 And some of you see that, and you don't get it.

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,880
 You're like, I don't understand how you live,

61
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,800
 because you're a neat freak,

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,960
 and so everything that you own has its place,

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,840
 and if it's no longer in its place, you get restless.

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
 Others of you, you get it.

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,880
 Like, I just wanna challenge you.

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,800
 Go and get in your car and just look around.

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,120
 Like, open up your console, open up your trunk,

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,320
 look in your back seat, snap a picture, tag Awaken.

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,320
 Let's see what has found a place in your car

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,960
 that's not where it belongs, but that's now where it lives.

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,080
 Or go look in your apartment.

72
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
 Just look around your room.

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,600
 Other people would come and be like,

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
 why is there a hockey stick in your kitchen?

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
 You're like, that's where it lives.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,040
 Like, that's just where it goes.

77
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,360
 That's our tendency, whether you realize it or not.

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,560
 There's certain things in your life,

79
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,480
 certain objects where you live

80
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,280
 that have kind of found a home,

81
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,800
 even though that's not where they belong.

82
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,240
 The reason I tell you that is because this morning,

83
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,000
 we're gonna look at a story in the Scriptures

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,560
 where Jesus is going to step into the house of God,

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,680
 and he's going to find some things

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
 that have made themselves at home,

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,400
 but that's really not where they belong,

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,520
 and he's going to do something about it.

89
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,760
 And the reason that I want us to look at this story

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
 is that it's just going to prompt us

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,240
 to have a really honest conversation.

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,360
 It's going to require each one of us

93
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,000
 to just look at the places where we worship.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,800
 I hope that you, I hope that there is a local church

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,560
 wherever you live, I hope that there is a place

96
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,120
 where you go that you would call your church home.

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,280
 And if not, no shame there,

98
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,960
 but hey, that is one of your to-dos when you leave awakened.

99
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,960
 But this is going to require us to just look at

100
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,480
 maybe the places where we call home for church

101
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
 or the places where we go to worship.

102
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
 It's just going to prompt us to evaluate,

103
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,960
 hey, have some things moved in

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
 and made themselves at home in those places

105
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
 that don't belong?

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400
 But then it's gonna require us to look inwardly

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,680
 and ask the question, hey, are there some things

108
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,160
 that have made themselves at home in my life

109
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,320
 or in my soul that just don't belong?

110
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,360
 See, the whole goal of this message

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
 is to move us towards health.

112
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,960
 Health as we worship together

113
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
 and health just as we live.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
 Like if we want our churches

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 to have their best days ahead with Jesus

116
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,560
 and if we individually want to have our best days ahead

117
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
 with Jesus, then we have to develop eyes

118
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,760
 to see the things in our worlds

119
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,600
 that have moved in and made themselves at home,

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,800
 but they just don't belong there.

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,840
 So if you have a Bible, I want you to turn with me

122
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,960
 this morning to John chapter two.

123
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,960
 John chapter two is where we are going to be today.

124
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:05,200
 John chapter two, this is a story about Jesus Christ

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,960
 stepping into the house of God, the temple,

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,040
 and cleansing it.

127
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,200
 It says this in John chapter two, verse 13.

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,080
 It says the Passover of the Jews was at hand

129
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,400
 and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

130
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,400
 In the temple, he found those who were selling oxen

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,520
 and sheep and pigeons and the money changers sitting there

132
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,760
 and making a whip of cords, he drove them all out

133
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,560
 of the temple with the sheep and oxen

134
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,160
 and he poured out the coins of the money changers

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,000
 and overturned their tables and he told those

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,040
 who sold the pigeons, take these things away.

137
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,040
 Do not make my father's house a house of trade.

138
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,720
 His disciples remembered that it was written,

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,320
 zeal for your house will consume me.

140
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,520
 So all eyes on me.

141
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,840
 This is a story where if you've seen Dude Perfect

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
 and you're familiar with the rage monster,

143
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,560
 Jesus goes rage monster in the temple.

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,680
 And the reason that that's important is because

145
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,680
 what we see is Jesus expressing deep passion and emotion.

146
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,920
 Anytime you read the scriptures, here's my encouragement.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,840
 Anytime you open up this book and you read

148
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,440
 that Jesus shows some strong emotion, take note

149
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 because you're observing what he cares about most.

150
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 So anytime you see him show really extreme passion

151
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,520
 or extreme compassion for people or when he's impressed

152
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,560
 by someone's faith or he's very angry, take note

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,760
 because that's what he cares about and we wanna care

154
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,360
 about what Jesus cares about.

155
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,200
 This is a story about Jesus cleansing the temple.

156
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,880
 So here's where I wanna start, okay, and follow me on this.

157
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,200
 But where I want to start today is with this reality.

158
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 Don't miss it.

159
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 Jesus cares deeply about the temple and so should Brie.

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,600
 Okay, that's where I wanna start.

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,200
 Jesus cares deeply about the temple and so should we.

162
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,960
 And when you hear that, that might hit you in a weird way

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,940
 because when you think about the temple,

164
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,080
 you think about like church for Jews.

165
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,800
 And if you're familiar with the Bible

166
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,960
 and you're familiar with the temple,

167
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,720
 then you know that the temple was a structure

168
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,080
 in the city of Jerusalem that doesn't even stand anymore.

169
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,000
 So for me to say Jesus cares deeply about the temple

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,040
 and so should we, there might be a disconnect there,

171
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,400
 but here's what you need to understand, okay.

172
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,400
 That the temple of God is not just a reference

173
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,000
 to a building that Jews worshiped at, okay.

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,240
 When you think temple, what I want you to think

175
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
 is presence of God.

176
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,920
 Because when you look and you read the scriptures,

177
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
 the temple of God was the main way that God declared

178
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,720
 to his people, I'm here.

179
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,960
 So the first temple in the Bible

180
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
 was actually the Garden of Eden.

181
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,240
 The Garden of Eden was considered the garden temple

182
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,080
 and God walked with Adam and Eve.

183
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,360
 So the Garden of Eden was God's declaration, I'm here.

184
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,840
 And then God led the nation of Israel

185
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,520
 out of captivity to Egypt.

186
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,480
 And as they're wandering in the wilderness,

187
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,080
 he instructs the leaders to erect a tabernacle,

188
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,440
 which was a temporary dwelling place for God,

189
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,320
 Exodus 25, eight says, let them make me a sanctuary.

190
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
 That's a reference to the tabernacle, why?

191
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,320
 That I may dwell in their mix.

192
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,200
 So the tabernacle was a declaration from God, I'm here.

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,960
 And then the nation of Israel made its way

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,880
 into the promised land and King Solomon

195
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,560
 built a permanent tabernacle known as the temple

196
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,760
 and the presence of God filled the temple

197
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,920
 and God declared to his people, I'm here.

198
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
 So when you hear me say that Jesus cares deeply

199
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,000
 about the temple and so should we,

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I want you to connect temple with presence of God.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Jesus refers to the temple as a house of prayer

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,720
 for all nations and so the temple was to be a place

203
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,600
 where people could come and meet with the God

204
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,400
 who was present in their midst, okay?

205
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
 So that's the background on temple.

206
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,040
 Now let's look at the story

207
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,720
 and I just want you to see what happens.

208
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,320
 Look again at verse 13, it says,

209
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,000
 the Passover of the Jews was at hand

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,120
 and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, okay?

211
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,720
 So Jerusalem was the city where the temple resided.

212
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,720
 To go to Jerusalem was to go to the city where God lives.

213
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
 Passover was basically, the Jewish people

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,080
 had a bunch of parties on their calendar.

215
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,000
 Like they did a lot of celebrating

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,920
 and the Passover was the most significant celebration

217
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,720
 where the entire nation would come together

218
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,800
 to reflect on and remember what God had done

219
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 in rescuing them out of Egypt, slavery to Egypt.

220
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,120
 And so the population of Jerusalem at Passover

221
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,840
 would swell to like 250,000 people.

222
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,240
 So it's kind of like awaken.

223
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,600
 You had people from all over the Roman Empire

224
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,560
 coming to one city to meet with God.

225
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,000
 So just imagine there's 250,000 people,

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,260
 they're coming from everywhere and what are they doing?

227
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,280
 They are coming to the temple.

228
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
 They are coming to the house of God,

229
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,660
 the place where the presence of God is said to reside.

230
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,520
 The place that is referred to

231
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,160
 as a house of prayer for all nations.

232
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,920
 And so the expectation is that all these hundreds

233
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,960
 of thousands of people are going to come

234
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,720
 and experience a spiritual high.

235
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,240
 It's like awaken, all the young adults in Israel

236
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,480
 are gonna leave saying, oh, I was wrecked.

237
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,960
 Like God wrecked me in the best of ways.

238
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,960
 And it's just like this moment in their trajectory

239
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,480
 with God where they're saying, that was it.

240
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,640
 That was the moment I was just weeping

241
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,820
 and the spirit of God met me and I'm never gonna sin again.

242
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,480
 Like that's what you expect as these hundreds of thousands

243
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,080
 of people come to Passover to worship.

244
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,720
 But here's what it says in verse 14.

245
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,880
 It says, "In the temple, he," that's Jesus,

246
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,280
 "he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons

247
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,920
 "and the money changers sitting there."

248
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,480
 Now, let me tell you what's going on here, okay?

249
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,000
 In the temple, there's people who are selling animals.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,360
 Why are they selling animals?

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
 They're selling animals because when people

252
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,000
 come to the temple at Passover,

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,800
 they come planning to sacrifice an animal

254
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
 as an act of worship to God.

255
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,560
 And so the reason that there were people selling

256
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,560
 pigeons or lambs was so that people didn't have to drag

257
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,360
 their lamb across the Roman Empire to the temple.

258
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,520
 They didn't have to like carry their pigeons

259
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,240
 all the way across a country just to get to Jerusalem.

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,680
 No, they could come and it was already there.

261
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,360
 And the reason that there were money changers

262
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,360
 is because every Jewish male 20 years or older

263
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,740
 was required to offer a temple tax.

264
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,880
 And it had to be one specific currency.

265
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,360
 But there were people coming from all over

266
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,700
 the Roman Empire, so there were different currencies.

267
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,440
 And so they would have money changers there

268
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,760
 just to help people and make it easier for people

269
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,280
 to get the right currency to make their payment.

270
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,960
 Jesus isn't happy about it.

271
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,920
 Here's what it says in verses 15 and 16.

272
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 It says, "And making a whip of cords."

273
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,200
 I find that hilarious.

274
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,080
 Like, Jesus just makes an impromptu whip.

275
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,520
 Like, I don't know if you've ever been in that moment

276
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,000
 where you're like, "You know what I need right now?

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 "I need a whip."

278
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,960
 (imitates whip)

279
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,040
 Just wait till I'm done making my whip.

280
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,400
 Like, you'll just see what happens.

281
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,280
 Like, it's fascinating to me that he's like,

282
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,120
 "You know what?

283
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,280
 "I don't have a whip, but I can make a whip."

284
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,060
 And he does.

285
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,240
 And what does he do with the whip?

286
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,880
 It says, "He drove them all out of the temple

287
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,640
 "with the sheep and oxen, and he poured out the coins

288
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,260
 "of the money changers and overturned their tables.

289
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,180
 "And he told those who sold the pigeons,

290
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,320
 "Take these things away.

291
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,000
 "Do not make my Father's house a house of trade."

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,520
 Why is Jesus so upset?

293
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,680
 Is it because of what they're doing?

294
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
 Selling animals?

295
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,240
 Changing currency?

296
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
 No.

297
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,320
 Those were okay things.

298
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,400
 It was okay for them to think about

299
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,920
 how to make sacrificing animals to God easier on people.

300
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,560
 It was okay for them to think about changing money

301
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,560
 to make it more convenient for people.

302
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,720
 The issue wasn't what they were doing.

303
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,200
 The issue is where they were doing it.

304
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,360
 They were doing it in the middle of the house of God,

305
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,000
 which was to be the place where people

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,280
 were to come and meet with God.

307
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,080
 Let me ask you, show of hands,

308
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,520
 anyone here ever had their quiet time

309
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,860
 at a Walmart on Good Friday?

310
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,920
 No?

311
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,400
 Why not?

312
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,560
 Anyone ever done it at a petting zoo,

313
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,320
 like just pulled out your Bible and met with God

314
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,520
 in the middle of a petting zoo?

315
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,800
 I wonder why.

316
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,160
 'Cause it's not the most conducive place to meet with God.

317
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,560
 D.A. Carson,

318
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,240
 scholar who wrote the leading commentary

319
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,080
 on the Gospel of John says this.

320
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,840
 He said, "Instead of solemn dignity

321
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,120
 "in the murmur of prayer,

322
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,640
 "there is the bellowing of cattle and the bleeding of sheep.

323
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,320
 "Instead of brokenness, incantation,

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,600
 "holy adoration, and prolonged petition,

325
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,320
 "there is noisy commerce."

326
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,680
 Do you see what the priority was?

327
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
 Among the leaders in the temple,

328
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,360
 the priority was on convenience and attendance.

329
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,320
 That's what the priority was on.

330
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,900
 The priority was on convenience.

331
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,120
 Let's just make it as easy as possible

332
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,200
 for people to get here and do what they need to do for God.

333
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
 And the priority was on attendance.

334
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,520
 At least they're here.

335
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,360
 Let's just get them here.

336
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,080
 But the priority was not on God's presence.

337
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,720
 In fact, the presence of God at this point

338
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
 in Israel's history,

339
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,960
 the presence of God had departed from the temple

340
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,680
 and it was just business as usual.

341
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,760
 And that's deeply concerning.

342
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,400
 May that never be true of our churches,

343
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,480
 that the presence of God has departed

344
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,360
 and it's just business as usual on a Sunday.

345
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,400
 So what does Jesus do?

346
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,240
 He cleans house.

347
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,760
 He gets rid of everything that doesn't belong,

348
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,240
 everything that would hinder or distract worshipers

349
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,840
 from truly worshiping.

350
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,660
 Now, remember where we started.

351
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,260
 Remember what the truth was where we started.

352
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,600
 We said Jesus cares deeply about the temple

353
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,940
 and so should we.

354
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,440
 So if you're tracking along,

355
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,840
 then it would be okay for you to be thinking right now,

356
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,040
 okay, I understand that Jesus cares deeply

357
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,880
 about the temple.

358
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,340
 That's why he drove all the sheep and pigeons out,

359
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,340
 but I still don't understand what it looks like for me

360
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,760
 to care about the temple.

361
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,360
 Okay, well, keep tracking with me.

362
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,440
 'Cause Jesus now has a conversation

363
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,840
 which is going to draw the relevance

364
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,760
 of this passage closer for us.

365
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,840
 Verse 18.

366
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,960
 It says, "So the Jews said to him,

367
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,960
 "what sign do you show us for doing these things?"

368
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,920
 What sign do you show us for doing these things?

369
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,240
 It's interesting that they don't say, how dare you?

370
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,680
 They say, hey, who told you

371
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,120
 that you have the authority to do this?

372
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,400
 Because they might be realizing

373
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,440
 that they're doing something that they shouldn't be doing.

374
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,740
 So they're not saying, how dare you?

375
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,200
 They're saying, hey, who are you?

376
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,400
 And do you have the authority to be doing what you're doing?

377
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
 Here's how Jesus answered them.

378
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,160
 He said, "Destroy this temple,

379
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,520
 "and in three days, I will raise it up."

380
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,740
 The Jews then said, "It's taken 46 years

381
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,440
 "to build this temple, and will you raise it up

382
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,280
 "in three days?"

383
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,280
 But he, Jesus, was speaking about the temple of his body.

384
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,940
 "When therefore he was raised from the dead,

385
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,020
 "his disciples remembered that he had said this,

386
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,160
 "and they believed the scripture

387
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,040
 "and the word that Jesus had spoken."

388
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,160
 So this interaction that Jesus has is very eye-opening,

389
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,240
 because what Jesus is trying to declare to the Jews

390
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,240
 is the temple is transitioning from a building to a body.

391
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,480
 And the Jews don't get it.

392
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
 They still think that he's talking

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
 about a physical structure, the building,

394
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,840
 but Jesus is talking about his body

395
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,080
 is now the temple of God.

396
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,080
 And Jesus references his death, burial, and resurrection.

397
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,720
 "Destroy this body, that will be Jesus hanging on the cross,

398
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,440
 "and it will be raised in three days."

399
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,320
 That's a reference to his resurrection.

400
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,120
 The reason that that is so important

401
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,060
 is because the imagery makes a deep connection.

402
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,880
 See, the physical temple, the building,

403
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,420
 was the place where once a year,

404
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,000
 a high priest would enter a very special room

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,200
 inside of the temple known as the Holy of Holies.

406
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,560
 Only that one person was allowed

407
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,760
 to enter that room one time a year,

408
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,720
 and he would wear a rope around his ankles

409
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,000
 in case he died in the presence of God.

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,680
 People could pull him out

411
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,080
 without having to go in after him.

412
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
 Once a year, that person, the high priest,

413
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,600
 would enter the Holy of Holies

414
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,160
 and sprinkle the blood of an animal on the altar

415
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,960
 to make atonement for the sins of Israel.

416
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,760
 Jesus says, "My body is the temple."

417
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,160
 It's no longer the blood of an animal

418
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,040
 that makes atonement for the sins of Israel.

419
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,840
 It will be my blood,

420
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,160
 which makes provision for the sins of the world.

421
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,440
 It's no longer a high priest, once a year,

422
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,520
 doing something to make the nation of Israel right with God.

423
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,160
 It is me, Jesus, doing something once and for all

424
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,680
 that will make right all those

425
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,280
 who have put their faith in me with God.

426
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,240
 Jesus says the temple has transitioned

427
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,680
 from a building to a body.

428
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,160
 Now, if you're tracking along,

429
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,240
 again, the question you should be asking is,

430
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,840
 okay, Jesus cares deeply about the temple,

431
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,880
 in TA, that's what people call me.

432
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,640
 You're telling me I should care deeply about the temple.

433
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,560
 I now understand that the temple

434
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,800
 is not a building but a body,

435
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,640
 but Jesus Christ, after he rose from the dead,

436
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,840
 he ascended into heaven,

437
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,040
 where he's now seated at the right hand of the Father.

438
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,560
 So he's no longer even on earth.

439
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,520
 So what does it look like for me to value the temple?

440
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,080
 Here it is.

441
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,520
 First Corinthians chapter three, verse 16.

442
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,040
 Listen to what it says.

443
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:45,320
 Or do you not know that you are God's temple

444
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:52,440
 in that God's spirit dwells in you?

445
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,360
 If anyone destroys God's temple,

446
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,360
 God will destroy him for God's temple is holy

447
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,160
 and you are that temple.

448
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,280
 So now we're making a connection

449
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,400
 because the temple went from a building

450
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,680
 to the body of Jesus,

451
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,640
 but then Jesus Christ rose from the dead

452
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
 and ascended into heaven, ascended into heaven,

453
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 and then Jesus Christ sent his spirit to the earth

454
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,400
 and the spirit of God now takes up residence

455
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,720
 in the people of God.

456
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 And what's interesting is that when Paul says,

457
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,840
 you are the temple of God,

458
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,540
 that word you in the Greek is in the plural.

459
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,120
 So this is a reference to the people of God,

460
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,200
 the universal church,

461
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,500
 anyone who would consider themselves

462
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,440
 a follower of Jesus Christ,

463
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,160
 we collectively, the people of God,

464
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,720
 are now the temple of God.

465
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,840
 We, the people of God,

466
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,480
 are the way that God declares, I'm here.

467
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,200
 And the greatest way that the temple of God

468
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,400
 is manifested on the earth today

469
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,200
 is through local expressions, local churches.

470
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,800
 That's why it's so important

471
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,840
 for you to be connected to a local church

472
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,680
 wherever you live,

473
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,800
 because that is the greatest expression

474
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
 of the temple of God.

475
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,480
 The temple of God is how God now declares on the earth,

476
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,600
 I'm here.

477
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,680
 So now the question that is good for us to answer

478
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,480
 is like if Jesus were to step in to awaken right now,

479
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,560
 or if he were to step into your church

480
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,000
 on a Sunday morning,

481
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 would Jesus step in and look at what we're doing?

482
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,480
 Would he look at how we're worshiping?

483
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,280
 Would he look at how we're studying the word?

484
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,800
 Not just here at Awaken,

485
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,040
 but wherever you find a place to worship,

486
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,840
 would Jesus step into that moment and be like,

487
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,920
 that's what I'm talking about.

488
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,160
 Like when I thought about my people gathering to worship,

489
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,000
 like this is what I envision.

490
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,400
 Or would he see things

491
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,560
 that he would want to drive out?

492
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,120
 Like are there things in our churches,

493
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,800
 are there things even here at Awaken, I don't know,

494
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,320
 that have kind of found themselves

495
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,480
 on the bookshelves of our churches

496
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,920
 and have made themselves at home?

497
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,440
 See, we have to understand the reason

498
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,720
 that we should care deeply about the temple

499
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,280
 is because we are the temple collectively.

500
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,200
 We are.

501
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,880
 We are the temple of God collectively.

502
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,400
 That's who we are.

503
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,120
 So it's just good for us to evaluate,

504
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,040
 is there anything that Jesus would want to drive out?

505
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,560
 I just want to identify some things

506
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,240
 that I see going on in the church today

507
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
 that we just need to be careful of

508
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,000
 because if we aren't careful,

509
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,320
 you know what we are going to do?

510
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,880
 We are going to prioritize what the leaders in the temple

511
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,760
 in the first century prioritized.

512
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,640
 Like if we're not careful,

513
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,080
 we will have a tendency to prioritize convenience

514
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,440
 over God's presence.

515
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,320
 Do you ever feel that when you go to worship?

516
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,560
 Do you ever prioritize convenience?

517
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,040
 Like I see this, I used to work with college students

518
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,760
 at A&M and I would see this tendency towards,

519
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,240
 you know what, I'll go to church when I can go,

520
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
 but you know what, I'm super busy.

521
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
 And you know what, I had a late Saturday night

522
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,080
 and I need to get a jump on my work for the week.

523
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 And so I will get more serious about gathering

524
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,000
 with God's people at a later time,

525
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,160
 but right now I'll just, I'll go when I can go.

526
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,120
 So I don't know if that connects with you at all,

527
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,560
 but there can be this tendency of, you know what,

528
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,880
 I'll go when I'm in town and I'll go when I can,

529
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,520
 but you know what, if I can't go,

530
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,400
 here's the thing that I'm most worried about

531
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,040
 for the next generation.

532
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,040
 It is the belief that live streaming or podcasting

533
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,400
 is a great substitute for gathering with God's people.

534
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,800
 And I'm just telling you,

535
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,520
 we collectively are the temple of God.

536
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,760
 It is us gathering together,

537
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 that when we gather together, God is declaring, I am here.

538
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,560
 When you are in your apartment alone or in your car

539
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,440
 podcasting at double speed, that that is a disconnect.

540
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,920
 It's a disconnect.

541
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,800
 The priority there is on, it's on convenience.

542
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,520
 It's not on God's presence.

543
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,520
 Or like this, you know,

544
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,280
 people are talking about Generation Z's attention span.

545
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
 It's like a big topic of conversation

546
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,960
 that Generation Z's attention span is down to eight seconds,

547
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,040
 which is shorter than a goldfish.

548
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,840
 And so what's the responsibility of the church?

549
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,680
 Well, we need to, we need to make everything shorter.

550
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,600
 We need to have shorter services and shorter worship sets

551
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,960
 and shorter sermons.

552
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,800
 Why?

553
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,040
 So we don't lose people's attention.

554
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,440
 And I'm like, what are we doing here?

555
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,880
 It's all about convenience.

556
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,760
 It's all about us making things as palatable as possible.

557
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,880
 Or there's this movement towards

558
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,320
 just making the Bible simpler

559
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,360
 because biblical illiteracy is at an all time high.

560
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,800
 People don't know their Bibles.

561
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,920
 And so you know what is happening

562
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,040
 is pastors are giving people less Bible

563
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,880
 because they don't think that they can handle it.

564
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,920
 And so what you see pastors doing,

565
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,080
 and this is not me railing against pastors.

566
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,960
 This is me saying, hey, if you are a pastor,

567
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,800
 hey, we've got to hold the line.

568
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,640
 Because there's this tendency,

569
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,520
 and I can slip into it as well, where it's like,

570
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,600
 okay, let's just give people one verse.

571
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,560
 Like let's read the Bible for 30 seconds

572
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,080
 and then let's hold a pep rally for 10 to 15 minutes

573
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,240
 where I will just tell you my opinions

574
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,320
 and get you hyped up on Jesus for the next 15 minutes.

575
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,280
 But that's really just me saying,

576
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,280
 hey, you're great and go do good things and God loves you.

577
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,360
 And what is happening is that people's spiritual stomachs

578
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,880
 are shrinking down to the point

579
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,600
 where they can only handle spiritual milk

580
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,600
 when the word of God is like a, it's an incredible filet.

581
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,640
 And if you're a vegetarian,

582
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,920
 that doesn't connect with you at all.

583
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,360
 And I apologize deeply,

584
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,260
 but it's time to get back on the meat.

585
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:52,140
 But do you see what I'm talking about?

586
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,260
 There's a priority on convenience over God's presence.

587
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,240
 And hey, that's not me trying to condemn.

588
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
 That's just me saying, look, I see where we're headed.

589
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,200
 And if we're not careful,

590
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,600
 we're gonna prioritize the things

591
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,500
 that were prioritized in the first century.

592
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,880
 Our tendency will be to prioritize attendance

593
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,080
 over God's presence.

594
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,880
 Like I'll tell you the temptation for me as a leader.

595
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,360
 My tendency can be to look at this room.

596
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,360
 I mean, if you look around, there's 3,500 plus people in here

597
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,960
 I can snap a picture of this and show it to people

598
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,120
 and be like, you wanna see what happened at Awaken?

599
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,560
 Here's it, this is it.

600
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,440
 But attendance only tells you how many people in the room.

601
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,200
 It doesn't tell you if the spirit of God moved or not.

602
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,760
 And so ministry leaders, we have to be careful

603
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,760
 not to celebrate big numbers when there's little movement.

604
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,360
 And so I just tell you that to say that that is a disconnect

605
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,720
 that if we aren't careful, we'll be prioritizing

606
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,200
 the same thing that was prioritized in the first century.

607
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,240
 But then we have to make sure

608
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,320
 that we don't just prioritize attendance over God's presence

609
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,760
 that it's like, you know what?

610
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,440
 When you show up to worship, you're kind of flying in high,

611
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
 you're already 10 to 15 minutes late,

612
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,480
 but you haven't had your coffee yet.

613
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,640
 And so worship's going on,

614
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,040
 but it's like, I gotta get my coffee.

615
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,960
 And then you get in, you sit down,

616
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,240
 you start texting your friends

617
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,600
 to find out where they're sitting.

618
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,620
 And then there's like a song left.

619
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,240
 And so then you just go on autopilot worship

620
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,920
 where you're singing all the words,

621
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,360
 but your mind is somewhere else.

622
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,600
 It's like, way maker, okay, I need to text him back.

623
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
 Miracle worker, oh my gosh,

624
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,800
 Cain's is gonna sound so good after church today.

625
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,080
 Promise, and it's like you're autopilot worship.

626
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,840
 But our tendency is to just, you know what?

627
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,040
 At least I was there.

628
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,800
 But if you look at this story, you know what we see?

629
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,720
 We see that Jesus despises attendance without worship.

630
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,560
 Like God doesn't sit in him and say,

631
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,900
 but at least they're there.

632
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,440
 They don't give a rip about being there,

633
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,040
 but at least they're in the building.

634
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,960
 No, that's not what is pleasing to him.

635
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,880
 And then I'll just give you a third thing

636
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,680
 that we can tend to prioritize

637
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,680
 is preference over God's presence.

638
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,080
 Like I see this, I saw this with college students.

639
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,400
 There was this tendency to shop and hop

640
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,200
 when it came to church.

641
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,160
 And if you find one thing that you don't like, you leave.

642
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,320
 And then there's this movement now

643
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,400
 to make celebrities out of pastors and worship leaders

644
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,240
 to where we get to the point that we only really like

645
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
 learning from certain people.

646
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,360
 Like I remember one guy saying,

647
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,960
 "Nobody speaks to me like this one person."

648
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,040
 And I was like, man, I hate that for you.

649
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,240
 I hate that for you.

650
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:53,560
 Because now your mind and heart are only truly fully open

651
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
 to receive from the word of God

652
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,960
 when this one person is speaking.

653
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,040
 But God has called countless people

654
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,160
 to teach the word of God.

655
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,280
 And every single one of us is called to open up this word

656
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,000
 in any time it's taught, to listen and receive

657
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,480
 as if God is speaking to us.

658
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,440
 And this is a tough conversation.

659
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,680
 Like I don't wanna be the get off my lawn guy.

660
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,640
 Like I don't feel like I'm at that point in my life yet.

661
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,840
 I know I'm older than you, but I'm only 41.

662
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,280
 Like I don't feel like, so if it feels like that,

663
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,920
 I apologize, but I just, this is me just in my love

664
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,360
 for the church and for you wanting to say,

665
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,640
 hey, please, let's guard against this.

666
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,400
 I see this tendency towards critiquing

667
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
 instead of worshiping.

668
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
 Like be careful.

669
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,800
 Do you ever leave church and ask the question,

670
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,360
 what did you think?

671
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,560
 That's a critiquing question.

672
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,640
 The only answer is either you liked it or you didn't.

673
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,160
 It's the wrong question to ask.

674
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,600
 The right question to ask is,

675
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,400
 hey, what did God say to you today?

676
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,440
 Like if God is there, if God is here,

677
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,040
 then what is he saying to you?

678
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,280
 So here's my point.

679
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,880
 The reason that we should care about the temple

680
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,600
 is that we are the temple collectively

681
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,080
 when we gather together, we can confidently declare

682
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,560
 God is, he's here.

683
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,560
 Can you imagine, like if you want to be a change agent,

684
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,360
 if you want to be a change agent,

685
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,120
 then when you go home, go to your local church,

686
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,920
 and when you walk into that place,

687
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,560
 you walk in with the conviction,

688
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,160
 God is here and I'm going to meet with him.

689
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,000
 And just watch how things begin to change.

690
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,480
 Like if a group of you gets together

691
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,960
 and you go into your church and you believe God is here

692
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,280
 and we are going to meet with him,

693
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,560
 just watch how things will change.

694
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,720
 It will be infectious, it will be contagious.

695
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,080
 You will begin to see people find healing

696
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,960
 from brokenness that comes from sin.

697
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,400
 You will see people feel called

698
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,520
 to take the gospel to the nations.

699
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,440
 You will see people finally begin to enjoy

700
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,000
 relating to Jesus.

701
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,520
 You will see people serving the church wholeheartedly

702
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,040
 with their time, with their talent, with their treasure.

703
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,000
 And it'll be a beautiful thing.

704
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,120
 We are the temple collectively,

705
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,560
 but we can't just stop there

706
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,720
 because here's what 1 Corinthians 6 says,

707
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,840
 and I hope you're ready to hear it.

708
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,440
 It says this, "Or do you not know that your body

709
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,800
 is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you,

710
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,840
 whom you have from God?

711
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,080
 You individually are not your own,

712
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,680
 for you are bought with a price.

713
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,400
 So glorify God in your body."

714
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,640
 Here's what that means.

715
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,880
 We're not just the temple collectively.

716
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,320
 You are the temple of God individually.

717
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,560
 Have you ever had that realization

718
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,840
 that when you put your trust in Jesus Christ,

719
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,880
 the Spirit of God actually comes and lives inside of you

720
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,760
 so that now you, your body, your soul is a home,

721
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,120
 it is a house for the living God?

722
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,520
 1 Corinthians 6, when it says, "Your body is a temple,"

723
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,080
 that word temple there, in the Greek,

724
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,200
 it means the sacred shrine, the sanctuary,

725
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,000
 the place where deity dwells.

726
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,840
 Is that how you think about your body?

727
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,640
 The place where deity dwells because that's what it is.

728
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
 It's the house of the living God.

729
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,440
 So the question that we need to answer individually is this.

730
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,960
 Like if Jesus were to spend the day with us,

731
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,720
 which he actually does every day, all day,

732
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,440
 but if we were aware of it,

733
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,760
 if he were to spend a day with us,

734
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,560
 is there anything that in your life or in my life

735
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,800
 that Jesus would look at and say,

736
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,160
 "Hey, look, this has nothing to do

737
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,280
 with my unconditional love for you."

738
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,200
 I love you, but there are things in your life

739
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,560
 that have made themselves at home in the house of God

740
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,080
 that no longer belong.

741
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,920
 Like is there anything in your life right now

742
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,440
 that Jesus would look at and say,

743
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,520
 "Look, you got a fishing license in your soul

744
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,360
 that it doesn't make sense anymore.

745
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,000
 It doesn't fit."

746
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,440
 I'll explain it this way.

747
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,960
 There is a major difference between renting a home

748
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,000
 and owning a home, and we've done both.

749
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,480
 Right now, we're renting.

750
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,280
 And the deal with renting is that you get to live there,

751
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,160
 but you have no freedom or authority

752
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,880
 to do what you want with the house.

753
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,840
 So right now, we're living in a home

754
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,720
 where the floor plan is what it is.

755
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,360
 The wallpaper on the walls, it is what it is.

756
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,200
 The paint color, it is what it is.

757
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,760
 We've done the best we can with the place that isn't,

758
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,800
 it isn't ours.

759
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,600
 But then I know what it's like to own a home.

760
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,480
 And my wife has watched enough HGTV

761
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,680
 that she knows exactly how to make that home her own.

762
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,480
 And we're about to move into a house

763
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
 in less than a month that we're gonna own it.

764
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,520
 And my wife has been going over to that house

765
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,640
 constantly, measuring stuff, checking stuff out,

766
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,720
 because she knows exactly what she's going to do

767
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,440
 in the house that she will have complete freedom

768
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,560
 and complete authority to do with it what she wants.

769
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,280
 So there's a big difference between renting and owning.

770
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,520
 If our life, if our body is a house of God,

771
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,880
 here's the question.

772
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,640
 Are you expecting the Spirit of God

773
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,880
 to rent or own in your life?

774
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,400
 Are you realizing, hey, Spirit of God,

775
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,200
 yes, you live in me, but I don't want you jacking things up.

776
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,400
 Like, yes, I love that you have saved me, God.

777
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,040
 I love that you live inside of me,

778
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,840
 but stay out of the room of my romantic relationships.

779
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,960
 Because I don't exactly trust you

780
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,120
 to provide the right guy or the right girl.

781
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,760
 So let me deal with that.

782
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,600
 Or God, you know what?

783
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,640
 Stay out of the room of how I spend my money.

784
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,120
 I know I'm living like a $30,000 millionaire,

785
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,960
 but this is my mid-20s,

786
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,680
 and I'll figure it out later in life.

787
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,400
 Or God, stay out of the room of my work.

788
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,440
 I just want to do the bare minimum and get in and get out.

789
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,320
 Stay out of the room of what I'm doing on the weekends

790
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,440
 or when I go to happy hour.

791
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,640
 You can rent, but you can't own.

792
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,040
 When we were moving from College Station to Dallas,

793
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,040
 the night before the morning,

794
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,680
 when the movers were coming

795
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,440
 to take all of our stuff away to Dallas,

796
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,280
 like this was our last night in the house.

797
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,560
 We had already signed papers

798
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,120
 that the house was going to the next owner.

799
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,320
 And that night, one of my kids was half asleep.

800
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,280
 He came out and he knocked one of the side tables

801
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,720
 of the couch, and there was a full glass of water on it.

802
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,280
 He knocked it off, and it fell on the ground,

803
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,680
 and nobody knew it for hours.

804
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,360
 And so that water sat on our wood floor

805
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,040
 for the entire night, to the point

806
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,600
 that when I finally cleaned it up,

807
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,160
 the wood floor had already begun to bubble up,

808
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,240
 which is problematic

809
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,760
 when it's no longer your house.

810
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,560
 And I remember waking up and panicking

811
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,520
 that this isn't my house anymore.

812
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,120
 It doesn't belong to me, so it matters.

813
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,280
 It matters what I do with this house

814
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,160
 because this no longer is my house.

815
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,160
 And I just, I wonder if some of us are missing

816
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,360
 that same conviction of this is no longer my house.

817
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,200
 It matters what I do with this house

818
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,400
 because this house is no longer my house.

819
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,240
 This is the house of God.

820
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,600
 And so here's what I'm just asking you to do.

821
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,240
 Jesus valued the temple, cared deeply about the temple,

822
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,280
 and so should we.

823
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,320
 I'm asking you to just think,

824
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,400
 are you asking Jesus to rent or own in your life?

825
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,560
 Because when you ask Jesus to own,

826
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,720
 it changes everything.

827
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,200
 You begin to think, Jesus, is this what you want

828
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,400
 your eyes looking at right now on my phone

829
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,800
 or on the computer screen?

830
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,320
 Jesus, are these the words that you want coming out

831
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,040
 of my mouth when I'm talking to these people?

832
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,560
 Jesus, is this what you want your body doing in this moment?

833
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,240
 Jesus, is this how you want your body

834
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,760
 to be working at this job?

835
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,880
 It just changes.

836
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
 It's no longer yours.

837
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,040
 It's his.

838
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,200
 And so I'll just, I'll tell you this.

839
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,280
 You know, when, what was the temple for?

840
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,120
 The temple was a place to worship.

841
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,480
 Here at Watermark, after every service,

842
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,520
 at the end of every service,

843
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
 we say have a great week of worship.

844
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,880
 And what we're not saying is,

845
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,280
 hey, go out and sing songs the entire week.

846
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,760
 What we're saying is, hey, when you begin to believe

847
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,920
 that Jesus owns, when the Spirit of God owns,

848
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
 you know what the overflow of your life is?

849
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,560
 Worship.

850
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,400
 It's worship.

851
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,000
 And so I just want you to hear me say this.

852
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,480
 You're either going to spend your time fighting

853
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,240
 with the Spirit of God or surrendering to the Spirit of God.

854
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,160
 But surrender is the shortest path to a godly life.

855
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,360
 It's the shortest path.

856
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,280
 Surrender is.

857
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,160
 So I just want to ask you to think for a second,

858
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,920
 who's the godliest person that you know?

859
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,120
 Just think about that real quick.

860
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,240
 Can you, you've got their face in your mind.

861
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,000
 Who is the godliest person that you know?

862
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,600
 Who is it?

863
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,920
 The reason that they are the way they are

864
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,680
 is because at some point in their life,

865
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
 they made a decision.

866
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,040
 The Spirit of God will not rent.

867
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,200
 The Spirit of God will own.

868
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,520
 And then every day since then,

869
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
 they've woken up with the same conviction.

870
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,160
 And my encouragement is for you to do the same.

871
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,000
 So what do we do with a talk like this?

872
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,800
 Like where do we go with a talk like this?

873
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,840
 Well, let me just encourage you to do two things.

874
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,240
 Here's the first thing that I want to encourage you to do.

875
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,760
 When you leave Awakened, when you go home,

876
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,160
 and you begin to go to your church,

877
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,760
 your local church on Sundays,

878
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,960
 when you go to your Porch Live locations

879
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,120
 on whatever night that you guys meet,

880
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,400
 then let me encourage you,

881
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,880
 when you show up, you walk into that building

882
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,600
 with the conviction, God is here,

883
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,920
 and I am going to meet with Him.

884
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,560
 Like you reject autopilot worship.

885
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,240
 You don't fly in hot 10 to 15 minutes late

886
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,000
 every single week, prioritizing just attendance.

887
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,560
 No, God is here and I get to meet with Him.

888
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,720
 The second thing that I want to encourage you to do

889
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,560
 is every morning this next week,

890
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,360
 when you wake up, get on your knees

891
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,440
 and open up your hands and just say,

892
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,480
 God, you own.

893
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,840
 You own my mind, you own my heart,

894
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,760
 you own my feelings, you own my body.

895
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,960
 Everything in my life belongs to you.

896
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,360
 I want to live fully surrendered to you.

897
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,680
 There are no rooms in the house of my life

898
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,080
 that are off limits to you.

899
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,560
 You can redecorate however you want

900
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,880
 because I belong to you.

901
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,240
 But as you do those things, don't forget this.

902
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,480
 All eyes on me, don't forget this.

903
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,360
 In the end, it was Jesus that cleansed the temple.

904
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,000
 And that wasn't just an act of judgment,

905
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,560
 that was actually an act of mercy

906
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,760
 because Jesus Christ was making the temple

907
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,080
 a place again where people could meet with God.

908
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,120
 Here's what you need to understand.

909
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,760
 When Jesus Christ went to the cross

910
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,240
 and died for your sins and mine

911
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,720
 and then rose from the dead,

912
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,200
 you know what He was doing?

913
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,840
 He was cleansing your temple.

914
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,480
 When you put your faith in Him,

915
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,360
 He made you clean so that the Spirit of God

916
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,520
 could live inside of you so that you could meet with Him.

917
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,520
 This is what He does, this is His kindness to us.

918
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,680
 I don't come here today to beat you over the head,

919
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,000
 say, "You gotta get rid of some stuff in your life."

920
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,720
 I'm here to just say, "Hey, we have a good King

921
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,440
 "and He loves us and it is His joy to cleanse us.

922
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,440
 "He made us right with Him."

923
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,320
 And if you don't know Jesus today,

924
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,840
 like if you came into this place

925
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,240
 and you know about Jesus but you don't know Jesus,

926
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,960
 the one who went to the cross,

927
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,360
 who died for all of your sins,

928
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,400
 who on the third day rose from the dead

929
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,400
 so that when you put your faith in Him,

930
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,640
 He would make you clean and live in you

931
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,160
 and with you for all of eternity,

932
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,200
 that's who He is and that's what He's come to do.

933
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,760
 I'll end by saying this.

934
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,040
 The theme for the weekend is the rehearsal.

935
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,400
 Why is it called the rehearsal?

936
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,840
 Because we wanna rehearse here

937
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,400
 what we will be doing for all of eternity.

938
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,360
 So what does the temple have to do with the rehearsal?

939
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,040
 Well, we started and said that in Genesis,

940
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:12,280
 the Garden of Eden, the garden was the first temple of God

941
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,320
 and in the temple, the garden temple,

942
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,200
 God was declaring, "I'm here,"

943
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,480
 as He walked with Adam and Eve.

944
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,880
 In the tabernacle and in the temple of the Old Testament,

945
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,640
 the Israelites, they made a structure

946
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,160
 and the presence of God filled that structure

947
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,880
 as a declaration, "I am here."

948
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,120
 Jesus Christ left heaven and came to earth

949
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,160
 and He dwelt among men as a declaration

950
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,240
 from heaven to earth, "I am here."

951
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,800
 Jesus Christ ascended into heaven and sent His Spirit

952
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,680
 and His Spirit now fills the people of God collectively

953
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,120
 and when we gather, God is declaring, "I am here."

954
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,440
 And the Spirit of God, when you put faith in Jesus Christ,

955
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,040
 the Spirit of God comes and lives inside of you

956
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,960
 and every single day, the Spirit of God

957
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,560
 is declaring to you, "I am here."

958
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,960
 But then you read Revelation 21,

959
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,680
 the new heavens and the new earth and here's what it says.

960
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,080
 It says, "And I heard a loud voice from the throne

961
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,160
 saying, 'Behold the dwelling place.'"

962
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,240
 And in the Greek, that word dwelling place,

963
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,080
 it means tabernacle.

964
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,560
 The tabernacle, the temple of God is where?

965
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,720
 It is with man.

966
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,000
 He will dwell with them and they will be His people

967
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 and God Himself will be with them as their God.

968
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,440
 We will spend all of eternity in the temple of God

969
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,840
 and for all of eternity,

970
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:47,840
 God will declare to us, "I am here."

971
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,640
 So what does it look like for us to rehearse

972
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,360
 for eternity now?

973
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,240
 It looks like this.

974
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:01,160
 May the presence of God become precious to His people

975
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,520
 because God is here.

976
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,560
 Let's pray together.

977
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,440
 Lord Jesus, I thank You

978
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,440
 that even now You are here with us.

979
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,520
 I pray that we would have a sense, God,

980
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,320
 that You are here now and You are meeting with us.

981
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,160
 You've given us Your Spirit.

982
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,360
 I pray, Holy Spirit, that You'd be at work

983
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,920
 moving in every single one of our lives, Lord.

984
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,400
 God, we all have things on the bookshelves of our lives

985
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,020
 that have found a home that just don't belong.

986
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,440
 And so I pray that Your grace would be sufficient

987
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,800
 that no one would walk in shame today because of that,

988
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,560
 but that they would know You, Lord Jesus,

989
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,240
 the one who cleanses the temple.

990
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,680
 I pray, God, that even now You would identify things

991
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,260
 in our churches and in our lives individually

992
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,400
 that just don't belong.

993
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,760
 And may we experience Your grace in that,

994
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,080
 but may You help us take a step today, Lord.

995
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,240
 I pray that we would be a people that just declares,

996
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:17,500
 You own, You don't rent.

997
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,000
 You can do what You want with our lives.

998
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,220
 We need You.

999
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,580
 We love You.

1000
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,860
 In Jesus' name, amen.
