[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:21.860]   - All right, here we go.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.700]   - Here we are.
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.440]   - Corona porch edition week three.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.180]   We are continuing this series on Esther,
[00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.620]   God save the queen, how you doing man?
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.700]   - I'm doing pretty good.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.540]   - Yeah.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.740]   - I'm excited just to be here.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.580]   - Come on bro, I love it man.
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.020]   - Yeah, it's just nice to get out of the house.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.400]   - It is so nice to get out of the house, good grief man.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.900]   - Everyone's gotta stay away from me.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.740]   - Cabin fever.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.580]   Hey, so we're gonna wrap up the book of Esther tonight.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.420]   If you're just joining us,
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.060]   we'll give you a recap on everything that's been going on.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.140]   But let me ask a question.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.780]   What is your favorite board game?
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.780]   - Ooh, recently it's been,
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.460]   have you ever heard of secret Hitler?
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.740]   - Oh, I totally have heard of secret Hitler.
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.900]   - Yeah, if y'all have not seen secret Hitler,
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.220]   I would highly recommend it.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.140]   - Which sounds like a much worse game than it actually is.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it actually does.
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.020]   - Yeah, totally.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.820]   - It's really weird, but such a fun game.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.820]   Watermark favorite too.
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.800]   - It's a total Watermark favorite,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.020]   which is gonna confuse people,
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.720]   but it is a great game.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.780]   Risk would be up there, there's several games.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.300]   In my house right now though, with little kids,
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.020]   we are reintroducing all types of games
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.060]   that are like from my childhood,
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.780]   in order to stop all the Disney watching that's taking place.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.500]   So we're playing Guess Who, do you remember Guess Who?
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.340]   - Oh yeah.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.260]   - You have to flip it open, you have to, yeah,
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.580]   flip them down if they're not the person.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.100]   We're playing Hungry Hungry Hippos.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.740]   - Oh, loud game. - My son.
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.380]   Oh, totally loud game, he's all about it.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.980]   And I played a new game for the first time this week
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.860]   called Scattergories, you heard of Scattergories?
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.700]   - I don't think so.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.060]   - Scattergories is like, if you're a millennial or younger,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.400]   you probably have no idea what that game is,
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.380]   but my wife loves that game.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.740]   She was like, we're playing this,
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.260]   and was trying to be a supportive husband,
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.140]   and so kids went down, we played Scattergories.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.500]   Never played the game before, and I'm like, how do you play?
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.940]   And she was like, oh, you'll figure it out.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.540]   And her mind is like really self-explanatory,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.700]   which works at some level, but then there's different rules
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.300]   that are a part of it, so we started playing,
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.180]   and because I didn't know the rules,
[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.060]   it was like every time I would try to do something,
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.660]   so the way it kind of high-level works is,
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.420]   and I'm gonna get blown up in the comments, I bet, on this,
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.460]   by people being like, you don't know how to play Scattergories
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.380]   is you'll roll the dice, and it'll have letters on the dice.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.380]   So it's like a 26 edge die, or some level of edge.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.500]   You roll it, and it's like a G, and then you pick a card,
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.540]   and on that card, it'll have 12 different categories
[00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.140]   of things where you have to write a favorite boy name
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.140]   that starts with a G, favorite music band, type of food,
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.620]   continent, or country, or just these different things.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.700]   And so we're playing the game,
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.260]   and there'll be different things where she'd be like,
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.540]   no, you can't write the same name twice.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.540]   So if you wrote down Garth Brooks for favorite musician,
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.940]   and then you wrote Garth for favorite boy's name
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.660]   that starts with a G, doesn't count.
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.220]   Or if you had two letters, two words that started
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.620]   with the same letter, and you're on S,
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.140]   and you have SpongeBob SquarePants, that'd be two S,
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.380]   so you get double points on that.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.860]   So it'd be like, what, you're cheating.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.900]   And it was because she didn't ever explain the rules.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.820]   I didn't know exactly how to win the game,
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.420]   all that was involved, what would count against you,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.140]   because if you don't know the game to a board,
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.740]   or how to play the rules, excuse me,
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.900]   if you don't know the rules to a game,
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.300]   you can't win the game.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.140]   What does it have to do
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.420]   with what we're talking about tonight?
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.420]   - Well, as it relates to the game of life,
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.460]   what we talk about all the time with young adults
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.900]   is there are a lot of people,
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.980]   everyone is playing the game of life,
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.980]   but a lot of people don't know the rules,
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.380]   they don't know what it means to actually have a success,
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.220]   or to win, what failure looks like.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.340]   And so just like in any board game,
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.940]   if you don't know the rules, you can't win the game.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.500]   If you don't know the way life works,
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.820]   or really the rules, the objective of the game of life,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.980]   if you will, you will not be able to win.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.980]   And you may be thinking to yourself,
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.740]   no, I wanna know what success looks like, or thinks like.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.940]   And so wherever you are listening right now,
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.900]   I just want you to think about like,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.540]   what is a successful life to you look like?
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.700]   What are the objectives really of life?
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.460]   What would a failed life look like?
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.060]   And what would it look like to at the end of your days?
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.580]   I mean, 'cause there's nothing,
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.300]   there are at least few things more tragic,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.260]   maybe nothing more tragic,
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.100]   than to get to the end of your life,
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.700]   or to the end of your 20s,
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.300]   or to the end of your 30s, or 40s, or 50s,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.700]   and waste your life, or waste a decade,
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.020]   and not have played according to it.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.480]   So God, all throughout the scriptures,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.540]   gives us principles and truths
[00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.380]   that are a part of the rules of the game of life,
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.140]   if you will, 'cause he, as much as we ever will want to,
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.100]   wants us to experience success.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.900]   He wants us to live a life of purpose,
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.800]   and a life that is at the end of our days,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.380]   we look back and say, man, it wasn't a waste,
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.220]   and it wasn't a fail.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.420]   So tonight, we're gonna continue the book of Esther.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.820]   We're gonna look at three principles
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.380]   from the final four chapters.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.020]   So we're about to go through some Bible tonight,
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.760]   that will relate to what it looks like,
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.620]   some key things that are involved,
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.180]   anytime you're gonna succeed at the game of life.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.540]   So the book of Esther, for a recap,
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.340]   is a book that is about, it's named after Queen Esther.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.600]   Takes place 500 years before Jesus was around.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.100]   You know what country it's in, modern day country?
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.900]   - I don't wanna get it wrong.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.460]   - Yeah, we, it's in Iran, modern day Iran.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.320]   It was the Persian empire at that time.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.900]   Basically, what had happened 500 years
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.700]   before Jesus was around, so 500 BC, Persia,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.660]   which is a empire of ancient times,
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.200]   shows up, conquer the known world.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.300]   They took over everything.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.380]   They're led by a king named Xerxes.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.260]   He's one of the main characters in the story.
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.500]   I said, when I think about Xerxes,
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.260]   I think of Jake Gyllenhaal from the one movie
[00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.620]   that probably no one has ever seen.
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.300]   There he is, just looking fly.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.540]   Or he's King Xerxes, he rules over the land.
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.500]   He's powerful, he's wealthy, he's got the palace,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.220]   he's got the kingdom, he's got everything.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.080]   And he's not a believer in God,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.260]   but he ends up, week one, we covered,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.340]   holding a bachelor Persia, or a mixture
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.520]   between a bachelor and beauty competition
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.300]   and like sex competition to find
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.640]   who will be the next queen of Persia.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.740]   And Esther was ripped out of her house
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.860]   and she was declared, she won the competition.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.940]   So Esther, when I think of Esther,
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.020]   I think of Wonder Woman right here,
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.780]   'cause she's kind of the one woman in our story, Gal Gadot.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.300]   - Wow. - Fierce, man.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.140]   - So fierce.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.020]   - So that's character number two.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.820]   So you got King Xerxes, you got Esther,
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.620]   then you have Uncle Jesse Mordecais,
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.820]   who I think of Uncle Jesse, of course, the most famous.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.540]   And then our villain, Haman, which is Jafar,
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.300]   whether you like the cartoon version of Jafar,
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.720]   which I think they'll pop up there,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   or the real version of Jafar, there he is with Iago, man.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.500]   - Yeah. - Straight up Iago.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.300]   And those are the main characters.
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.220]   And so week one, we were introduced
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.320]   from this peasant girl, Esther,
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.540]   who all of a sudden goes from poverty to the palace.
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.580]   Then week two, we're introduced to the villain,
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.220]   where Haman set out a plot to kill all of the Jewish people,
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.380]   all the people of God.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.340]   He basically, because Mordecai wouldn't bow and worship him,
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.660]   he was like, "I'm not just gonna kill you,
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.580]   I wanna kill all the Jewish people."
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.300]   And because Haman was number two in charge,
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.700]   he was the prime minister,
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.560]   he had the ability to put in a decree
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.580]   that allowed that to happen.
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.820]   So we're told that all the Jewish people knew
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.780]   there was gonna come a day, March 7th,
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.300]   where they were gonna all be killed.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.740]   It was months ahead,
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.300]   and that they were gonna lose their lives.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.460]   And then last week, we dove in
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.220]   and just kind of looked at three more truths
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.900]   as it relates to fairy tale faith and talked about Disney.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.900]   So if week one was "Bachelor Persia,"
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.020]   and if week two was "Making a Murderer,"
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.260]   and if week three was Disney+, if you will,
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.440]   and what's involved in true faith,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.620]   this week will be "Silver Linings Playbook."
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.000]   That even when you can't see it, God is at work.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.800]   And even in the midst of all the craziness
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.380]   that has happened so far in this story,
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.200]   that looked chaotic, that at times was so painful,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.820]   that at times clearly was,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.540]   it just seemed like God was absent.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.740]   - Would you say,
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.000]   ♪ Even when you don't see it, you're working ♪
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.560]   - That's right, I absolutely would.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.400]   Had to.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.220]   - You know they're all thinking it.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.060]   - Oh, 100%.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.900]   And even when all that's going on,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.980]   that God is clearly at work.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.220]   Esther is one of the few, the two books in the Bible
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.900]   that does not mention the word of God,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.500]   or I mean the name of God.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.760]   But even though he's absent,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.860]   the whole purpose of the book
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.700]   is that God is at work throughout the story,
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.860]   and he's moving the pieces.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.860]   Even when you can't see it, he's working.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.700]   - That's right. - That's right.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.220]   Hey, we're gonna be Esther chapter seven.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.720]   If you have a Bible, flip it open there.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.160]   If not, it'll be up on the screen,
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.940]   and we're gonna fly through this story.
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.820]   We're gonna go through like four chapters,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.760]   and I'll summarize every now and then to keep it going.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.920]   So here we go.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.860]   Wait, what chapter?
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.420]   Chapter seven, last week ended with the king,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.420]   and the queen, and Haman all having dinner.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.340]   And the queen was like,
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.500]   "Hey, king, here's my one request.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.540]   "I wanna have dinner again with you tomorrow."
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.680]   Because the king and Esther had not come to the king yet
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.320]   and said, "Hey, there's a plan to kill all my people.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.540]   "And by the way, I'm Jewish."
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.940]   'Cause remember, she hid that.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.200]   So that's where we're gonna pick it up.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.280]   Dinner number two, we're sitting there
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.420]   with Esther, and the king, and Haman.
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.300]   What a bomb for sure.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.140]   All right, verse one.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.060]   So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther's banquet.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.220]   So they're at the dinner table.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.180]   On the second occasion, while they were drinking wine,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.340]   and the king again said to Esther,
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.860]   "Hey, tell me what you want, Queen Esther.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.920]   "What is your request?
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.660]   "I will give it to you even if it is up
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.180]   "to half of my kingdom."
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.020]   Queen Esther replied, "If I found favor with the king,
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.340]   "and if it pleases the king to grant my request,
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.720]   "I ask," here's my request,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   "that my life and the lives of my people be spared.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.500]   "For my people and I have been sold
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.460]   "to those who would kill, slaughter, and annihilate us."
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.920]   I love this next sentence.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.060]   "If we had merely been sold as slaves,
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.700]   "I could remain quiet.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.860]   "For that would have been too trivial a matter
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.420]   "to warrant disturbing the king."
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.600]   As in like, hey, they're planning to kill us.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.080]   Had we just been sold as slaves,
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.520]   I wouldn't even have bothered you.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.040]   I know you're a really busy guy,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.760]   but I figured if they kill the queen,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.360]   somebody is gonna lose their job
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.440]   'cause you're gonna be like, "Hey, where's the queen?"
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.920]   And they're gonna be like, "Oh, we killed her."
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.480]   And that's not gonna be a good day for anybody.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.120]   So I figured it was probably worth bringing up to you.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.620]   It's like such funny wording.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.960]   Who would do such a thing?
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.400]   King Xerxes, Jake Gyllenhaal demands,
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.980]   "Who would be so presumptuous as to touch you, the queen?"
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.500]   Esther replied.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.300]   And remember, it's Esther, Xerxes, and Haman
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.380]   sitting at the dinner table.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.860]   - Jafar. - Jafar.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.700]   - About to get exposed.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.700]   - "This wicked Haman, who is our adversary and our enemy.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.220]   "Haman grew pale with fright before the king and the queen."
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.440]   I don't think Haman knew that Esther was Jewish.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.180]   So he's probably sitting in there at the dinner table
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.840]   with the king and the queen, and the queen's like,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.420]   "Hey, king, here's my one request.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.380]   "They're planning to kill me and all my people
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.320]   "and all my family."
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.900]   And Haman's going, "Wow, that is crazy.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.340]   "I didn't know there was other crazy murderers out there
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.340]   "planning to genocide an entire people,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.660]   "but who would do that against the queen?
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.280]   "That's nuts, who would ever do that?"
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.520]   And then she says, "By the way, it's Haman."
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.480]   And he's gotta be going, "I had no idea she was the queen,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.680]   "the king." - The gulp.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.340]   - Yeah, that's a huge gulp moment.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.500]   "The king steps outside and he's in a rage.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.640]   "Jumped to his feet, he went out into the palace garden.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.100]   "Haman, however, stayed behind," verse seven,
[00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.940]   "to plead for his life with queen Esther.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.740]   "For he knew that the king intended to kill him.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.460]   "In his despair, he fell on the couch
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.080]   "where queen Esther was reclining.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.580]   "Just as the king was returning from the palace garden,
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.100]   "the king exclaimed, 'Will he even assault the queen
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.100]   "'right here in the palace before my very eyes?'"
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.940]   So he's just groveling for his life
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.600]   and he falls on the couch that she's sitting on
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.660]   and the king comes back in
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.800]   and he doesn't think he's groveling,
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.620]   he thinks he's assaulting my wife.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.120]   He's like, "Dude, this is game over."
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.660]   "As soon as the king spoke,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.020]   "his attendants covered Haman's face, signaling his doom."
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.420]   They put a bag over his head.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.340]   He'd never see light of day again.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.300]   "Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs,
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.400]   "said, 'Haman has set up a sharpened pole
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.360]   "'that stands 75 feet tall in his own courtyard.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.540]   "'He intended to use it to impale Mordecai,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.900]   "'the man who saved the king from assassination.'"
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.500]   So Harbona's sitting there
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.580]   and we don't know what his feeling of Haman,
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.660]   but he at least is like, "Hey, I got an idea.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.180]   "There's a big pole in Haman's yard.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.380]   "He was planning to kill Mordecai."
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.260]   You remember Mordecai, the guy who saved your life.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.100]   I mean, as great as that guy was,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.740]   can't believe Haman would wanna do that,
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.940]   but why don't we throw him on the pole?
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.980]   - 'Cause he was trying to get a job.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.980]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.920]   He was trying to get a promo.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.140]   "Then impale Haman on it, the king ordered.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.420]   "So they impaled Haman on the pole
[00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.580]   "he had set up for Mordecai
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.980]   "and the king's anger subsided."
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.260]   None of this is what the Bible is saying is good
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.900]   or right or ideal.
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.960]   It just is describing what happened.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.560]   It's interesting, and we may come back to this,
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.300]   is that the enemy of God's people
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.820]   and his plot was ended by the death of someone
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.980]   on a wooden pole or on a tree.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.300]   The same word is used for crucifixion.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.500]   So it's just interesting parallel
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.000]   to what happened with Jesus years and years and years later,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.100]   that Jesus would end the enemy's plot,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.440]   not by the enemy dying on a pole,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.740]   but by Jesus dying on a cross for you and for me.
[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.680]   Esther chapter eight, verse one,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.260]   "On the same day, King Xerxes gave the property of Haman,"
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.160]   who is number two in land, the guy's got a big estate,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.720]   "the enemy of the Jews to Queen Esther.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.560]   "Then Mordecai was brought before the king,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.260]   "for Esther had told the king how they were related."
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.180]   It was her uncle.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.580]   "And the king took off his signet ring,
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.900]   "which he had taken back from Haman,
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.880]   "and he gave it to Mordecai.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.180]   "And Esther appointed Mordecai
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.080]   "to be in charge of Haman's property."
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.840]   So Mordecai all of a sudden is now elevated
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.420]   essentially to Haman's position, number two in the land.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.800]   And Esther is given Haman's property.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.940]   "Esther went again before the king,
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.040]   "falling down on his face at his feet
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.780]   "and begging him with tears to stop the evil plot
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.200]   "devised by Haman against the Jews."
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.800]   She goes down and she's like, "Please stop.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.060]   "They're gonna kill my people.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.040]   "He's fixed today."
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.700]   Remember that decree had gone out a couple of weeks ago,
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.780]   that just horrifically all the Jewish people were told
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.160]   on that fixed day, they were liable to be killed
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.680]   or anybody could kill them and take their stuff.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.980]   And she's begging, "Please reverse that decree."
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.940]   "Esther said, 'If it pleases the king,
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.700]   "if I found favor with him,
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.760]   "and if he thinks it is right and I'm pleasing him,
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.980]   "let there be a decree that reverses the order of Haman,
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.820]   "who ordered that the Jews throughout the king's provinces
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.520]   "should be destroyed.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.460]   "For how can I," verse six,
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.940]   "endure to see my people and my family
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.440]   "slaughtered and destroyed?"
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.060]   Verse eight, "Now go ahead and send,"
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.500]   King Xerxes replies,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.800]   "send a message to the Jews in the king's name,
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.120]   "telling them whatever you want
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.920]   "and seal it with the king's ring.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.900]   "But remember, whatever has already been written
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.940]   "in the king's name and sealed with his signet ring
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.940]   "can never be revoked."
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.920]   So this is interesting.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.820]   And that time, any time a king
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.020]   or any time that the leader of the country made a law,
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.940]   it was impossible to reverse that law.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.480]   You could make other laws,
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.600]   but unlike today where you can repeal something.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.040]   And that time with the Persian empire,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.000]   anytime a king made something,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.720]   some people think it may have been
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.240]   because they thought of him as like deity
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.680]   or different reasons behind that,
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.640]   but they couldn't reverse it.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.120]   They could just add other laws to it.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.800]   So he's going, "I can't reverse the fact
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.920]   "that we already said the Jewish people
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:09.880]   "will be killed on this day,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.320]   "but we can add additional laws."
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.580]   And he says, "Write whatever you want, put it in there."
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.280]   So in June 25th, I love the detail, man, of the Bible.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.760]   King's secretaries were summoned
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.000]   and a decree was written exactly as Mordecai dictated it.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.400]   The decree, verse 10, was written
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.560]   in the name of King Xerxes, sealed with the signet ring.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.040]   And Mordecai sent the dispatches by swift messengers
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.600]   who rode fast horses,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.360]   bred for the king's service all throughout the empire.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.440]   Here's what the king's decree said.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.340]   So Mordecai writes on the down, they send it out.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.840]   It's a new decree.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.320]   "It gave the Jews in every city authority
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.980]   "to unite and defend themselves.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.120]   "They were allowed to kill, slaughter,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.860]   "and annihilate anyone of any nationality or province
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.760]   "who might attack them or their children or their wives,
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.260]   "and to take the property of their enemies.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.520]   "The chosen day for this event
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.700]   "throughout the provinces of King Xerxes
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.760]   "was March 7th of next year."
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.040]   So they had a decree that they were to be killed.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.240]   And basically this new decree was like,
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.480]   "Hey, you guys can unite, prepare, be ready for war."
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.380]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.200]   It's like the Hunger Games and Game of Thrones
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.380]   and just nuts stuff going on.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.220]   And as we're gonna see though,
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.240]   God was clearly at work in the midst of all of it,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.040]   but that's the second decree that's been put out there.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   Uh, the king's, oh, sorry, verse 15.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.640]   "Then Mordecai left the king's presence
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.220]   "wearing the royal robe of blue and white,
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.860]   "the great crown of gold,
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.660]   "and an outer cloak of fine linen and purple."
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.180]   So he's looking good.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.940]   "And the people of Susa celebrated the new decree.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.860]   "The Jews were filled with joy and gladness,
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.560]   "were honored everywhere.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.580]   "In every province and city,
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.300]   "wherever the king's decree arrived,
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.860]   "the Jews rejoiced and a great celebration took place
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.320]   "and declared a public festival and holiday.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   "And many of the people of the land became Jews themselves."
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.940]   We're gonna come back to that.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.780]   Verse, "For they feared what the Jews might do to them."
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.180]   Chapter nine, verse one.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.480]   "So on March 7th, the two decrees of the king,"
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.560]   so fast forward, 'cause remember it was in June 25th.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.360]   Now we're all the way into March.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.160]   The day comes, the two decrees of the king
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.000]   are put into effect.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.220]   "And on that day, the enemy of the Jews,
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.700]   "who had hoped to overpower them,
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.020]   "but quite the opposite happened.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.100]   "It was the Jews who overpowered their enemies."
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.380]   So anybody who came and attacked them,
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.560]   the Jewish people were victorious.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.940]   "The Jews gathered together in cities
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.180]   "all throughout the king's provinces
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.180]   "to attack anyone who tried to harm them,
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.980]   "but no one could take a stand against them,
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.600]   "for everyone was afraid of them."
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.200]   And here's one of the reasons why, verse three.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.720]   "For all the nobles," that's the royalty of the provinces,
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.420]   that's like the governors of all the states, if you will,
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.820]   'cause they have 127 states, be like in America,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.380]   "All the people in authority in every state,
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.100]   "the highest officers, governors, royal officials,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.840]   "they all helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.500]   "For Mordecai had been promoted in the king's palace,
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.780]   "and his fame had spread all throughout the provinces
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.620]   "and the empire."
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.880]   So they go out, they successfully defend themselves.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.840]   The rest of the armies in these provinces
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.040]   help them and protect them.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.020]   And so that's likely one of the reasons why,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.680]   in addition to God just giving them favor and protection,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.840]   that they are successful, they don't lose their lives,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.220]   and they're victorious on that day.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.120]   But the victory still involved them going to fight
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.240]   and then protecting themselves.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.460]   It still involved a battle with them.
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.440]   Verse 20, "At the end, to celebrate the victory
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.760]   "that God had given them,
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.520]   "Mordecai recorded these events and he sent letters
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.800]   "to the Jewish people in the kingdom."
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.080]   So the battle's over, the Jewish people won
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.680]   and saved their lives.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.060]   And Mordecai sends out letters to everybody
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.660]   in the, every Jewish person throughout the provinces,
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.120]   "Calling them to celebrate an annual festival
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.680]   "on these two days.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.420]   "He told them to celebrate them with feasting and gladness
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.460]   "by giving gifts of food to each other,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.860]   "presents to the poor.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.260]   "This would commemorate a time when Jews gained relief
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.460]   "from their enemies,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.680]   "when their sorrow was turned into gladness
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.580]   "and their mourning was turned into joy."
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.400]   So you following it?
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.340]   So basically, they're victorious and he's like,
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.540]   "We're for now on going forward,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.100]   "gonna celebrate this day every single year."
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.900]   So Jewish people everywhere celebrate
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.780]   God's deliverance of his people.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.900]   - The day that they were supposed to be wiped out.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.900]   - Yes.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.260]   The day they were supposed to die
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.180]   was the day that they--
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.020]   - Are now celebrating.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.800]   - Celebrate are victorious.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.020]   Skip down to verse 29 of chapter nine.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.620]   "Queen Esther, daughter of Abigail,"
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.100]   Abigail, happy to say that.
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.800]   "Along with Mordecai, the Jew wrote another letter
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.860]   "putting the Queen's full authority
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.180]   "behind Mordecai's letter
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.860]   "to establish the festival of Purim,"
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.620]   which is a festival that even today,
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.100]   Jewish people still celebrate.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.780]   But really the entire book ends
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.540]   and we're told that God,
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.660]   in the midst of all the brokenness and chaos,
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.000]   he preserves, he protects his people.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.660]   He puts Esther in a position of authority
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.900]   and he reverses Haman's all the wicked plan
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.220]   and the day that they were to die
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.860]   became a day of celebration
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.760]   and the clear message of the entire book
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.800]   is that even when you can't see God's face,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.960]   that he's not at the forefront,
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.580]   he is very clearly at work.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.720]   Even when it looks like he's not working,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.600]   he is using everything chaotic and broken,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.800]   he's using Corona right now
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.120]   and he's still at work all around us.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.240]   And that's really been the message
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.040]   and one of the reasons that today,
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.680]   again, as we said,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.260]   Purim was celebrated a couple of weeks ago
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.640]   by those who are Jewish, if you have Jewish friends,
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.120]   but that took place this year on March 9th.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.900]   But here's what I wanna focus on for a few minutes.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.620]   I wanna pull out three principles
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.460]   that are just parallels to, I think, our experience
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.840]   as it relates to living a successful life.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.360]   Three things that parallel.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.200]   Anything you wanna add or clarify or that was confusing?
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.960]   - The one thing, it's a lot of text.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.840]   - It's a lot of text.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.120]   - I think the one thing, can you just paraphrase for me,
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.420]   so they couldn't get rid of a decree
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.260]   that the king had made,
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.760]   but they could write, she could write another one.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.560]   He gave her the pen and paper and said,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.460]   "You get to write it."
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.320]   - Mordecai, yeah.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.120]   - Oh, okay, Mordecai got to write it.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.340]   - Yep. - Good to know.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.760]   And what exactly did he,
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.960]   can you just paraphrase one more time what he wrote?
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   - He basically wrote out that,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.640]   "Hey, all the Jewish people out there can band together."
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.120]   And it's kind of a funny thing,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.040]   'cause you'd be like, "What else were you gonna do?"
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.480]   But they may have had access
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.840]   to the king's military or military around there.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.220]   They certainly, by Mordecai writing that,
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.840]   were given encouragement from the local state governments
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.520]   that they were a part of to support the Jewish people.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.800]   And basically he wrote out that Jewish people
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.720]   can proactively attack anybody
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.760]   that they think may be attacking them.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.600]   - Gotcha.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.120]   - So he gave the right and permission to do that legally.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.920]   - So it made them seem more powerful.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.760]   - Exactly.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.880]   - That way everyone is like, "I'm with the Jews,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.160]   'cause the king's with the Jews."
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.120]   - Exactly. - Gotcha.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.000]   - Hey, you mess with them, it's not gonna go well.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.640]   And even the local governors and governments
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.120]   were all supporting the Jewish people.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.080]   - That's interesting.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.320]   'Cause I think I naturally would have suspected
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.920]   some way for war not to even happen at all.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.080]   I don't know, like something creative.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.360]   But it's interesting to, okay, it makes a lot more sense.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.600]   That there was a victory, but it still involved fighting.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.860]   So really, let me camp on three things
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.640]   that I think as we wrap up the book,
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.200]   just wanna highlight that I see in the story
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.880]   that's such a parallel to our lives.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.520]   The first one is this.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.660]   You and I can't change the past,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.360]   but you can alter the future.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.100]   Just like the king, he couldn't change what had been written,
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.320]   but he could write a new law.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.040]   Hey, I can't change what's in the past, that's already there,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   but I can change what will happen in the future.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.280]   That's such a parallel, I think,
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.840]   for our experiences as humans,
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.680]   because you and I, at some point in realizing in life,
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.880]   if you're gonna have a successful life,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.720]   you've gotta realize,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.160]   hey, I can't go back and relive the past.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.560]   There's gonna be things in my rear view mirror
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.360]   from high school, college, whatever stage of life you're in
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.240]   that you wish you had a do-over on,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.440]   and although you cannot go back and rewrite the past,
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.320]   you can rewrite the future that you're in.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.040]   And this is so huge, because people,
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.360]   they walk around today,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.760]   and the shame and guilt from their past,
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.640]   I mean, Christians will walk around today,
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   and they have shame and guilt from past decisions,
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.760]   past broken relationships, abortion, sexual abuse,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.920]   things that were done to them.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.320]   And there's this sense of like,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.160]   man, I just carry a guilt
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.240]   that I wish I could do away with, or get rid of,
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.000]   or I wish that I hadn't blown it on my first job
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.880]   with that employer, with parents.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.000]   You cannot go back and undo the past.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.640]   Jesus can forgive, and it has been forgiven
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.720]   if you are in Christ.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.300]   And although you cannot go and do that,
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.240]   you can rewrite the future you're headed to.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.420]   Paul, the apostle, would say that you, if you're in Jesus,
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.120]   you're no longer marked by the things
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.320]   that you've done before.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.880]   You're no longer marked by your past,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.200]   that if anyone is in Christ,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.640]   2 Corinthians 5, verses 16 and 17,
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.900]   they're a new creation.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.140]   The old is gone, and the new is here.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.040]   Paul, who was a murderer,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.840]   who could have been easily tempted to go like,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.720]   man, I cannot believe,
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.740]   he was a murderer before he became a Christian.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.080]   Like he had done things that most people listening
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.440]   will never compare to the level.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.320]   Paul said he was the chief of sinners.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.440]   And we at least know he was responsible
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.360]   for the death of Christians.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.560]   And he says, "One thing, I do not consider myself
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.740]   "as having taken hold of everything in Christ,
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.860]   "but one thing I do, I forget what is behind me,
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.280]   "and I strain towards what is ahead."
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.760]   Not that there's not consequences for decisions in our past,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.000]   and not that there's not things that we can go back
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.160]   and own and ask forgiveness for,
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.680]   but you cannot rewrite the past,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.940]   but you can rewrite the future.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.040]   And that's important,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.920]   because unproductive is me sitting around being like,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.120]   man, I just, I'm covered in shame and guilt.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.080]   I'm damaged goods.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.580]   This is how I see it a lot of times play out
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.180]   with young adults, is they think like,
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.560]   dude, I'm just, I'm damaged goods
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.960]   because of my dating history,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.800]   what I've done with guys, my sexual past.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.480]   Like a godly girl, a godly guy will never like me.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.640]   - Yeah, being abused.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.000]   - I've been abused. - Abortion.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.720]   - It's just, I had an abortion.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.680]   Like I just, I'm unworthy.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.040]   And the message of the gospel
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.480]   is that you have been totally forgiven.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.080]   And Jesus doesn't look at you and define you by your past.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.840]   And he wants you to begin to realign
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.480]   and redefine your future according to his word.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.440]   And that is a place where you are in the driver's seat.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.680]   While you can't go back and rewrite
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.080]   just like the king, I can't re undo
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.720]   what has already taken place and been written,
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.400]   but I can write something new.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.960]   And so for us, I think it looks like us going,
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.820]   man, I am in the driver's seat of writing the future
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.680]   that God is, the future story I'm gonna have
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.420]   and the future that is in front of me.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.040]   How am I doing at really taking advantage of that?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.920]   - Yeah, I, another one, a person I wanna speak to,
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.320]   I just thought of was like, I think someone who's been caught
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.920]   like if you've been caught in a really wrong action,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.240]   a sinful action, whatever it may be,
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.520]   I think a lot of times the enemy really keeps you stuck.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.640]   Like he, it almost like the shame that comes with being caught
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.800]   can almost make you feel like you're never worthy again
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.520]   to do something, especially something kingdom minded.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.400]   Something with the Lord on your side,
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.600]   it can just forever feel like
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.040]   that's kind of your reputation now.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.520]   And so just even this applies to the person
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.120]   that has been caught in an action.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.160]   - Totally. - They're ashamed of.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.960]   And for me, David, like something you're making me think of
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.360]   is in this story, when the king is giving Mordecai
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.160]   the ability to rewrite, he says,
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.720]   "But you may write," in verse eight of chapter eight,
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.920]   "But you may write as you please with regard to the Jews
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.040]   "in the name of the king and seal it with the king's ring
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.500]   "for an edict written in the name of the king
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.320]   "and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked."
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.400]   And I'm so sorry if you were going here, I don't,
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.240]   but Ephesians one just says, "In him,"
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.640]   so in the death of Christ
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.360]   and his death, burial and resurrection,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.160]   "In him, you also, when you heard the word of truth,
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.240]   "the gospel of your salvation and believed in him
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.600]   "were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit."
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.960]   And Titus 3, five, "He saved us not because of works
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.160]   "done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.600]   "by the washing of regeneration
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.920]   "and the renewal of the Holy Spirit."
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.560]   That Holy Spirit that seals us.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   And I think a lot of people, they think,
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.520]   like you're saying, something of their past,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.920]   that that ceiling doesn't exist for them.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.400]   It's like, well, I broke it and now I'm over, I'm doomed,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.360]   but this tells us that the Holy Spirit
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.240]   is what secures our identity in Christ.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.080]   - Totally.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.680]   - It's not dependent on our own actions.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.560]   - Yeah. - It's really encouraging.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.400]   - So really wallowing in the past is just not a,
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.840]   for a follower of Jesus, the best thing you can do is say,
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.040]   "Hey, the past doesn't define me, Jesus does,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.400]   "and now I get to be a part of helping define the future
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.480]   "in front of me."
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.620]   So wherever you're at today,
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.360]   the best opportunity in front of you is going,
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.080]   "Man, I wanna be on purpose and intentional
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.420]   "as I write the person, as I write the chapter
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.060]   "that I'm gonna live out as the future in front of me comes.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.980]   "I'm gonna surrender every day to Jesus
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.880]   "and try to live according to his word.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.440]   "I'm gonna, some of you that maybe,
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.180]   "I need to confess hidden sin
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.100]   "that I've never opened up to anybody about.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.500]   "Others, you being intentional to rewrite
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.020]   "or write the future that,
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.260]   "that future story you're gonna tell
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.220]   "will involve you breaking up with a relationship right now
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.840]   "that you just know is toxic,
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.320]   "or you're not in a place to date."
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.540]   Like, let's just be honest.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.480]   You're not in a place where you're healthy enough.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.160]   Others of you, it may involve forgiving a family member
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.260]   who really hurt you, or asking for forgiveness
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.460]   from a family member that you really hurt,
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.440]   even if they haven't asked you for that forgiveness.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.900]   Like, "Hey, I'm just gonna extend it."
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.900]   But we are all in the driver's seat,
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.020]   largely as it relates to writing the story in front of us.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.100]   So you can't undo the past,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.540]   but you can rewrite or alter the future
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.380]   that you're gonna head.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.220]   And you are headed towards.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.060]   And I think one thing that ministered to me
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.460]   that I've been, I heard recently from a friend
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:02.460]   that is like, at some point, this season of Corona,
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.140]   we talked about it on "Views from the Porch,"
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.640]   is gonna be a story that we look back on,
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.020]   and it was a season of our life,
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.820]   and we tell about that season.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.420]   Like, it's a story, it'll be a part of all of our story,
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.620]   it'll be in the past,
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.940]   and it'll be a part of the story that we tell.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.380]   And that's really true for all of us in life right now.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.240]   At some point, this season today,
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.780]   what you're doing with your 20s,
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.820]   the type of dating relationships and how you date,
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.340]   the way you use your time, how you work at the office,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.780]   that's all gonna be a part of the story
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.300]   that when you're 40 or 50 or 60,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   you're gonna look back and be,
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.140]   "This is the story of how I met your mom,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.460]   "how we pursued purity, how we dated together,
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.140]   "or hey, how we kinda slept together.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.080]   "We met at that bar, we met on Tinder,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.820]   "and we ended up just getting married
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.460]   "after we lived together for three years."
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.700]   Both of those are two versions of stories,
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.860]   and you get to today decide which type of story
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.300]   do you wanna tell, and which story are you writing?
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.260]   Because the decisions you're making today
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.460]   are shaping the future you're headed to.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.300]   - That's so good.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.460]   - So here, really quickly, the next one,
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.140]   and I don't know how much time we have here,
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.420]   but next one on--
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.260]   - You're doing great.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.700]   - Yeah, where you gonna go, man?
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.540]   Can't go anywhere.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.360]   - What do you hope you have to do?
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.820]   - Corona, for real.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.020]   - The next thing from this story that just jumps out to me
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.180]   that we talked a little bit about already
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:17.180]   was you can't win the battle if you aren't willing to fight.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.620]   You can't win any victory,
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.020]   you won't have victory over a battle,
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.060]   like you won't win the battle if you're not willing to fight.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.040]   What does that have to do with us?
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.860]   And none of us are, most of us are not, you know,
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.940]   in the army or in the military.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.300]   Here's where I see it in their story.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.500]   God said, "God provided a way and a path towards victory,
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.140]   "but it involved them still fighting."
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.500]   Like you observed that, which is really interesting.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.340]   You could have thought like,
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.180]   "Oh, he just stopped everything from happening."
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.460]   And he didn't, he involved a victory
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.580]   that also involved them fighting.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.740]   And I think for most of us,
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.900]   no, not even for most of us, for all of us,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.820]   any great victory over the spiritual battles
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.500]   and temptations and sins that you have to wage war against
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.340]   and I have to wage war against involves us both
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.800]   all having to fight.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.460]   There's this idea in Christianity that,
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.880]   hey, once you become a Christian,
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.260]   the temptations I have to lust after people
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.180]   who are not my wife or to get angry at people
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.260]   who frustrate me or to be selfish,
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.780]   all those kind of just went away
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.700]   'cause the Holy Spirit now takes over.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.620]   And that for most, not even for most of us,
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.500]   for everyone is not the case.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.580]   That when you follow Jesus,
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.820]   it involves daily picking up your cross,
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.940]   Jesus would say in Mark chapter nine,
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.740]   and following him, which is daily dying to yourself
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.720]   and dying to your sin nature.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.240]   How would you describe a sin nature?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.560]   - A sin nature is that thing in me
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.740]   that has always just been there.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.380]   And a really practical example,
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.980]   if I were to go home right now
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.840]   and my roommates who have been at home all day,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.500]   there's dishes in the sink,
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.300]   I could walk in and just naturally,
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.320]   I could just naturally assume the worst and be like,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.740]   man, they're so lazy.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.580]   They've just been sitting around here
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.700]   watching Netflix all day
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.180]   and no one's doing the dishes
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.500]   and just find myself frustrated at my roommates.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.660]   And for all I know, they've had a really difficult day.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.020]   And instead of just doing the dishes,
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.140]   like that's just something in me
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.980]   that just is just naturally there
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.980]   and it's always been there.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:18.340]   - Yeah, it's a thing in all of us
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.940]   that allows sin to come naturally.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.420]   It's like why I never have to work at being angry.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.380]   Like you've never had to work at being selfish.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.140]   Nobody has to work at being like,
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.460]   you know what's really hard for me?
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.740]   Well, I don't know if this is true for most of us,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.060]   lusting or being entitled.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.940]   That just, it doesn't come easy for me.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.380]   I feel like I'm just so gracious and good.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.500]   That person listening is clearly clouded by pride
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.260]   that comes naturally and easy to that person.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.620]   But it's that thing inside of all of us
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.900]   where sin just comes naturally.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.880]   It's a part of our nature.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.220]   The Bible says that is your sin nature.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.200]   And as long as you and I are in this life,
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.100]   that's gonna be a part of our life.
[00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:58.200]   And so daily, I have to not listen to that
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.080]   and put that to death
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.780]   and try to walk in dependence on the spirit of God.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.180]   In Romans 8, verse 13, along this idea of,
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.840]   hey, you can't win the battle.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:09.940]   If your battle's anxiety,
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.140]   maybe it's an eating disorder, a pornography,
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.660]   a body image in general,
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.660]   maybe it's an anger problem, whatever, fill in the blank.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.740]   You won't win that battle without you fighting against that,
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.820]   making the decision when I don't want to,
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.060]   when it's not easy,
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.040]   when it doesn't feel like the right thing to do.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.860]   I'm gonna choose to put that to death
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.700]   and choose not to follow that
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.500]   and try to follow God's word.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   In Romans 8, I said that, verse 13, it says,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.140]   "If you live according to your sinful nature, you will die.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.820]   But if by the spirit you put to death
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.020]   the misdeeds of the body, you will live."
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.380]   Colossians chapter three says,
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.360]   "Put to death whatever belongs to your earthly nature."
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.700]   Sexual morality, and he just gives some examples.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.680]   Impurity, lust, evil desires, greed, which is idolatry.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.100]   In 1 Peter chapter two, verse 11, it says,
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.260]   "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles,
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.420]   abstain from your sinful desires,
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.580]   which wage war against your soul."
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.740]   The Bible says, you and I have to declare war
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.020]   on our sin nature, on all the different ways
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.940]   that sin manifests, or sin pops up in my life.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.500]   Anytime it happens, I gotta go to war against it.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.740]   And I love Peter's language 'cause he says,
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.300]   "Your sin nature's already declared war on you.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.920]   You should declare war on it."
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.260]   That John Owen, this old pastor, made a line that like,
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.780]   "Hey, if you are either, all of us in life
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.560]   are either killing sin or it is killing us."
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.100]   It's killing relationships,
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.660]   it's killing our relationship with God,
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.960]   our love for people, killing like,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.660]   it ends people's actual lives all the time.
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.660]   And the Bible says that you and I can experience victory,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.460]   but it involves a fight, a battle.
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.700]   So if your struggle is same-sex attraction,
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.260]   if it is an eating disorder, if it's lust or anger,
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.500]   like are my problems, it involves me daily.
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.020]   Here's what I said the battle looks like.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.620]   Here's how I define it.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.860]   And scripturally, at least, he calls us to all this.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.520]   I'd love to hear what you'd add or if you agree.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.460]   Biblically, we battle by living authentically
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.520]   with the people of God, according to the word of God,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.820]   and depending on the spirit of God.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.500]   Biblically, here's how you battle.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.380]   Every single day, this is a day by day, it's not fixed,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.700]   it's not a one time.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.180]   Every day, I have to battle by living authentically,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.900]   that's confessing sin to other people
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.260]   who are followers of Jesus, at like a heart level.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.300]   Like I was tempted, I'm tempted to believe
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.340]   that my worth comes from my paycheck.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.740]   I'm tempted to believe that, it's tempted to just lust.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.460]   I'm having lustful thoughts about a coworker
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.180]   that I work with or about past relationships,
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.860]   or I clicked on something on the internet,
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:51.500]   on social media that I just like spent too much time
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.420]   on that girl's page.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.780]   I gotta confess all those things
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.620]   and do confess all those things to my small group of guys.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.700]   As I wage war and battle,
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.040]   I'm living authentically with the people of God,
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.800]   according to the word of God that I wanna align.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.380]   And this is tricky in this culture, man,
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.220]   'cause the Bible says align your life with the word of God.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.420]   And everybody wants to align the word of God
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.780]   with their wants.
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.300]   Like this is kind of, this is what I think he really means
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.020]   and that's not relevant, it's kind of outdated.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.140]   And you can't trust everything that's in there.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.840]   I mean, we don't eat shellfish, we do eat shellfish,
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.780]   come on, good grief.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.340]   - Leviticus. - Leviticus.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.420]   It's like the go-to everyone has, it's like Leviticus.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:28.340]   - Don't have tattoos.
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.700]   - You still eat bacon, right?
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.580]   You say no bacon?
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.660]   No, with so many podcasts we have out on there,
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.980]   that is a dumb question,
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.540]   but if that is something you fall into,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:37.780]   go check us out on Abuse from the Forge
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:41.220]   as it relates to why the Bible's appropriate or relevant.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.740]   But point being, I live authentically with the word of God.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.500]   I try to align my life and have others align my life with,
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.500]   sorry, with the people of God,
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.940]   align my life with the word of God
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.100]   and walk in dependence on the spirit of God.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.060]   The day by day, God, I can't defeat anger,
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.320]   I can't defeat lust, I can't defeat anxiety,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.220]   I need your help.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.680]   And that just involves, and moment by moment, prayerfulness
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.660]   and trying to walk in the spirit.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.660]   And anytime that I don't walk in line, I don't battle,
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.600]   I do the first thing.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.280]   I live authentically with the people of God
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.760]   and I bring it into the light
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.360]   and I have others encourage me on that journey.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.920]   But that's a day by day, every single,
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.240]   I think the thing that's hardest for me,
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.920]   the thing that I hate about it is I wish it was gone.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.960]   I wish it was over, you didn't have to battle.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.240]   And every day I have to get up and still battle that.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.180]   Last year, I think I've shared on here before,
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:35.520]   went through regeneration, which is our 12 step recovery.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.720]   And it's like celebrate recovery.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.120]   It's an amazing ministry if you're in Dallas
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:43.220]   or if you have regeneration at your church.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.040]   But just because I saw like there was some anger in my heart
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.360]   and lust that I wanted to get rid of
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.200]   and really just anger that was not allowing me
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:56.080]   to respond in a way that was the gentleness
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.120]   or the husband that had gentleness
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.160]   and care and consideration.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.480]   And I was like, I don't want to live life
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.220]   and not have done everything I can
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.780]   to be the father I wanna be, the husband I wanna be,
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.360]   the person that I wanna be and the follower of Jesus.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.360]   And in that process, it just was pulling back layers
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.840]   and going, God, make me more like Christ,
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.840]   will you help me?
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.200]   There's still so much brokenness in my heart
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.840]   and I need your help.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.600]   And daily, I wish regeneration,
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.680]   it was like, it's over, finished.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.160]   Took me a year, I went through it.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.720]   And now for the rest of your life,
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.480]   you're just learning to put to death the deeds of the flesh,
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.320]   to put to death that sinful nature inside of you.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.800]   So I think again, the idea of you can't win,
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.260]   you will not be victorious, whatever your struggle is.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.320]   I just wanna put to death the lie that people have out there
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.000]   that you're gonna wake up one day
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.540]   and you won't even desire,
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.400]   same sex attraction won't happen.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.680]   Maybe that's a part, maybe that'll happen,
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.920]   but for a lot of people, that's not.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.640]   And they constantly put it to death
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   or one day you're gonna wake up
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.360]   and you no longer have anxiety.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:00.120]   I don't know the person that that's their story.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.440]   And they're probably out there and God bless them.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.920]   For most of us, it involves doing what Paul said,
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.320]   walk by the spirit and you will not gratify
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.360]   the sinful nature, Galatians 5.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.100]   So anything you'd add?
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.080]   - Yeah, I gotta make sure I don't,
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.840]   there's like a passion point of mine.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.480]   And I think especially because I know a lot of people
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.440]   my age, we have almost unintentionally
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.320]   been trained to be consumers.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.360]   And what happens to consumers, they become fat
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.960]   and they don't know how to do things on their own.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.420]   They're just sitting there like a baby bird
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.360]   with their mouth open, wanting to be fed by their mom.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.800]   And they never become mature Christians.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.420]   They don't ever get to feast on the meat.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.520]   They stay on the milk all of their life.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.560]   And that's not the life that Christ calls us to live.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.240]   And so for me, I always tell people,
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.080]   hey, you have to get out of that consumeristic mindset.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.880]   You have to stop waiting for things to come to you
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.800]   and you have to start being proactive, not reactive.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.560]   That's what I always say, because the war is coming to you.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   That's why I personally love watching war movies
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.840]   because it reminds me so much of this mentality.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.400]   There is a spiritual war going,
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.840]   waging war against my flesh every day.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.800]   And I think a lot of people are like,
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.240]   oh, it's too gory, it's too bloody.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.680]   And I'm like, that is nothing compared
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.960]   to the spiritual war that is going on.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   And the enemy, that way that he is wanting to destroy you
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.600]   is nothing compared to even what you're seeing on that movie.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.640]   And in those movies, a lot of times what's happening is,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.880]   it's like there's that scene
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.600]   where everything finally calms down
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.120]   and everyone's asleep, like in the bunkers or whatever.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.960]   And then what do you know?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.000]   You hear the sound and then just a bomb hits.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.760]   They had no time to prepare.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.560]   They had no time to arm themselves
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.320]   and they are losing because they weren't ready
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.720]   and they couldn't have predicted it.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.560]   The same with us.
[00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.400]   If you're not waking up every day,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.960]   Ephesians six, putting on the armor of God,
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.720]   not praying, asking the Holy Spirit to lead you,
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.840]   to guide you, to convict you and walking proactively,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:53.760]   it's gonna be too late because the war is coming,
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.640]   whether you want it to or not.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:59.000]   And I always say, no one runs into the battle unarmed.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.760]   And so when you make that choice, like you're talking about,
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.280]   when you make that choice to not get up every single day,
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.240]   put on that armor, grab the weapon, the sword,
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.480]   grab people, other fellow people
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.000]   going to the fight with you.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.280]   And then ultimately following and trusting the commander,
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.200]   the Lord, I mean, you're gonna fall.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.040]   - Totally.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.160]   - And so I just, I would say for me,
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.880]   one myth that I just wanna speak against really quick
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.480]   that I think is people look at people like us
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   and they almost make it like we're really far off
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.160]   and that we don't get it.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.880]   Like we don't have a flesh that wars every day.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.800]   And I always tell people, I'm like,
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.720]   if only you knew how much I am getting tempted
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.320]   and how much the enemy is whispering in my ear
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.280]   and wanting me, he wants me just to fall one time
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.040]   to ruin everything.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.400]   That I, and it, the goodness that there is
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.620]   that God's grace abounds, but I'm saying, you know.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.800]   - There's no division between pastor and person out there.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.200]   - It just keeps, it's the rest of your life.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.200]   So you gotta be proactive.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.040]   - Here's what else is crazy.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.520]   So we're, we'll hang here just one more minute.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.360]   - Yeah.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.560]   - Again, you know where to go.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.840]   Is I feel like we've gotten to rub shoulders
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.360]   with just people, incredible pastors,
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.660]   like well-known people throughout the years
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.240]   who are leading incredible ministries around the country.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.600]   And what was almost surprising to me,
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.940]   it sounds crazy to say that.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.880]   And I'm hesitating to mention names here,
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.520]   but I bet a lot of our audience would know
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.360]   who those names are.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.680]   Godly men, well-known people.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.880]   Every single one of them has to do this as well.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.720]   - Yeah.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.560]   - Like you would think like, oh man, you're your ex person.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.480]   You have to do that?
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.680]   You figured it out.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.400]   - Yeah, you figured, no, all of them,
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.240]   every single one of them.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.720]   And anytime someone falls, like I'm never surprised.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.600]   People are always like shocked that somebody fell
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.320]   or made a mistake, had a moral failure.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.720]   And I'm like, dude, are you kidding me?
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.300]   They still have a sin nature.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.240]   The thing that comes naturally to them every single day
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.120]   is moral failure.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   Thing that comes naturally to all of us.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   And so anytime we don't go to war daily
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.400]   and moment by moment or are thoughtful
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.240]   and intentional and careful,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.080]   I have to crucify, I can't let this run me.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.560]   The thing that runs in neutral is a sin nature.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.800]   And every person, you never escape that.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.600]   And those guys, if there's anything worth respecting
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.160]   about anybody of any significant platform in Christianity,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.440]   it involves them daily crucifying their flesh.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.280]   And--
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.100]   - Just like anyone.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.400]   - Just like anyone, exactly.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.300]   So, all right, so first thing that we see
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.720]   is that you can't win the battle, I'm sorry.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.680]   First thing that we see is that you can't change the past,
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.400]   but you can alter the future.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.740]   Second thing, if you can't win the battle,
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.680]   if you are unwilling to fight.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.520]   And number three--
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.340]   - Take us home.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.760]   - You can't see the full story God is writing.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.320]   This seems the most abstract and like,
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.520]   duh, I can't see, are you too?
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.480]   Oh, I can't see everything that God's doing.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.320]   Wow.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.240]   - Gotta trust him.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.140]   - Here's what I think is profound.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.280]   Because in the midst of the confusion,
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.840]   it can seem like God is absent.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.800]   What is he doing?
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.880]   What is he up to?
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.600]   And for most of us, not most of us, all of us,
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.760]   you just can't see the full picture
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.160]   about what God is doing.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.680]   You know, your dad passing away,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.760]   a few years ago, you have no idea all the ways
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.560]   that God has used that and is,
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.560]   you know, I'm confident you've seen some of the ways,
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.880]   but all of the different ways that God is,
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.020]   at the end of time, you're gonna see like, wow,
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.400]   I had no idea this person's life,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.440]   and this person's life, and this person's life.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.980]   - My dad got to meet his long lost daughter
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.520]   because of his cancer,
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.860]   and got to lead her and her husband to Jesus.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   - So if you could see that in this side of heaven,
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.620]   think about all the ways that we'll be able to someday
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.680]   see the bigger picture of what God is writing.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.960]   And if you and I pause,
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.120]   and you just look around at the day circumstances
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.440]   or where you are in this moment,
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.020]   you'll be tempted to go, where the heck,
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.800]   God is clearly not at work, he's clearly not in this.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.840]   Here's where this comes from the story.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.360]   If Esther had stopped in the midst of the story,
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.080]   and hit pause at so many different places,
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.000]   you've been like, where, what is God doing?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.040]   Where is he in the story?
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.240]   Like, what do I mean by that?
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.360]   Think about if she had stopped whenever her parents died,
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.840]   'cause remember, she was an orphan.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   She buried both of her parents,
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.800]   had to move in with her uncle Mordecai,
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.120]   that's Uncle Jesse, in the city of Susa,
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.320]   some place far away.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.080]   Had she stopped and gone like, my parents are dead.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.360]   I'm a young girl, I'm an orphan.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.500]   Where is God?
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.160]   If she had just stopped at that part of the story,
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.240]   she wouldn't have been able to see the bigger picture
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.560]   and the amazing ways God was still at work
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:26.040]   despite the brokenness of her circumstances.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.760]   Had she stopped when she was forced
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.840]   to be a part of the bachelor Persia,
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.640]   and basically every beautiful girl in the empire
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.880]   was ripped out of their home
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.240]   and put to be property of the king
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.600]   unless they won the competition,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   and then they could be the queen.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.680]   She would have been like, where,
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.000]   how is God a part of this at all?
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.680]   Had she stopped when Mordecai, her uncle,
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.720]   stopped a murder or assassination attempt
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:46.560]   on the king's life.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.280]   There was a hit, there was people trying to kill the king,
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.400]   murdered, or Mordecai discovered it,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.480]   and he uncovered it for the king and he saved his life.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.720]   And the king did nothing to reward him for five years.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.320]   Had you stopped, you'd be like, what,
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.920]   especially because the guy who gets rewarded
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.000]   one verse later after Mordecai does that
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.760]   is Haman, the evil and wicked,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.840]   one who would try to kill all the Jewish people,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.080]   all the people of God.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.560]   You're like, where is God?
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.160]   How could God clearly be at work?
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.080]   When Haman was promoted to prime minister,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.040]   the most evil person who wants to kill everybody
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.420]   is now made the highest officer in the land.
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.600]   You'd go, where's God at work?
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.520]   When he convinces the king to kill all the Jewish people,
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.120]   when he stops, when he makes a pole of death
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.200]   for Mordecai to die on and he goes to Haman and kill,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   you'd be like, what is God doing?
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.880]   And yet you couldn't see the full story
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.480]   that God was writing.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.040]   And there was a reversal that came,
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.720]   and none of us can see all the story
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:41.960]   and all the ways that God is writing
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.600]   in the bigger picture of our life
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.960]   and how he's using the fact that you lost that job
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.640]   and you ended up having to move that city
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.440]   or that relationship broke up or your parents ended up,
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   somebody, a loved one ended up dying from cancer
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.760]   or somebody had coronavirus.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.400]   Someone you know has coronavirus.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.360]   You can't see if God is using all of this
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.920]   'cause he's still at work and we can't see the big picture,
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.040]   but we can trust him and he's working it for good.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.120]   Let me show you a parallel.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.480]   Here's what's crazy about the book of Esther.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.320]   And I think the guys have this.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.840]   All throughout the book, you can see,
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.080]   like what is beautiful,
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.840]   it's an incredible piece of literature
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.000]   because there's like a big word for it.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.760]   I won't give it 'cause it'll just confuse people.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.200]   I call it just parallels,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.200]   where it starts with a party full of pagans.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.120]   You remember that the first week
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.680]   where it's like, they're all getting crazy drunk
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.600]   and the king told his first wife,
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.280]   "Hey, come in here, dance naked."
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.520]   And she was like, "No."
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.400]   He's like, "All right, you're no longer my wife then."
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.680]   So it starts with a party.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.560]   It ends with a party with the people of God.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.160]   Starts with a party full of pagans.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.120]   It ends with a party with the people of God.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.120]   It starts with Esther identifying as a Gentile,
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.560]   hiding her Jewishness.
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.880]   And it ends with Jewish people
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.520]   or Gentiles identifying and becoming Jews.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:53.200]   The third chapter has the elevation of Haman,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.560]   the evil person.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.120]   It ends with the elevation of Mordecai.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.680]   It involves a anti-Jewish,
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.560]   every Jewish person has gotta give up their life,
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.840]   is gonna lose their life.
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.880]   And it ends with the Jewish people
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.200]   protecting their lives and being victorious.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.880]   It involves a banquet with Queen Esther
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.000]   and then there's another banquet.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.440]   And it all pivots around this royal procession of Mordecai
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.640]   where he was kind of led throughout the streets.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.840]   Remember that Prince Ali, fabulous he moment,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.360]   where Haman had to walk him around,
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.680]   basically celebrate,
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.760]   this is the guy that King really loves that saved him.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.680]   But in the midst of all that,
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.080]   God took everything messed up and broken
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.880]   and the whole story communicates this.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.240]   And he redeems it and he reverses it
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.320]   and he's at work in the midst of it.
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.480]   And the whole portrait of Esther is a reminder to you
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.240]   and to me that God is at work when I can't see it,
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.300]   when it doesn't make sense,
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.800]   when it doesn't even look like it.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.400]   Like Corona, what is God doing in the midst of Corona?
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.920]   I don't know.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:50.800]   I don't know all the ways,
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.760]   but here's some ways that I do know he's working.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.440]   I do know that last week because of Corona virus,
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:57.240]   somebody stumbled onto the porch live stream
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.760]   and they trusted in Christ, they trusted Jesus.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.080]   And it happened the week before that as well,
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.960]   that people that wouldn't have been listening normally
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.480]   found somehow the stream and God saves their life.
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:08.040]   I know that all over the country,
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.920]   the church is rising up and in community after community,
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.780]   there's Christians who are going around
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.560]   and they're bringing, delivering food
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.160]   to people who have health problems or are elderly,
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.440]   and they're getting a chance to be the body of Christ
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.480]   in a unique way.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.800]   I know that people are searching and looking for God.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.700]   They're in the midst of this going,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.160]   I've been stripped of so much security
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.560]   and they're open to talking about their faith right now.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.600]   So I don't know all the ways,
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.840]   but I do know that he's at work.
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.120]   And those are just some of the ways
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.320]   that he's clearly at work all around us.
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.000]   And I don't know what you're walking through
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.560]   and I don't know what you're facing.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:40.880]   And I don't wanna even pretend
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.080]   that some explanation I could give right now
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.320]   would completely satisfy that.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.840]   But I do know the message of the book of Esther,
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.560]   of the Bible, is that God has promised
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   to work all of those things
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.140]   and to take the most broken, horrific things
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.760]   and bring about good.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.440]   He did it most fully on the cross with Jesus,
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.360]   dying on the cross.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.440]   The worst day in human history
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:07.120]   was the greatest day in human history
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.000]   where Jesus, God himself, who became a man,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.280]   was crucified and died for you and me.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.720]   And that day that was the worst day in history
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.300]   is also the greatest day because it allowed you and I
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.840]   to receive forgiveness of sins
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.440]   by simply putting our faith in him.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.920]   Romans chapter eight, verse 28 to 31 says,
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.400]   and we know that in all things,
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.840]   God works for the good of those who love him,
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.120]   who've been called according to his purpose.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.200]   For those God foreknew,
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.480]   he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son,
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.600]   that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.520]   Those he predestined, he also called.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.240]   Those he called, he also justified.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.800]   Those he justified, he also glorified.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.260]   What then should we say in response to these things?
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.820]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:56.740]   Paul says, no matter what we walk through,
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:59.860]   as a Christian, we know that God has promised
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.620]   he's gonna weave everything to good,
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.620]   everything together for good.
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.160]   Let me say two last things.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.540]   I bought a puzzle recently.
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.860]   It's a 500 piece puzzle.
[00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.140]   I was like, we're gonna do this as a family.
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:13.980]   It's gonna be so fun.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.380]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.640]   And have you ever done like a big puzzle?
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.480]   - Yeah.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.240]   - So I didn't realize how many pieces 500 pieces was.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.160]   - Yeah, it's been a long time.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.240]   - Oh, dude, I was like,
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.960]   I thought a four year old was gonna do it with me.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.920]   Like, this is gonna be so fun.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.000]   We're gonna be bonding.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.360]   And he had no idea.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.520]   It was like this safari puzzle
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.580]   and just the tiny little pieces and where they all fit.
[00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.080]   And so it ended up being like this thing
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.960]   that I will do as a family that I just did
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.040]   because I couldn't let my pride get in the way of like,
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.800]   oh, I'm gonna finish this thing, don't worry.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.120]   And so it became like the thing that I did
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.000]   for like six Saturdays in a row during nap time.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.920]   Just 'cause I couldn't let the gift the best of me.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.360]   And just as I think about that,
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.240]   I was constantly going like,
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.920]   where does this piece fit into the bigger picture?
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:56.240]   Like, how does this all fit together?
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.440]   And if you were to give me like a 5,000 piece puzzle
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.520]   or a 50 million piece puzzle,
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.220]   I would have gone, there's no way I could ever
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.020]   with the lifetime figure it all out.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.720]   God is the one over all of our lives
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.740]   and all the brokenness in our world
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.100]   who has promised that he's taking all these puzzle pieces
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.280]   that we have no idea, no ability to figure out
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.360]   how do they all fit together?
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.880]   And he's promised I'm working them
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.780]   and fitting them in to a bigger picture
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.120]   you can't see right now, but one day you will.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.240]   And one day all the pieces will begin to make sense.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.540]   And in the meantime, you can trust me.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.560]   And the story of Esther was that, hey, you can trust me.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.200]   I'm working and I'm going to bring good about.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.160]   And I don't know who's walking through a situation right now
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.900]   where you just need to be reminded of that.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:47.700]   And you need just a moment where you just declare to God,
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.680]   will you help me to believe that?
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.920]   I don't know where this puzzle piece
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.140]   that I'm holding right now fits and I need your help.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:56.400]   And the God is there wants you to come to him
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.240]   and call on him.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.940]   Finally, just as we finished this book,
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:04.640]   what I think is remarkable about the story
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:07.900]   is there's parallels to Jesus in the story.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.180]   In Luke chapter 24,
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:15.160]   do you know what I'm talking about Luke chapter 24?
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.560]   The road to...
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.840]   - The mask, oh no, not the mask.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.000]   - No, you're close, close.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.920]   Road to Emmaus.
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.760]   - Emmaus.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.280]   - Jesus is on the road to Emmaus and he has a conversation.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.000]   Yeah, it's a weird road.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.480]   And on the road, he's talking with two of these disciples
[00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.160]   and just for the point of being brief, he basically says,
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.000]   hey, everything in the prophets and the old Testament
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.200]   and the scriptures was about me.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.040]   You knew that, right?
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.520]   It was all pointing to the fact that a Messiah would come,
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.400]   he would be crucified, he would give his life
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.040]   and he would save his people.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.160]   All of it, including the book of Esther.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.120]   How does Esther point to Jesus?
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:55.000]   Well, in so many ways, we see Jesus is a better Esther.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.500]   Esther risked her physical life
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.880]   to save her people from physical death.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.920]   Jesus gave his life to save not her people,
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.440]   but all people from eternal death.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.160]   Esther left her poverty for the palace.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:13.560]   Jesus left the palace of heaven for the poverty of earth.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.540]   Esther appealed to the king
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.600]   to rescue her people from destruction.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.040]   Jesus appealed to God, the father,
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.840]   to rescue us from sin's destruction.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.920]   Esther entered the palace uninvited by the king.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.780]   Jesus entered into our world unwelcomed by his people.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.920]   Esther fought against an evil enemy, Haman.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.360]   Christ defeated once and for all
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.800]   the ultimate evil enemy, Satan.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.240]   Esther boldly identified herself with God's people
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.520]   to spare their lives.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:44.320]   Jesus identified himself with humanity to spare our lives.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.840]   Esther saved God's people,
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.820]   spread across one nation in one generation.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.880]   Jesus saved God's people
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.840]   from every nation and every generation.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.480]   The whole book and ultimately the whole story
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.260]   of the Bible points to Jesus.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.920]   And I just wanna share one last time
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.960]   for anyone listening,
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.440]   'cause just like last week and the week before,
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.880]   there's been people who tune in
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.720]   who have never put their faith in Jesus.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.160]   You've never had a moment in your life where you said,
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.960]   "I believe not that I'm a good enough person
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.540]   "to go to heaven, or not that because I'm so bad,
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.700]   "God wouldn't want anything to do with me,
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:19.840]   "but I believe that Jesus on the cross died for my sin.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.600]   "He paid for all of it.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.860]   "And if I'm gonna have a relationship with God,
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.500]   "it's gonna be because I receive his free gift
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.920]   "in giving his life for me to have eternal life."
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.320]   And he was buried and he rose from the dead,
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.600]   and it changed the world.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.120]   It reset the calendar, it redefined existence.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.560]   And it is ultimately not what the story of Esther about alone
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.120]   but what your life and all of life is about.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:42.280]   And God hasn't forgotten you.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:43.120]   He loves you.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.000]   He cares about you.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.720]   He's at work in the midst of all of this.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.840]   And maybe you're sitting right now listening
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   and you're locked in at home and under quarantine.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.480]   And one of the reasons God wants you to be there
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.160]   is 'cause he wants you to know he loves you.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.880]   He gave his life to prove it.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.400]   And if you will trust in that message and in Jesus,
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.120]   you'll receive eternal life.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.160]   And not just experience the God who saved the queen,
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.160]   but God who saves you and I
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.600]   and all people who call on him.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.440]   - So good.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.760]   - So let me pray.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.860]   And then we're gonna do one last worship song.
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:16.860]   Father, thank you that you have been at work
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.700]   since the beginning of time.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.000]   You're working right now all around us.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   And you are the same God who saved the people
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.720]   of the Jewish nation 500 years before Jesus was around
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.480]   through Esther and Mordecai.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.600]   And you're the same God who saved
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.720]   so many of us listening right now
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.360]   by putting our faith in you.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:40.480]   And so I do pray for anyone
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.400]   who's never had that moment.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.360]   Tonight would be their night.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.800]   I pray for friends that are struggling financially
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.780]   and anxious.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.440]   They're anxious because of challenges that they're facing.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.920]   You'd meet them where they're at.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:52.960]   They'd have other believers in their life
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.380]   to generously provide for needs.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.560]   I pray for anyone who's affected directly
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.960]   in terms of their health with the coronavirus
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.440]   that you would meet them right there where they're at.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.200]   They'd have amazing recovery in front of them
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.100]   and the body of Christ caring for them and around them.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.120]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:14.480]   The same God who was at work
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.060]   even when we couldn't see and understand it
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.900]   is still at work even when we can't see and understand it.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.020]   And that he loves us and gave his life for us.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.780]   We love you and we worship you now in song.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.620]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.460]   - Amen.
