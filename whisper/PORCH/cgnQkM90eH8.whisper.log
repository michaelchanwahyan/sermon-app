[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.620]   All right, well, here we go.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.180]   We are wrapping up this series, Fact Check.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.940]   I've got a handful of friends from our staff team tonight
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.260]   that are up here on the stage with me.
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.920]   And let me start by framing up the night
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.620]   with a recent story, actually from yesterday in my own life.
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.660]   I got up work, went home, walked in the door,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.500]   it's early evening, and my son is right by the door
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.980]   and he almost greets me.
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.060]   And the first question that he asked is,
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.180]   "Daddy, do I have to get a spanking?"
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.900]   I have no context for why he's asking me this.
[00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.220]   And this is really the first time
[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.560]   at this moment type of thing.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.900]   He's a four-year-old kid.
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.340]   In fact, here's a picture of him
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.500]   and his sister, Monroe and crew.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.940]   And he's looking at me and he's asking me that.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.220]   And I look at his mom and I say,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.260]   "I don't know, does he have to get a spanking?"
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.820]   And she says, "Yes, we've had a bad day.
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.380]   We've not been listening, we've been arguing."
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.500]   And I told him, "When daddy gets home,
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.180]   you're getting a spanking."
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.140]   Now, this was the first time I'd ever had this experience.
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.940]   Like I'd been on the receiving end of this scenario
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.440]   many, many times where I was the little child
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.780]   or the kid growing up who was told by their mom,
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.100]   "Hey, when daddy gets home, you're gonna get the belt,
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.060]   you're gonna get spanking."
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.460]   And this is Texas people, so we still spank here.
[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.540]   And I was very familiar with just that experience.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.020]   I'd never been on the other side
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.380]   of what it was like to be the dad who was just getting home
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.820]   and what all the different emotions and thoughts
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.180]   kind of go through the head of that father.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.480]   'Cause parents say things,
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.460]   if you remember growing up as a kid
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.420]   where they give you spankings,
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.820]   and they say things where you're like,
[00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.940]   "Is that really true?
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.060]   Is that really how you feel?"
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.220]   'Cause I'm not, honestly, I'm not convinced.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.260]   Where they say things like this, like,
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.220]   "Hey, I have to give you a spanking
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.860]   and this hurts me more than it hurts you."
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.980]   'Cause as a kid, you're like,
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.900]   "I don't know that I believe that.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900]   I'm the only one leaving with red lines on my behind."
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.380]   And I'm the one in tears and you're not.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.440]   But now I'm on my own dad side of this,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.280]   where I'm going like,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.140]   "Oh man, I have to give my son a spanking."
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.460]   And just all the emotions of like,
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.740]   it is true, parents, it's not a fun thing.
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.780]   I mean, Josiah's got kids, he knows what I'm talking about.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.100]   It's not a fun thing to give your kids a spanking.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.180]   I mean, my son, as you saw,
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.060]   like he's in the 98th percentile for height.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.500]   He's scrawny, he doesn't have much padding on his behind.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   Giving spankings, it really is something
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.340]   he doesn't look forward to.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.340]   And as a dad, I hate when consequences for his actions,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.180]   his disobedience, leads to me having to punish him
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.020]   or having to spank him.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.620]   And yet I know that it's a part of raising and growing
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.820]   and it gives us, honestly,
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.720]   it gives me a chance to talk through, you know,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.900]   what it looks like to listen to mommy and daddy
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.760]   and consequences for our actions.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.940]   But it is a hard and challenging thing
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.220]   just as a parent where you have to do it.
[00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.420]   Here's my point.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.820]   Tonight, we're finishing the series
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.020]   where we are covering one of the most difficult objections
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.140]   to Christianity or putting on the stand
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.220]   as we have every single week in Fact Check,
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.400]   these different Christian beliefs.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.900]   And tonight is a really challenging one for a lot of people.
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.340]   And that is how can a loving God allow people to go to hell?
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.740]   If he's a loving heavenly father,
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.140]   just like an earthly heavenly father,
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540]   doesn't enjoy or doesn't like,
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.540]   or doesn't want to give even a spanking to his children,
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.980]   how can a perfect, loving, heavenly father
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.900]   be okay with a consequence
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.380]   for people being eternity away from him,
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.860]   experiencing the horror of hell?
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.580]   Like, how is that possible?
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.260]   Like, is that even really true?
[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.580]   A lot of people like this is where they're like,
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.180]   hey, whatever Jesus is talking about,
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.460]   he can't actually be talking about hell.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.660]   That's probably not actually true.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.580]   A lot of people walk away from their faith
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.440]   because they can't get over this objection.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.540]   So tonight we are putting to a test
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.020]   or checking the fact that God is love.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.560]   He's a loving God and people go to hell.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.420]   So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 16.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.940]   If you have a Bible, you can flip open there.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.640]   If not, it'll be up on the screens,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.380]   but we're gonna cover and walk through
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.160]   some of Jesus's teaching on hell.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.620]   Specifically, I wanna answer three things.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.140]   What is hell?
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.260]   Who will be in hell?
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.300]   And how hell actually shows us the love of God.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.760]   What is hell? Who will be in hell?
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.560]   And how hell shows us the love of God.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.900]   If it's true, if you're skeptical,
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.880]   the answer to tonight's fact check
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.220]   has more significant consequences for you,
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.100]   for our world, for eternity,
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.520]   than any other question you will ever ponder.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.320]   So maybe you're wondering like, ah, just, you know,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.160]   I reject that.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.960]   I at least want you to listen long enough to say,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.560]   hey, if I'm gonna reject Christianity
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   because of what it says about hell,
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.340]   I at least want you to know what it says about hell
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.460]   because it may surprise you.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.780]   So we're gonna be in Luke chapter 16.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.060]   If you have a Bible, I'm gonna start in verse 19.
[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.260]   Jesus is teaching and he starts with a parable.
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.260]   What's a parable?
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.100]   It's just a story that he gives to make up a point
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.760]   or to prove a point.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.500]   Jesus was a masterful storyteller
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.280]   and he's teaching this group of Pharisees,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.340]   which were like this religious group
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.900]   that thought that they could have a relationship with God
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.860]   because they were good people.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.100]   They were like, hey, we're pros on their business card.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.120]   It says professional religious person
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.520]   and that's why God's gonna accept me.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.720]   And over and over, Jesus is like, that's not how God works.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.940]   And he launches into a conversation
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.640]   about heaven and hell with that group.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.580]   And here's what he says.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.720]   He starts and tells this story.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.360]   There was a rich man who was dressed in purple
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.240]   Side note, in this time, someone who was wealthy
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   was often seen as blessed by God.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.280]   So if you were rich,
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.300]   hey, it was because God's blessing was on you.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.940]   If you were poor, it's because God clearly was not for you.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.580]   So this guy, purple, like only the who's who
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.740]   got to wear purple because it was such an expensive thing.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.220]   And so this guy dressed to the nines, very rich,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.460]   culture would have assumed wrongly,
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.500]   oh man, God is clearly for that guy.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.360]   At his gate laid a beggar named Lazarus,
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.180]   covered with sores,
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.660]   longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.520]   Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.400]   Jesus sets up a very clear contrast,
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.480]   super rich, super poor.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.340]   The time came when the beggar died
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.680]   and the angels took him to Abraham's side.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.340]   Abraham's side is just a word that Jesus' audience
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.280]   would have understood as like paradise.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.240]   Father Abraham, kind of founder of the faith, if you will.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.820]   Abraham's side or Abraham's bosom,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.940]   your translation may have, it's just a word for paradise.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.760]   It's like heaven today before the new heavens.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.000]   So it's just basically, he's taken to heaven.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.400]   The rich man also died and was buried
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.120]   in Hades where he was in torment.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.560]   He looked up, Hades, he's in hell.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.160]   He looked up and he saw Abraham far away
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.800]   with Lazarus by his side.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.720]   So he called out to him,
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.180]   Father Abraham, have pity on me.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.180]   Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.160]   and come and cool my tongue
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.340]   because I'm in agony in this fire.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.480]   But Abraham replied, son, remember that in your lifetime
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.800]   you received your good things
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.900]   while Lazarus received bad things.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.440]   But now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.680]   And besides all of this, between us and you,
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.160]   a great chasm has been placed
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.040]   so that those who want to go from here to there cannot
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.800]   nor can anyone cross over from there to us.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.920]   He answered, then father, I beg you,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.360]   send Lazarus to my family.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.880]   For I have five brothers, let him warn them
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.160]   so that they will not also come to this place
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.780]   of torment.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.400]   Abraham replied, they have Moses and they have the prophets.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.440]   Let them listen to them.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.200]   No, father Abraham, he said,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.080]   but if someone comes from the dead to them,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.760]   they will repent.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.200]   He said, if they do not listen to Moses and the prophets,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.760]   they will not be convinced
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.800]   even if someone rises from the dead.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.340]   Jesus is such a brilliant storyteller.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.160]   There's so many, even foreshadowing
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.520]   his own raising from the dead, or he's gonna rise.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.480]   And, but the thing I wanna really highlight
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.820]   is we launch into what does the Bible say about hell?
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.780]   Who's there?
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.480]   And how does it show us the love of God?
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.280]   Is a couple of things that we see inside of this passage.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.440]   Basically, Jesus says, hey, there's a place called heaven.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.560]   There's a place called hell.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   He gives two scenarios, two deaths,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.820]   two different destinations, one of which was hell.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.000]   One of the things that we learn
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.120]   underneath the first point of, hey, what is hell?
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.280]   So just get a big framework
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.000]   for what does the Bible teach about hell?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.720]   It's a place that's absent of anything good.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.140]   Abraham says, hey, you received your good things in life.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.320]   He's bad, now it's the opposite.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.680]   James chapter one, another book in the Bible,
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.120]   in the first chapter says, everything good in life
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.840]   comes from the father of lights.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.240]   Heaven is a place where everything is good.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.300]   Hell is a place where there is total absence
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.440]   of anything good.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.240]   In other words, people will be like, hey, look,
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.160]   I'd rather go to hell with my buddies
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.280]   and have a beer with the devil
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.120]   than be up there playing a harp on a cloud.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.480]   That's because they don't understand what hell is.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.800]   There's no buddies in hell.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.900]   There's no having a beer with the buddies.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.320]   They have a fundamental misunderstanding
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.200]   'cause all of those are gifts and good things from God.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.100]   And those are not present in hell.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.960]   Hell is the absence of anything good.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.160]   Hell is the separation.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.280]   The second thing, just a few things.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.440]   It's a separation from the presence of God.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.140]   Second Thessalonians chapter one, verse eight and nine,
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.320]   the apostle Paul is writing, he's describing hell.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.800]   Here's what he says.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.160]   God will punish those who do not know God
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.280]   and who do not obey the gospel
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.000]   or the good news of our Lord Jesus.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.920]   They will be punished with everlasting destruction
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.520]   and shut out from the presence of the Lord
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.920]   and the glory of his might.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.840]   Heaven by definition is the presence of God.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.180]   Hell is the separation from the presence of God.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.020]   Third thing that you see,
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.480]   and this may be a helpful distinction really quickly
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.720]   is we're told hell is a place of torment, not torture.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.560]   There's a big difference.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.140]   Torture is external.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.060]   Torment is internal.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.640]   If I'm experiencing everlasting torment,
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.560]   there are internal things.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.960]   Maybe it's, hey, I'm covered in shame and guilt.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.680]   I'm covered in anxiety.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.560]   I'm covered in fear.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.360]   I'm covered with loneliness, paralyzing, crippling.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.400]   It's internal.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.920]   This is what it says in the verse.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.440]   In Hades, where the rich man was in torment,
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.920]   torture is somebody on the outside poking you with a stick.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.360]   Torment is an internal experience.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.360]   Generally in the Bible, and most scholars believe,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.760]   over and over, when Jesus says,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.360]   he describes hell as a fire,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.160]   he describes hell as like utter darkness,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.800]   a place where the worm never dies.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.520]   He describes it as gnashing of teeth
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.960]   and some really graphic language.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.880]   And most people believe he's being metaphorical.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.840]   He's saying it's terrible of a place as you can imagine.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.380]   In other words, it's hard to reconcile.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.160]   How could it be total fire and total darkness?
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.500]   Because fire brings light in the dark.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.720]   The point, they're both imagery.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.640]   Most people believe.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.960]   Jesus is just describing a scenario where it's terrible
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.440]   because you're removed from the presence of God.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.320]   And that darkness is total darkness figuratively
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.120]   because there's no presence of God.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.000]   God is light.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.540]   And so whatever it is, torment,
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.040]   and I'm not under or trying to invalidate
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.320]   the horribleness of hell.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.420]   I mean, it's terrible.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.280]   But there's a way in which it involves
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.640]   self-torment on the inside.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.400]   Hell, finally, there's degrees of punishment.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.760]   We don't have time to get into this right now.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.460]   But one other thing just to know about hell
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.240]   is that it involves degrees of punishment.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.180]   Read throughout the New Testament,
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.800]   Jesus over and over repeats,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.280]   hey, based on the severity of someone's actions
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.640]   and the life that they lived,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.600]   there will be corresponding punishments in their life.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.880]   And finally, here's what hell is.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.880]   And this will be really helpful for some of you
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.640]   because I'll be as bold to say,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.640]   I don't know that you want a world without hell.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.080]   Why do I say that?
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.920]   Hell displays the justice of God.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.000]   Hell displays and puts in perspective
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.660]   and puts in account for every action
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.300]   and every evil and every harm
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.220]   and every messed up thing inside of our world.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.060]   It will all be held to account.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.140]   In other words, nobody gets away.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.500]   Even if they get off scot-free,
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.820]   if they committed the crime,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.480]   they will settle every crime
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.540]   and every sin will be paid for in hell.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.780]   Every injustice in our world will be paid for in hell.
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:27.940]   Why do I say that you wouldn't want it?
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.580]   Like you think about the horrific actions
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.700]   that took place in the Holocaust,
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.800]   where millions of Jewish people
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.340]   were shoved into gas chambers
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.780]   and killed and exterminated to imagine that,
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.660]   hey, you know what?
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.860]   And they'll never ever be held accountable.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.900]   They'll never have to give an account
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.620]   for the horrific actions of murdering all those people.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.420]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.220]   And in hell, every crime, every sin,
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:55.180]   all of the cries of our world for justice will be settled.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.340]   Either there or every sin is paid for or on the cross.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.540]   Our world cries for justice.
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.020]   I mean, you look around all the time,
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.800]   people are going, man, when there's injustice,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.180]   something inside of us goes, that is wrong.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.380]   The fact that that person wasn't held accountable
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.280]   or that there's no justice over what they did.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.120]   Why do I say that?
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.480]   This is a picture of a guy
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   that recently has been all over social media or the news
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.720]   and just the public conversation.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.840]   And appropriately so, his name's Ahmaud Arbery.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.080]   And a couple months ago,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.440]   he was out, it seems, jogging in a neighborhood
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.560]   and two people thought he was up to something
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.800]   and they decided to make a citizen's arrest
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.600]   and he lost his life because of the exchange,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.920]   the interaction that took place there.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.840]   It's an unbelievable tragedy.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.440]   Every time a life is lost, it's tragic.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.740]   But then afterwards, there was no investigation.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.640]   The two people who shot him were not took to trial
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.960]   or they weren't put in a jail cell,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.600]   they weren't held accountable.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.960]   And the demand and our world cried out, this is unjust.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   Because there's something inside of us
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.620]   that wants to see justice take place for every action.
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:06.960]   And in hell, every single crime or sin will be settled for.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.680]   There's never a person who traffics sex slaves,
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.880]   rapists, all of the actions of people will be paid for
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.600]   in hell or were paid for on the cross.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.320]   Hell brings about and shows us the justice of God
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.120]   in a world of injustice.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.880]   Okay, so that's kind of a framework of hell.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.060]   Who will be in hell?
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.160]   Which is as important of a question,
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.680]   if hell is true that anyone can ever ask,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.980]   or how can I not be there?
[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.380]   Hell is filled, second point,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.720]   with people who refuse to worship God.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.960]   Those who make up hell are those who reject God,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.520]   the one true God, the God of the Bible,
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.960]   they reject God and they refuse, excuse me,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.320]   they refuse to worship him.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.040]   Romans chapter one says,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.900]   "This is what the wrath of God looks like."
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.280]   People that say, "God, I don't want you in my life,
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.400]   "I don't wanna worship you as God,
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.800]   "I don't want you to be the God of my life."
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.200]   And God says, "I'll hand you over
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.940]   "to letting you be the God of your life.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.180]   "And you're not gonna like where it leads,
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.200]   "but I'll hand you over."
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.080]   That's what it says the wrath of God is displayed
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.440]   or it looks like in Romans chapter one.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.940]   It says this in Romans chapter one, verse 24,
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.720]   after saying, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.740]   "it leads to God handed them over
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.340]   "to the sinful desires of their hearts."
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.980]   God saying, "Man, you wanna be your own God,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.920]   "you can be your own God,
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.980]   "you're not gonna like where it leads."
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.460]   But the person who says, "Hey, I wanna do what I wanna do,
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.260]   "I speak my truth, nobody can tell me what to do,
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.000]   "there is no God out there who I'm confined by,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.980]   "I'll do whatever I want to do whenever I want,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.040]   "and God, I don't want you in my life."
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.680]   God eventually says, "Okay,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.000]   "I'm not gonna force you into heaven,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.840]   "I won't force you in a relationship, and hell is filled
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.320]   "with people who reject God."
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   It's been said, maybe those in hell
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.160]   had the opportunity to even get out,
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.040]   they wouldn't wanna get out.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.740]   They don't wanna be in heaven, 'cause that's where God is.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.560]   And if they didn't worship and didn't love God
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.440]   and didn't wanna do anything with God in this life,
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.880]   why would they want to in the next?
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.680]   And just imagine with me, could it be true
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.240]   that those who make up hell,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.800]   they're not anxious to get out,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.100]   they still don't wanna worship God.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.600]   Lazarus, never in the story, did you recognize this?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.560]   He never says, "Abraham, hey, let me out of here,
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.960]   "please let me out of here."
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.240]   The only thing he asks is,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.640]   "Hey, I want Lazarus to be my errand boy
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.760]   "and go get water for me."
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.840]   He still is so self-centered and self-absorbed,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.960]   all he thinks about is himself.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.660]   So worshiping himself, and expect others
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.160]   to perform acts of worship on himself.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.960]   Could it be that Lazarus, or could it be that the rich man,
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.760]   or could it be that hell is filled with people?
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.040]   Whereas C.S. Lewis said,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.200]   "The door is locked from the inside, they don't want out,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.100]   "they reject God and they will for all of eternity."
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:06.920]   C.S. Lewis said this, where I got the quote from,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.360]   "The door being locked on the inside,"
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.560]   which you know what that means, right?
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.200]   Like when somebody's in their house,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.520]   the door is locked from the inside.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.040]   In other words, people may try to get in
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.140]   or try to get those people out,
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.740]   but they're the ones locking people out.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.700]   He said, "Hell, the damned, are in one sense,
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.740]   "successful rebels to the end," those who will go to hell.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.740]   "That the doors of hell are locked on the inside.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.500]   "They enjoy the forever, forever,
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.740]   "the horrible freedom they've demanded.
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.300]   "I want to do what I want to do,
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.720]   "I don't want any God and I never will."
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.340]   They've rejected him and they're self-enslaved.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.560]   In the end, there are only two kinds of people,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.820]   those who say to God, "Thy will be done."
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.160]   And those who reject God, who he in the end says,
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.580]   "Thy will be done, I will not force you to love me,
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.840]   "I will not force you in a relationship with me,
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.680]   "I will not force myself on you.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.220]   "And I will give you the extent of your freedom
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.200]   "you can choose to reject."
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.520]   The question I think for all of us is,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.760]   are you right now, on that side of the question,
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.840]   are you the person who is saying,
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.480]   "God, thy will be done, you're the God of my life,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.780]   "your will be done in my life."
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.680]   Are you saying, "God, my will be done,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.420]   "I don't want you in my life,
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.880]   "I don't want anything to do with you in my life."
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.820]   Because God, to that person, eventually says,
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.920]   "Thy will be done, I won't force you,
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.960]   "I won't force me into your life
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.620]   "and I won't force you into heaven.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.840]   "You can have separation from me,
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.780]   "if that's what you want, and rejection of me."
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.640]   People often ask me, "Hey, well, what about good people?
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.160]   "What about people who live pretty much good lives
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.000]   "like Gandhi?"
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.100]   Gandhi did a bunch of things.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.800]   You're telling me just 'cause he didn't accept
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.380]   Jesus as God and worship the Bible,
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.620]   or worship the God of the Bible, that Gandhi's in hell?
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.580]   What about good people?
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.720]   The Bible, as crazy as it is,
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   says there is no such thing as good people.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.220]   There was only one who was good,
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.500]   Jesus, in Mark chapter 10, verse 18,
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.020]   this is Jesus speaking,
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.560]   says, "No one is good except God alone."
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.840]   Most of us think, "Well, I feel like I'm,
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.640]   "I'm not perfect, but I'm a pretty good person.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.020]   "I'm better than most on average."
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.580]   By heaven's definition and heaven's standard,
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.180]   it says, "No one is good."
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.540]   That if you've ever lied, if you've ever stolen,
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.300]   you've ever cheated, you've ever gossiped,
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.300]   you've ever spoken harshly
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.440]   or with anger in your heart towards someone,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.220]   all of those, the Bible would say,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.180]   makes you someone who is no longer good
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.300]   by heaven's definition and heaven's standard.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.580]   This is why like good actions
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.820]   and being a good person won't get you in,
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.700]   because biblically, no one is good.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:59.900]   Why does God allow people to reject him?
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.780]   Like, why would he allow anybody to reject him?
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.620]   Like, why would God allow someone
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.780]   to not want to have a relationship with him
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.980]   or to refuse to worship him?
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.040]   Like, why couldn't God just force everybody?
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.240]   Yes, he will not force you to love him.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.040]   He will not force you to be in a relationship with him.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.760]   You can't force love anyways.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.480]   Like, here's an example, like,
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.320]   ladies, you'll resonate with this.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.440]   If a guy comes up to you and, we use Ramsey over here,
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.440]   a guy comes up, he's like, "Hey, Rams, I love you.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.380]   "And I wanna be in a relationship with you.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.740]   "And I want us to date."
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.400]   And this was a good guy, you liked him,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.360]   he's a friend of yours.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.700]   And you're like, "Hey, oh man."
[00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.780]   Let's say his name is Barry.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.020]   You're like, "Barry, I gotta be honest with you.
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.380]   "I've never seen you that way.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.020]   "I really don't have feelings for you.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.360]   "I like you as a friend."
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.140]   Or, "You're like a brother to me."
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.260]   It's like the death nail, Barry, in your heart
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.660]   of that relationship's going nowhere.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.940]   But let's say, you know, he's persistent, he comes back,
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.100]   he's like, "Our story's gonna end
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.140]   "in like the notebook or something.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.360]   "I'm gonna keep going to her.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.960]   "And I, hey, I love you.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.760]   "I wanna be in a relationship with you."
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.560]   And he keeps coming back and he keeps coming back.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.400]   If eventually he comes to you and says,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   "Hey, I love you so much.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.240]   "I'm gonna force you to be in a relationship with me."
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.880]   If anything goes through your mind
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.120]   and you're an average girl, other than,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.940]   "Hey, this guy's crazy.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.020]   "I'm about to get a restraining order.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.160]   "This thing is done.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.200]   "I don't want this person in my life at all."
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.280]   He would be nuts.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.420]   I mean, that type of obsessiveness and forcefulness,
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.460]   if he came by gunpoint and says,
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.120]   "Hey, I love you so much.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.200]   "I'm going to force you to love me."
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.900]   One, you wouldn't love him and it would be terrible.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.280]   God, in the same way, is not gonna force anybody
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.440]   to love him and force them to have a relationship with him.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.400]   He loves people more than any of us will ever love people.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.440]   But just like in that scenario,
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.400]   with a dating relationship,
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.760]   Ramsey would head for the hills and get out of there
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.800]   'cause that guy is crazy.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.440]   So God is not some crazy person
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.880]   who will force you into a relationship
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.960]   and force you into love with him.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.600]   And so those who spend eternity in hell will do so
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.760]   because they have rejected God.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.000]   And just like in that scenario,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.360]   if that guy really did love Ramsey,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.960]   he wouldn't force her into that relationship.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.800]   What would he do?
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.760]   He would leave her alone.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.600]   Say, "You don't want anything?
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.800]   "Or you have rejected me and I do love you.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.300]   "So I'm not gonna force you.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.400]   "I will leave you alone."
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.040]   And God, in the end, is saying,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.780]   "Man, I do love, even those who reject me, I love.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.920]   "But I will not force them to love me back.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.360]   "And I will not force them in a relationship.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.760]   "I will leave them alone."
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.600]   Even if it means for all of eternity.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.800]   Finally, how does hell show us the love of God?
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.200]   As I started saying that hell,
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.640]   hell is separation from God.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.940]   Hell is a place where those who reject God will be.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.100]   By the way, rejecting God doesn't always look like
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.040]   you saying, "God, I reject."
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.940]   It looks like you saying,
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.700]   "I deserve to go to heaven because I'm a good person."
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.480]   If you say that, you have rejected God.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.520]   And I'm about to explain why,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.440]   because God says, like he told the Pharisees,
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.880]   "That's not how heaven works.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.780]   "You don't get in through being a good person.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.680]   "There's no such thing."
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.560]   But that type of person would be rejecting God.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.080]   Now, how can hell show us the love of God?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.160]   'Cause that seems incompatible.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   It's like, "Wow, it's like so harsh, that punishment."
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.880]   How is that show the love of God?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.480]   Because what Jesus did on the cross
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.640]   shows us the length to which God was willing to go
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.200]   so that no one would have to go to hell.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.360]   That God doesn't want anyone to go to hell.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.480]   And he's proven it and showed it,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.280]   and is so passionate about no one spending eternity
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.040]   apart from him, that he was willing to go
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.400]   to the very farthest length possible,
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.640]   which is giving the life of his own son on a cross.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.440]   There is no greater payment that he could have given.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.800]   And he goes to such an extent in order to prove,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.200]   "This is how much you are worth to me."
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.280]   That Jesus was willing to experience separation from God,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.880]   crucifixion on the cross,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.640]   in order that you and I would not have to experience hell.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.160]   He went through, as it were, hell,
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.320]   which is separation from God,
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.400]   so you and I wouldn't have to.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.920]   That's how much you are worth to him.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.840]   Hell shows us how valuable you are to God.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.400]   Now, why do I say that?
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.360]   You remember like in economics, you guys,
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.920]   do you ever take economics?
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.040]   Yeah, you did.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.800]   I know you took economics, this guy.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.680]   Hey, in economics, there's like a principle that,
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.300]   hey, the value of something is determined
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.560]   not by what somebody says arbitrarily it's worth,
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.840]   it's determined by the price someone will pay for it.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.680]   So if I say, "Hey, this phone is worth a million dollars,"
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.900]   it's not worth a million dollars
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.680]   unless someone is willing to pay for it.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.920]   Like the value of a thing
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.860]   is determined by the payment it will bring.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.320]   When it comes to you and it comes to me
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.760]   and it comes to humanity as a whole,
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.440]   how valuable are you to God?
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.280]   The question is,
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.040]   to what lengths is God willing to go
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.720]   in order to pay for you?
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.440]   To pay for the penalty and the consequences of your sin?
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.800]   And the link is the own life of his son.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.020]   There is no farther distance he could have gone.
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.000]   That's how valuable you are to God.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.800]   This past week, it was Mother's Day,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.960]   decided I'm gonna get some flowers.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.060]   I've never gotten the professional flowers.
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.680]   And for my wife, who's mom,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.500]   I looked at the price tag
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.920]   and the price tag from Costco to like Flowers Direct
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.240]   is shockingly different.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.960]   It's like multiples of one another.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.000]   And I was like, "Oh man,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.400]   I don't know if I should do this."
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.220]   And then I was like,
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.640]   "Well, she did give birth to our children.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.880]   Feels like it's worth it."
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.480]   And that's an area, it was worth it to me
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.780]   'cause I was willing to pay the price.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.840]   When God looked at you and he looked at our world,
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.600]   it was worth it to him.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.120]   And he said, "No matter the price, I'll pay it."
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.440]   It's how valuable they are to me.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.840]   Jesus spoke about hell
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.240]   more than anyone else in the Bible.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.080]   Listen to me.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   What if every time that he spoke of it,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.400]   it was because he was a loving God wanting to warn you.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.600]   I don't want you to go there.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.480]   Jesus more than anybody else, if you like Jesus,
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.320]   he's the guy who brings it up over and over and over.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.760]   Half of his parables are about the subject of hell.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.520]   He brings it over or brings it up
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.600]   time and time and time again.
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.620]   And what if it's not because he's some brimstone,
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.880]   angry God out there with a temper tantrum,
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.040]   but he's trying to warn you,
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.080]   I don't want you to experience eternity separated from me.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.780]   And every time it's a loving father warning us.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.680]   If I was asked this room,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.640]   "Hey, is it possible for a loving father
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.080]   to yell at their kids?"
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.040]   What would you say?
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.320]   Ramsey, you're thinking about it?
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   She's still thinking about Barry, I think.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.240]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.720]   No, if I was to say that most, let's just run to it.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.920]   I think a lot of people would say no,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.120]   but the better question would be like,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.640]   what's the context?
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.700]   'Cause there could be a scenario
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.640]   where it is totally appropriate to yell at your kids.
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.100]   Example, my almost two-year-old daughter,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.420]   the other day, two days ago,
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.700]   was running out into the street.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.620]   She was running, headed towards the street.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.460]   And of course, I did what any loving heavenly father did,
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.700]   which is I'm yelling and running after her, come back here.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.220]   She can't see the truck that's coming around the edge
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:08.240]   and what's headed towards her or what she's headed towards.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.300]   And so like any loving father, of course,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.420]   I'm yelling out, warning her.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.820]   Every time you see Jesus mention it,
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.160]   and he mentions it more than anybody else in the Bible,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.940]   over and over and over again.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.060]   It's because he's loving God,
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.600]   who's warning and doesn't want anyone to go there.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.660]   Second Peter chapter three says that God is patient,
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.200]   wanting no one to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.060]   God loves people, he loves you, he loves everyone
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.060]   more than anybody else on the planet does.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.540]   And he wants no one to spend eternity apart from him.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.740]   So of course, we would expect him
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.580]   to bring it up over and over.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.540]   And on that cross, Jesus endured horrific physical pain,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.380]   but even more so spiritual pain,
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.900]   because he was separated from God.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.620]   You may not know this, but it wasn't just being crucified.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.020]   He also, we're told, was forsaken by God,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.660]   as though God almost turned his back.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.300]   The relationship was cut off
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   as he was crucified on that cross.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.580]   Jesus on the cross cried out, "My God, my God,
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.340]   "why have you forsaken me?"
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:17.460]   But their relationship was cut off.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.820]   To have a relationship cut off is always painful,
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.140]   but the degree of the intimacy of that relationship
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.980]   is directly related to the degree of pain
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.820]   when that relationship is severed.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.660]   What do I mean?
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.480]   Let me explain.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.080]   Like if my neighbor's cat dies,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.120]   I'm like, "Oh, that's sad.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.000]   "I didn't really know the cat,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.500]   "and I guess that's kind of a bummer, and there you go."
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.180]   If my neighbor dies, it's way more sad,
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.260]   because we have a much stronger relationship.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.140]   If my wife dies, it's horrifically sad and painful
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.100]   in my life.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.260]   The degree of the relationship is directly related
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.900]   to the degree of the pain in that loss.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.260]   Jesus experienced a level of pain
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.740]   out of that relational cutoff
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.780]   deeper than anything anyone has ever imagined,
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.860]   'cause he was in perfect, eternal relationship
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.960]   with the heavenly Father,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.200]   and then we're told he was made sin for you and me,
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.540]   and took the wrath of God for every sinful action
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.800]   you and I have made, and was separated from God.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.640]   He went through hell so that you and I wouldn't have to.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.440]   Isaiah chapter 53 says this.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.940]   "Jesus was pierced for our rebellion.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.000]   "He was crushed for our sins.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.440]   "He was beaten so that we could be whole."
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.320]   Perfect, innocent God,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.600]   beaten so that you and I could be whole.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.120]   "He was whipped so that we could be healed,
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.600]   "and all of us like sheep have strayed away.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.900]   "We left God's paths to follow our own,
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:56.720]   "yet the Lord laid on him," Jesus, the sins, "of all of us."
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   God loves you to such an extent,
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.200]   this is how it shows the love of God,
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.880]   that he's willing to say, "Man, I love you so much.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.480]   "I'll lay even my own life down.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.960]   "I'll take everything wrong about this world,
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.540]   "every sinful action that you've ever done,
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.820]   "every punishment that you deserve,
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.280]   "that every person out there deserves,
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.800]   "and I'll take all of it, and the full weight of all of that,"
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.300]   the Bible says, "went on Jesus on that cross,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.560]   "where he was crucified."
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.300]   For every look at pornography, every premarital sex act,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.400]   every time that you and I gossiped about another person,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.680]   every time that we were rude, selfish, self-seeking,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.760]   everything messed up, candidly, in my heart.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.720]   You may think like pastors, they get it all together.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.880]   I'm not a good person.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.640]   I honestly, I think I'm better than most people,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.020]   which even reflects that I'm not a good person.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:38.400]   Like there's parts of my heart,
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.240]   I lust after women who are not my wife.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.280]   I have thoughts about how other people
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.520]   don't do enough for me.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.200]   I'm selfish, I get angry.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.740]   I have things in my life that I wish weren't there.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.760]   And I don't deserve to have a relationship with God.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.600]   And despite all of that, on that cross,
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.640]   everything wrong I've ever done in the past, in the future,
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.700]   all of it was paid for by Jesus.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.360]   Because that is how great the love of God is.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.280]   He didn't want anyone to spend eternity in hell.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.480]   And he doesn't want you to spend eternity in hell.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.980]   But the way you can avoid that is by accepting,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.080]   not rejecting God's gift in your life,
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.120]   of dying in the cross, dying in your place,
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.420]   dying for your sins.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.920]   Do you guys know what the name Lazarus means?
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.280]   This is why Jesus is such a fantastic storyteller.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.780]   He's just so brilliant.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.120]   You guys know?
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.020]   It means the one God helps.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.280]   You can go look it up, you can Google it,
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.500]   it's in like some pastor trick, go look it up.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.940]   The name is the one God helps.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.780]   Think about that.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.560]   How brilliant is it?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.360]   Who's gonna spend eternity with God?
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.640]   The one God helps.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.900]   You can't get there on your own.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.160]   You'll never get there on your own.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.960]   Your good actions won't enable you
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.580]   to deserve a relationship.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.280]   The bad things you've done don't keep you out
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.140]   of having a relationship with God.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.420]   It is you accepting the help of God
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.620]   that if I'm gonna have a relationship with you
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.480]   for all of eternity, it's gonna be contingent on you,
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.000]   on what you did in my place,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.380]   on the fact that you paid for everything wrong in my life,
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.260]   everything wrong I've ever done.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.760]   And you said, if I just trust in you
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.140]   that whosoever believes, John 3:16 says,
[00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.480]   "Not whosoever behaves shall have eternal life."
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.940]   It's whosoever believes shall not perish,
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.240]   but have eternal life.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.200]   And that invitation and that offer is extended to you
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.820]   in all of humanity, but you will not ever get there
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.340]   if you just assume, hey, I can get there,
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.820]   I deserve to be there on my own.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.260]   You are not the one God helps.
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:37.440]   Only those who receive the help
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.400]   and the free gift of God in Christ
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.600]   will spend eternity with God.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.680]   If you've never had a moment in your life
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.120]   where you trusted in that gift, tonight is your night.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.280]   You're not saved by saying magic words of a prayer.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.000]   A prayer is only something where you go to God
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.760]   and people will be like, did you pray the prayer?
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.160]   A magic prayer or saying doesn't save you.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.540]   The prayer just reflects a belief
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.640]   and a posture of your heart that goes,
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.120]   man, I think I'm a sinner.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.260]   I think I'm messed up.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.620]   I'm not a good person, God.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.820]   But I believe that you gave your life on the cross.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.820]   You died for me, despite the fact that I didn't deserve it.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:18.560]   And I trust not in how many times I go to the church
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.000]   or go to church or read my Bible or good things that I do,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.280]   but only in what you did.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.880]   You're the only reason why I could have eternal life.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.880]   I'm trusting only in that, God.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.380]   And I believe that because of what you did for me,
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.520]   I stand with you and I don't have to worry
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.960]   about where I'm gonna spend eternity
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.200]   'cause it'll be with you.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.080]   In your own way, acknowledging I'm a sinner,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.820]   God, you loved me so much, you died for me.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.440]   And I believe that what you did,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   dying in my place and rising again from the grave
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.900]   has given me forgiveness of sins.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.280]   It's not good people in heaven and bad in hell.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.320]   It's forgiven people in heaven and everybody else in hell.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.480]   And that invitation is offered to you tonight,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.520]   wherever you are in the quiet of your room,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.360]   maybe you're with other people,
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.480]   you just need to step outside and go, do I believe this?
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.660]   Do I believe this?
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.760]   And in doing so, if you decide to receive that free gift
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.000]   forever, you don't have to wonder where you stand with God.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.800]   You don't have to wonder where you go when you die.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.880]   And if you haven't, you don't have to wonder
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.000]   candidly either, because you're gonna spend eternity
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.840]   apart from God, 'cause you're rejecting God's help,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.980]   God is savior.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.200]   And the reason why Jesus came,
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.360]   in conclusion, hell is a place where the justice of God
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.900]   is revealed.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   Those who reject the free gift of God and reject God
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.300]   will be there.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   And hell displays how loving, how much God loves you and me
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.280]   and what he was willing to do,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.080]   the lengths he was willing to go to.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.740]   Let me close by saying this.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:58.520]   There was a guy, give a quick history example
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.480]   that kind of illustrates what Christianity teaches.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.520]   His name was George Wilson.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   He was a guy in the late 1820s, around 1829 in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.480]   He robbed a mail carrier.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.600]   So he decided to go up, a federal mail carrier,
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.680]   he robbed him, he ended up killing the mail carrier.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   He was captured and he was put on trial.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.240]   He was convicted and he was found guilty of a federal crime
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.080]   and he was sentenced to death by execution,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.720]   to hanging by execution.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.120]   And he's sitting in jail and it's George Wilson.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.560]   And some of his friends, he was well-connected.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.040]   He had people in high places.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.720]   They went to the president of the United States.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.680]   It's a true story, you can look it all up.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.040]   And they said, "Hey, George Wilson is in jail.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.920]   "Can you issue him a presidential pardon?"
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.160]   Presidential pardon is the only way
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.360]   if there's a federal crime
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.560]   that you're getting out of that sentence
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.320]   without paying for your crime.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.600]   So they go to him and for whatever reason,
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.640]   Andrew Jackson decides,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   "I'm going to extend a presidential pardon to George Wilson
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.560]   "so that he wouldn't have to die."
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.960]   George is told and he's brought to court
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.320]   and they say, "The president has extended this pardon to you."
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.960]   And George says, "I don't want his pardon."
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.360]   We're not really told why.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.500]   It's kind of a mystery.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.560]   Some people think it's because
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.680]   he didn't want to acknowledge guilt
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.520]   or acknowledge that I was guilty of that crime,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   or he just wanted to kind of like stick it to the man
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.040]   and I don't care about any of you guys,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   but he didn't accept, or he says, "I don't accept it.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.160]   "I don't even care."
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.160]   And this forced a question in the court where they go,
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.700]   "What do you do if there's a presidential pardon
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.240]   "that's issued?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.400]   "Can someone reject a presidential pardon?"
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.440]   And it led to another court,
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.400]   like they ran it up the courts.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.020]   And eventually it went to the United States Supreme Court.
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.560]   There's United States versus Wilson.
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.080]   It's a classic court case.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.040]   If you went to law school, you may have been familiar with it.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.240]   And here's what the Supreme Court ruled.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.120]   This is Chief Justice John Marshall.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   "A pardon is an act of grace
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.960]   "proceeding from the power entrusted
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.320]   "with the execution of the law."
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.680]   So basically it's an act of grace from the president.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.400]   "But its delivery is not completed
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.140]   "without acceptance of that pardon.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.480]   "It may be rejected by the person to whom it is given,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.200]   "and we have no power in a court to force it on them."
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.560]   Here's the Supreme Court ruled.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.580]   "A president cannot force someone
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:18.160]   "to accept a presidential pardon."
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.400]   So George Wilson can choose to reject it.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.880]   And a pardon, if it is not accepted, it is not applied.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.120]   George Wilson was executed by hanging
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.760]   because he decided, "I reject that pardon."
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.160]   The Bible teaches something very similar.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.640]   God has extended a presidential,
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.420]   a divine pardon to all people everywhere.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.840]   If they're willing to accept the free gift
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.160]   that Jesus died in their place.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.840]   In many ways, it's a far greater pardon than that one.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.600]   'Cause the president in that scenario
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.720]   just writes up a pardon and says,
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.540]   "Hey, you're off the hook."
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.360]   In the Christian scenario, or what happened scenario,
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.280]   is that God said, "Hey, somebody has to pay for this sin.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.740]   "And I'm not gonna force it on you.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.160]   "I'm willing to extend a pardon to you
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.400]   "because I'm going to crush my son on a cross
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.940]   "and pay for all of the sins of humanity
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.720]   "and all of the sins of the world around us."
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.040]   And in that, he extended to every person a divine pardon.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.440]   And the choice is yours.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.420]   Are you going to accept it?
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.280]   Because if you do not, it will not be applied.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.880]   But it's not because it's not extended by God.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.340]   Just like it was by the president.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.760]   It was extended.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.600]   Just wasn't accepted.
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   Every person listening right now
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.520]   and just in the world in general
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.480]   has been extended a divine pardon by God,
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.660]   saying, "I'm paying for it.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.180]   "I've paid for it.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.640]   "But you have to accept it or it will not be applied."
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.520]   He's a loving God.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.840]   He doesn't want anyone to go to hell.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   And he was willing to go to such great lengths
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.800]   to go through hell in and of itself, if it were,
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.160]   so that you and I wouldn't have to.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.980]   Let me pray.
[00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.560]   (gentle music)
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.100]   Father, thank you that,
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.860]   thank you, seems like silly, honestly,
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:02.100]   that you would endure
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.700]   eternal death in our place
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.220]   and suffering at a level that none of us will ever know
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:17.620]   so that all of us could spend eternity with you.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.900]   (gentle music)
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.220]   Father, I pray for anyone listening right now
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.940]   who's never trusted in what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.980]   They still think they're good actions or they're bad actions
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.980]   or the way they can have a relationship with you,
[00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.500]   that you would pierce through that fog
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.020]   and let them see it as a lie.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.540]   That is a lie from hell.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.820]   That good people go to heaven, bad people go to hell.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.440]   It is only forgiven people.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.860]   And the only way to get that forgiveness
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:48.660]   is by receiving the free gift of what you did on the cross.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.100]   We're unworthy, God, and yet you love us,
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.960]   gave your life for us, you paid it all for us.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:58.140]   Would you allow people tonight,
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.700]   for the very first time, to trust in that?
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.660]   And would you allow those of us who have
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.300]   to walk in light of that, to share our faith
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.000]   in light of the fact that everyone around us
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.500]   will spend eternity somewhere?
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.740]   And it doesn't have to be apart from you.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.020]   Father, we love you.
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.420]   We praise you, that you paid it all.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   We worship you in song, amen.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
