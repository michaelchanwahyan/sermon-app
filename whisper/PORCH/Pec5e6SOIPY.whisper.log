[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:26.560]   - Well good evening everyone.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.460]   Not only that's right here in this very room,
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.420]   but I just found out today that there are 11 groups now.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.720]   We're up to 11 groups that are meeting
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.880]   in other parts of the world right now together.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.180]   Not to mention everyone who's listening individually,
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.980]   whether you're driving, walking,
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.200]   wherever you are right now,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.580]   listening to The Porch and being a part of this thing.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.420]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.240]   My name is Garrett.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.500]   I get a chance to help out on staff here.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.520]   I was at The Porch Fort Worth
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.900]   for the last four amazing years,
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.740]   so special shout out to my Fort Worth fam.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.860]   I'm gonna be helping out
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.780]   with the Awaken Conference going forward.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.620]   If you don't know what Awaken is,
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.540]   you should press pause right now and go to awaken.live.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.680]   That's not for you right here in the room,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.800]   but if you're online or you're listening, awaken.live.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.000]   It's gonna be amazing next May.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.260]   You can check it out.
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.160]   Let's get started here tonight.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.400]   Hey, are any of you diehards ready for Christmas already?
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.260]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.440]   I'm offended at all of you.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.620]   I think Christmas belongs between the day
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.900]   after Thanksgiving and December 31st.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.660]   (audience cheering)
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.100]   I'm just gonna, I know I just divided the room terribly,
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.220]   but however you feel about the upcoming holiday,
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.700]   whether it should be celebrated now
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.820]   or in its proper place, just so you know where I stand,
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.620]   however you feel about that,
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.300]   one thing is going on right now,
[00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.020]   and it is that little people, children,
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.980]   are gonna be finding out
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.860]   that Santa Claus is actually not real,
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.280]   and that's very unfortunate.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.380]   For some of you, sorry to let you know in this moment,
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.280]   I know, for some of you,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.920]   this is like your least favorite childhood memory
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.940]   where you found out that something you thought
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.180]   was so real and so important was actually a myth,
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.020]   like it wasn't real.
[00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.480]   Some of you had this done really well.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.980]   You had like a gentle parent.
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.660]   You know, they like sit you down,
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.500]   and they're like, "Listen, honey,
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.860]   "we need to tell you something because we love you."
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.420]   You know, and some people break it to you
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.060]   really, really well, and then some of you,
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.940]   more likely, had a know-it-all classmate
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.980]   whose parents had had that meeting with them,
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.320]   and then they come in and just crash your worldview
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.260]   right there with just no sympathy about it whatsoever,
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.420]   but however you found out about it, it is never fun.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.420]   It is never fun to believe that something is real,
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.200]   that something's worthy of your hope,
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.760]   that something is worthy of your trust and your pursuit,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.940]   and then all of a sudden, it kind of starts to crash down.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.060]   I had it happen to me nearly recently
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.140]   after I bought my girlfriend, now wife,
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.980]   a diamond ring to propose.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.480]   One of my friends said, "Hey, I bought my wife's diamond ring
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.980]   "from the same place, and I found out it was fake."
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.500]   I said, "Oh, no, Santa Claus is real.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.740]   "You better believe it.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.100]   "There's no way that," you know, and it turned out,
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.420]   thankfully, that it was actually not true,
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.260]   but it shook me.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.700]   You know, there's something disorienting and kind of crazy
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.020]   about feeling like, oh, man, the thing I thought
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.300]   was so real is actually a myth,
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.080]   and there is a myth in our culture,
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.420]   a very well-known myth that our society
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.800]   was actually built on, and it is this myth,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.900]   that more money equals more happiness.
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.140]   The truth is is that this myth
[00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.820]   that more money equals more happiness
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.780]   is older than the songs we grew up with, though.
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.900]   Our entire society was actually based on this idea,
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.620]   that the more happiness you have,
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.340]   or the more money you have, that your happiness
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.440]   is actually gonna increase with it,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.420]   that life, liberty, and the pursuit of what?
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.540]   - Happiness. - Is a way of life,
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.020]   and make no mistake about it, we would say
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.140]   that money is intricately tied to happiness,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.660]   and maybe the graph, if you could draw it,
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.620]   would look a little something like this,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.260]   that relationship between these two things
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.740]   would work a little bit like that,
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.580]   that the farther you push that way into money,
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.860]   the more money you can get, the more paycheck you can get,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.820]   that your happiness will climb with it,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.980]   and what's interesting is that our society
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.100]   has actually succeeded at that.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.000]   I mean, if you look at the aggregate culture
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.400]   of the United States as it relates
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   to the rest of world history,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.120]   yes, there are parts of America that are disadvantaged,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.800]   no, not everyone in America seems to have
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.960]   the same fair opportunity that we boast about,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.520]   however, if you look at the numbers
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.860]   compared to the rest of the world,
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.360]   we are in the middle of a 200-year experiment,
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.840]   and we are richer than any society that's ever lived.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.280]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.920]   None of us feel rich.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.860]   We don't seem to feel it.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.700]   You're like, where is it?
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.200]   I don't have it, but none of us feel it,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.080]   but the truth is that at a national level,
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.100]   at a societal level, we are the richest society
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.380]   in the history of the world.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.280]   However, we're also the most depressed.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.760]   We're the most disillusioned.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.900]   We're the most disappointed.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.980]   It's as if instead of pushing farther out here,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.980]   farther than any society has ever gone before,
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.440]   instead of finding some kind of permanent happiness
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.840]   or contentment, all we find is another exhausting goal.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.780]   We're the most medicated, the most mentally medicated
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.500]   country in the history of the world.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.340]   To the rest of the world,
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.660]   America might look like Disneyland,
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.020]   but we're the kids who are sad at Disneyland,
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.420]   which will show you that not everything
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.380]   that you need psychologically can happen
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.180]   through what you can have materially.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.420]   It's as if somewhere out here,
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.780]   even though we've pushed this experiment,
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.840]   this American dream as far as it can go,
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.720]   it seems that there's not happiness out here,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.020]   but as compelling as that might be,
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.420]   for some of you, I know that this happens closer to home.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.980]   For some of you, this pursuit of money broke up your family
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.420]   because a parent decided, you know what,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.220]   more money is gonna equal more happiness,
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.540]   and the truth is they took a job
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.220]   or they took a place where they had to travel
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.540]   and it didn't lead to more happiness,
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.580]   at least not for you.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.620]   For some of you, this is the thing
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.180]   that's kind of been the steering wheel of your life.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.620]   You know, this decides where you go.
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.620]   You know, where is the money?
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.620]   Where's the paycheck?
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.860]   For some of you, this is how you ended up
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.860]   in a Texas city, you know?
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.220]   Your friends are like, why'd you go there?
[00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.780]   Was there mountains?
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.220]   No, no mountains, you know?
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.220]   Was there a beach?
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.420]   Not, no, not really, you know?
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.820]   Well, why are you there?
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.780]   And you're like, well, if I'm,
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.740]   you wouldn't say this out loud,
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.500]   but the truth is you're here to start your empire
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.140]   and make money and that is gonna make you feel good inside.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.620]   The pursuit of money and happiness
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.460]   is naturally linked in our mind,
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.140]   and what I wanna do is I just wanna shoot you straight.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.980]   I have to admit, I am susceptible to buying into this.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.860]   I'm not immune to this.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.140]   It's not like you get into ministry
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.660]   and you just want money less.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.980]   You may have money less,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.980]   but you will not want money less
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.820]   when you get into ministry.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.460]   That is a normal part of human existence.
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.020]   I have to, I just wanna admit that up front.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.260]   I don't wanna be a hypocrite up here.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.140]   I like opportunity that money offers.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.400]   I like freedom that money offers.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.380]   I like stuff.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.820]   I especially tend to like vacations.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.140]   I mean, I can get into a vacation in a hurry,
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.300]   and my wife's like, what happened to the bank account?
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.140]   I'm like, I don't know.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.960]   I blacked out.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.800]   We're going to Mexico.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.620]   Praise God, you know?
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.460]   It's gonna be great.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.500]   And so I just wanna tell you,
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.340]   I'm not totally free from this.
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.180]   I don't profess to be,
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.620]   but what I do wanna do is I wanna introduce you
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.060]   to two different people in the scripture tonight.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.060]   They represent two perspectives
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.900]   about how happiness and money relate.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.540]   They represent two future options for you.
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.020]   And I believe scripturally, you can be the judge.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.220]   I believe scripturally that you are actually going to turn in
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.660]   to one of these two people that you're gonna meet tonight.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.180]   Jesus interacted with them.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.980]   And as you see them face to face,
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.820]   you may see a little bit of yourself.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.580]   And here's the thing.
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.500]   None of us get to pick our list of options.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.400]   I do believe biblically, and you can be the judge,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.220]   that we get to be one of these two people.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.220]   We are going to turn into one of these people.
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.620]   We are going to adopt their perspective about money.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.940]   One of the two.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.420]   We can't choose the list of options,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.340]   but we can choose our choice.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.420]   We can make our decision.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.820]   And so I'd love for you to meet these people.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.140]   And the first is found in the book of Mark.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.340]   So Mark is an accurate biography of Jesus.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.340]   It's a story of Jesus where Mark saw via an eyewitness
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.160]   exactly what Jesus had said and done
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.200]   and records these conversations from Jesus's life.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.680]   So here comes option number one.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.520]   I'm giving to you straight up.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.480]   Option number one, you can do this with your life.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.760]   You can love money, be moral.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.280]   You know, a pretty good person, not a bad person.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.880]   You can love money, be moral, and miss Jesus.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.040]   That can happen.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.560]   You can love money, be moral, and miss Jesus.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.280]   Let's take a look at this guy who embodies that.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.160]   Mark chapter 10, verse 17.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.600]   It says, "As he, Jesus, was setting out on his journey,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.620]   "a man," we would find out later in the story,
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.300]   "a very rich young man,"
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.640]   the guy who has the tax bracket you wanna be in, okay?
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.920]   "A very rich young man comes out and kneels before Jesus
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.060]   "and says," moral language, good teacher,
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.000]   "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.100]   So this is a moral man.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.020]   And we find out later in the story that he's rich
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.820]   and he wants to be a good guy.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.460]   I mean, do you hear this in his question?
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.260]   I mean, he walks up to Jesus, title of respect, good teacher.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.760]   "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.260]   Comes up to a good teacher, asks a good question.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.620]   And the answer, of course, if you know the scripture
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.700]   and you know the character of Christ is not to be good,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.920]   but to trust in a good God.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.600]   That's how you get eternal life.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.440]   But Jesus responds playfully right here.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.820]   He says, "Why do you call me good?
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.040]   "No one is good except God."
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.760]   It's as if he's saying,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   "If you're gonna call me good, then I must be God.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.020]   "Don't call me good, but don't call me God.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.220]   "Why would you call me good if I'm not God?"
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.300]   And he says, "You know the commandments,
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.800]   "don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   "be good, be good, be good, be good."
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.780]   In other words, Jesus is saying,
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.540]   "Look, if I'm not God to you,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.680]   "if I'm not God to you,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.380]   "you're gonna have to be really godly.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.560]   "And if I'm not good for you,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.760]   "if I'm not gonna be your goodness for you,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.700]   "you're gonna need to be really good."
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:41.460]   And he says, "Teacher, I've kept all these from my youth."
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.360]   This is a rule following person right here.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   This is not the guy who would have followed you to the party.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.020]   This is the guy who would have avoided
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.260]   and looked down on you and been proud of it.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.660]   Some of you know this guy.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.360]   Some of you might be this guy.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.100]   This is the person who could not be swayed morally.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.980]   He is locked in, he is an obedient,
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.180]   and he believes he's doing his best,
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.540]   but he knows something is missing.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.660]   In Jesus, it says, "Looking at him loved him."
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.640]   He loved him.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.660]   Jesus looks at this young, rich guy
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.140]   who thinks he's a good person, and he loves him.
[00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.100]   And look what he does next.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.200]   He puts his finger right on the one thing
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.540]   that this good guy loves more than Jesus.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.200]   He looks right at him, knows everything about him.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.220]   That's the thing Jesus can do that we can never do.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.100]   It's not like we shake hands and look at someone
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.880]   and love them and know everything about their heart.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.420]   We don't do that, we don't have the ability.
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.020]   But Jesus, looking at him, loves him,
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.020]   and he knows all of his fears, he knows all of his doubts,
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.180]   he knows all of his insecurities,
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.580]   and he knows all of his ambitions,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.340]   and he knows all of his loves and all of his worships.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.380]   And Jesus looks at him and loves him enough to do
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.540]   what he loves all of us enough to do,
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.020]   which is to go straight to the top of what he loves
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.660]   and say, "Hey, it's gotta be me instead of that now."
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.860]   So this is what he says.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   You lack one thing.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.240]   Go and sell all that you have and give to the poor,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.920]   and you will have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.040]   Give away everything you have.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.540]   Let it go.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.920]   Some of you are like, "I'm at the wrong church.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.260]   "I can't do this, this is too much.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.980]   "I can't let go of everything that I possibly own."
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.840]   But Jesus looks at him and he knows
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.120]   that this is what the guy loves.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.200]   He's attached to this.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.640]   Jesus is saying, "Cash does not rule everything around me.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.780]   "I rule everything around me, and I love you,
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.800]   "and I want you with me if you come with me."
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.400]   So let go of the old love.
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.260]   Let go of the old driver of your life,
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.880]   the thing that has all your affections, which is your money.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   Let go of that and come with me,
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.620]   and you'll be rich, really rich.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.720]   The truth is Jesus does not always do this.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.560]   This is not a rule.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.860]   This is not like, you know, some of you are like,
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.700]   "Whew."
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.800]   This is not like the thing that everyone has to do
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.200]   as far as their money is related.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.640]   But what everyone does have to do
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.180]   is they have to let Christ be the number one love
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.400]   of their life, not just a good teacher,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.260]   a master, and a treasure.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.720]   And Jesus walks right up to this guy and says,
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.440]   "Hey, you got a lot of treasure, but it ain't me,
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.100]   "and it needs to be me, and you can come with me,
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.520]   "and I wanna replace that false love you've been chasing."
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.920]   And here is his reaction, and I want you to see it
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.400]   because it's a real option for you.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.260]   It's a real danger for you.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.400]   It says, "Disheartened by this saying,
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.080]   "he went away sorrowful."
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.600]   Sad, your translation might say he walked away sad
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.880]   because he had great possessions.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.240]   You feel how distorted that is?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.840]   Like, can you imagine being face-to-face with Jesus?
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.160]   You're face-to-face with God in a bod, you know,
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.240]   in a human being, face-to-face.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.880]   And he looks at you, and he loves you,
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.640]   and he says, "Hey, you can have me,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.880]   "and you'll be wealthy forever,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.440]   "or you can hang on to the stuff you got right now."
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.920]   And this guy is like, he's like sad, he's sorrowful,
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.120]   he's confused because he has so much wealth,
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.120]   he can't get out of it.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.960]   You see this guy?
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.880]   He's like God on golden handcuffs.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.520]   It's like, "Ah, I'd love to follow you, Jesus,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.840]   "but I got so much stuff, I can't give it up."
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.720]   He's stuck by his own wealth.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.600]   He's hooked.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.440]   He's in a chase.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.280]   He's on a treadmill.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.400]   He can't get enough.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.160]   And he gets an invitation.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.240]   Can you imagine the privilege?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.400]   God coming all the way to earth
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.840]   to invite you to follow him,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.760]   and instead of saying yes, he gets led away
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.520]   by his loves, by his passions, by his worship,
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.440]   by what he wanted.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.720]   And you go, "Well, who would do that?"
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.360]   And the answer is that you might.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.560]   People do it all the time.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.200]   It just might be a little bit less abrupt, you know?
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.600]   It might not be the first thing that comes,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.240]   it might not be like as drastic
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.040]   as like a face-to-face conversation
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.280]   where Jesus dramatically says,
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.880]   "Come with me," and you say, "No, thanks."
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.720]   It may not be that.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.440]   It just may be like a more subtle series of trades down.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.560]   Like if you choose a job,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.960]   and this is your thinking when you choose a job,
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.160]   if it's like, "What is the paycheck?"
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.680]   And you're about to sign on the dotted line,
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.880]   but you forgot to hear the job description
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.440]   'cause you were excited about the paycheck,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.600]   something's broken there.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.800]   Like something's distorted.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.880]   Your decision-making has been tweaked a little bit
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.000]   by the love of money.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.000]   And if you like leave a job because you're like,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.240]   "Oh, $5,000 more.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.060]   "Like I don't need, I don't, you know, say no more.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:26.900]   "I'm in."
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.060]   Like if you are bouncing around the workforce in that way
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.800]   is because something has to be broken.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.520]   If that's the only factor being considered,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.720]   if it's the lead factor being considered, something is off.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.280]   And unfortunately, it doesn't just warp our decision-making
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.460]   as it relates to our jobs.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.880]   The love of money distorts our decision-making
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.560]   as it relates to who to date, who to be with,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.720]   how to choose a man, how to choose a woman.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.120]   Like you know you're under the influence
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.520]   of the love of money if like he's a two
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.040]   and then he's a law student and he's like baseline seven.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.760]   You know, he just went like from here
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.560]   and it's like, boom, he just went really, really high.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.400]   Like that's how you know something is off.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.760]   Guys, if like for you, if you're like,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.440]   "I," you know, if the thing that is like most important
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.080]   to you is like you wanna be a power couple
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.480]   and you're just like, you're looking for this girl
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.080]   who's got this long, amazing resume
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.960]   and it's like amazing like work life
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.440]   and her accomplishments and all this,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.620]   something, and not her character, you know,
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.440]   something might be off there.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.620]   And we're not immune to this in church.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.220]   You know, we'd like to dream that if we're following Jesus,
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.980]   that we, if you're in church, if you're in Christ in any way
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.120]   and you're walking with him, we'd like to imagine
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.500]   that we're kind of immune to that, but we're not.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.780]   Like our mindset can get so twisted and dark.
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.480]   In fact, let's take this another level deeper just for fun.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.900]   So if it just so happens that you're in this way of thinking
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.340]   and I know everyone's not, so please save the email.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.020]   I promise I know everyone does not think
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.780]   what I'm about to do, but some people,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.320]   if you are in the struggle right now
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.780]   and you believe that money equals happiness,
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.780]   you might be tempted to think of men this way.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.620]   You might be like, okay, look, I'm a Christian,
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.420]   so I need this dude to be spiritual.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:08.620]   But I also need to be provided for,
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.660]   so I need someone who is rich.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.860]   You might say the word stable because it sounds better,
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.140]   okay, but you need someone who is rich, okay?
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.540]   So basically, you got your spiritual factor
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:19.800]   and you got your rich factor.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.780]   All right, now here's how you know
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.180]   if your thinking is broken.
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.060]   You got the guys down here that are neither spiritual
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.060]   nor rich and that is the forbidden zone.
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.060]   You just, no chance, you just don't even fly there, okay?
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.900]   And then up here, you got the guys who are spiritual
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.140]   but not rich and we call that the friend zone.
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.660]   These are the guys, yeah,
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.660]   these are the guys that you ask for advice from.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.540]   These are the guys that you hang out with
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.580]   but they're not really an option for you,
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.580]   you know what I mean?
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.700]   And you call it chemistry and stability
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.580]   but it's that, all right?
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.180]   But here's my very favorite thing
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.420]   about this way of thinking.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.020]   This is my very favorite thing about this graph.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.860]   It seems that there's a white space out here
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.100]   that once you are rich enough,
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.780]   it no longer matters how spiritual you are.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.060]   You just live out here and we'll work with you, okay?
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.580]   It's like, oh, he's heard of Jesus.
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.260]   I'll invite him to church, I'll pray for him, you know?
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.860]   We'll bring him more into my family
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.740]   than me going into his.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.500]   Like we'll find some way to make this work, you know?
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.300]   And look, I know it's playful and fun
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.000]   and by the way, again, just wanna repeat,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.920]   I am well aware that not everyone in here
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.880]   is thinking that way.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.300]   But if you are stuck in thinking
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.780]   that money leads to happiness,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.580]   this is just one little example
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.280]   of how you're gonna make decisions.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.680]   The golden handcuffs of you chasing wealth
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.100]   or even wanting wealth will take you away
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.840]   from wisdom in your life.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.680]   It's not by accident that the scripture says,
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.960]   "Wisdom is better than jewels
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.560]   "and all that you may desire cannot compare with her."
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.120]   The desire for wealth will drag you away
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.280]   and some of you go, I am not rich.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.720]   This is passing me by because I am not rich.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.320]   Well, here's the truth.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.420]   This is about affections, not possessions.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.320]   See, you can miss Jesus in one of two ways.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.800]   The world can give itself to you
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.560]   or the world can withhold itself from you.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.360]   Either way, if you love the world more than Christ,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.180]   you're done.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.800]   Christ wants better for you than this.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.840]   If you want a better option, you should.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.660]   And there is one.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.400]   Here it is.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.720]   Invest money.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.760]   Be joyful.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   And have Jesus.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.600]   Invest money, be joyful, and have Jesus.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.200]   You know, the previous guy, the very next sentence,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.840]   it said, Jesus said, "How hard it will be
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.920]   "for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God."
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.480]   Because he knows how this messes with our hearts.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   But there's another option.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.680]   Invest money, be joyful, and have Jesus.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.500]   I want you to see it.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.960]   This is a little metaphor that Jesus uses
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.140]   to introduce us to what the right reaction to Christ is,
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.480]   what the real reaction, not just financially,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.680]   but in the heart is.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.200]   And he introduces this little two-sentence metaphor
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.080]   in Matthew chapter 13.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.580]   And he introduces you to a different perspective,
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.040]   a different option, a different possibility for you,
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.320]   for your future, for your affections,
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.200]   for your heart, for your priorities.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.360]   And it goes like this.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.560]   Jesus says, "The kingdom of heaven."
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.280]   So rather than Jesus interacting on this one,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.620]   he's just gonna explain a few things.
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.240]   He says, "The kingdom of heaven
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.840]   "is like treasure hidden in a field."
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.400]   Like treasure, like something economically valuable.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.160]   Hidden in a field, hidden from you all those years
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.960]   when you never were able to find it.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.040]   And it says, "One day a man found it."
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.880]   He wasn't looking for it.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.480]   "One day a man found it, and he hid it again.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.020]   "And then in his joy, he went and sold all he had,
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.360]   "and he bought that field."
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.340]   So the kingdom of heaven, so Jesus and all that he offers,
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.900]   the chance to be with God and experience
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.740]   not just life in heaven,
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.200]   but abundant life right here on earth,
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.280]   all of that is like something valuable
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.640]   that's hidden from you for a long time,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   but then you have the chance to find it.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.120]   And when you find it, this man, this example,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.680]   doesn't walk away sad.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.980]   It says, "He went into his life,
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.500]   "and he made really expensive arrangements
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.400]   "to arrange himself around the new priority,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.360]   "and he was happy about it."
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.480]   He was glad about it.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.640]   He felt like he won.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.560]   So what's the lesson about money from this guy?
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.220]   One, no amount of money is worth as much as Jesus
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.360]   and all that he offers.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.280]   No amount of money.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.640]   If you think there's some amount of money,
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.080]   if you're like, "There are enough zeros somewhere
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.200]   "to satisfy me," there are not.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.880]   There are not enough zeros out there
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.800]   at the end of a paycheck, at the end of an inheritance.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.400]   There is no such thing as any amount of money
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.640]   that is worth as much as Jesus.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.520]   This guy just wandering along, he goes,
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.820]   "Oh, Jesus says it's like this."
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.880]   It's like if you're wandering along,
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.820]   and you found a treasure, and you go,
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.260]   "Well, this is where the treasure is,
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.780]   "so I'm gonna go give up everything I have
[00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.320]   "so that I can have this."
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.600]   And it's as if he's weighing the scales in his mind.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.800]   And it's the same decision that the guy in Mark 10
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.080]   had to make, and instead of weighing the scales
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.280]   and kind of going, "Ah, Jesus, or all my stuff,"
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.900]   and choosing the stuff sadly, and being like,
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.160]   "Well, I guess I'm committed, sorry."
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.800]   The guy just rushes off in his joy.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.920]   He's glad, he's happy, and he knows he wins.
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.280]   He walks away knowing he won.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.240]   He's dead broke.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.320]   He's got no arms full of money and two arms full of Christ.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.200]   And he's like, "I win."
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.900]   In his joy, he went and sold all he had.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.660]   What's the lesson about happiness?
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:40.500]   That having Jesus will actually make you happier
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.480]   than chasing money.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.820]   That's different than just saying
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.100]   Jesus is worth more than money,
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.500]   'cause that's just a fact out there somewhere.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.500]   But Jesus actually affects your emotions
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.780]   more positively than money.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.620]   You see this happy guy compared to the sad guy
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.860]   who walked away and lost?
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.380]   Christ is fulfilling.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.940]   Christ is everything our souls desire.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.980]   And he has the effect on us that we're hoping money will do,
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.760]   only to wind up disappointed over and over again.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.520]   And what is the lesson about reacting to Jesus?
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.520]   That it is normal to make inconvenient personal changes
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   in reaction to Christ.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.420]   I'm gonna say that again.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.600]   It is normal to make really inconvenient changes
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.080]   in reaction to Christ.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.120]   If it's generosity and giving, I'm in.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.820]   If it's a breakup, I'm in.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.740]   If it's changing jobs, I'm in.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.380]   If it's church membership, I'm in.
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.520]   This is what devotion sounds like.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.160]   If it's letting my family think I'm crazy, I am in.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.620]   When we meet Christ, we do the thing
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.960]   that the rich guy couldn't do.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.260]   Turn loose of whatever you have to turn loose of
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.300]   to get your arms around Christ.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.580]   You need to know people really do this.
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.920]   Because if you feel like the only one,
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.040]   and you feel like you're getting ready
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.700]   to make some crazy, radical step of obedience
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.960]   that just seems like you're going where no man
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.220]   or no woman has ever gone before,
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.140]   you just need to know people do this around you
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.800]   all the time.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.680]   They are rearranging their lives around Christ all the time.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.100]   I was talking to my friend about this verse.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.460]   And she said, "You know, I made this choice.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.900]   "I lived out that example."
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.460]   Matthew 13, 44, I did that.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.400]   She said, "That's me.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.740]   "I was living large, Jesus interrupted my life.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.700]   "I gave up a pretty good husband option.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.280]   "I knew my family would think I'd lost my mind.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.160]   "I knew my friends would think I had gone crazy
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.820]   "and joined a cult, but I went and I followed Christ anyway."
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.820]   She works on staff here at the cult now.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:46.100]   I said, "Did making that choice make you happy?"
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.800]   And she looked at me like, "Obviously.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.080]   "I'm fulfilled, I'm well.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.880]   "I let go of the golden handcuffs.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.360]   "I got them off of me because wealth
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.120]   "and everything that was involved in it,
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.640]   "what I thought would make me wealthy,
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.520]   "all the decisions I thought would bring fulfillment
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.660]   "to my life, I knew they were an illusion.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.680]   "And I went after something real.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.080]   "And it changed me, fulfilled me."
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.640]   That's a real experience, it's going on all around you.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:16.640]   And look, if you don't know what to do with your money,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.680]   if you're right there, if you're there
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.780]   and you're like, "Give me something practical.
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.820]   "Like, give me something to do.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.900]   "What should I do with my money?
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.000]   "Like, I wanna know what to do."
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.140]   Here's what you should do.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.000]   You should do everything you have to do
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.840]   to make sure you're the second person
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.880]   that you take option two, whatever it takes.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.240]   That's what you should do.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.200]   I can't choose for you.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.840]   And I know that there's nothing I can do to convince you.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.140]   And I know that if you're committed to chasing money,
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.760]   I know that my words are only gonna speed up your certainty,
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.900]   that that's gonna satisfy you.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.120]   But if you're willing, if you have the ears to hear
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   and the eyes to see the value of Christ,
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.440]   I wanna plead with you, make whatever choice
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.000]   you have to make to make sure that you go the way
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.280]   of option two, which is to invest money,
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.040]   to be joyful and to love Christ.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.080]   Not to miss Christ,
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.920]   because you were already prior committed.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.260]   It's so subtle and it's so dangerous.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.880]   Whatever it takes.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.720]   If you need to get away from shopping, get away.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.080]   If you need to drop Amazon Prime,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.860]   sorry, I'm going there, get away.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.460]   If you need someone else to see your paycheck
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.560]   so they can give you some guidance
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.600]   and give you some accountability, let 'em have it.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.040]   Add 'em to your bank account.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.920]   If you need to give money away
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.880]   just to prove to yourself that you're willing,
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.720]   God doesn't need your money.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.120]   God's not paycheck to paycheck.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.940]   He doesn't need your money,
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.240]   but you might need to give some away
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.480]   just to prove to yourself that he doesn't own you,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.520]   because the things you own might own you.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.640]   If you need to get rid of some luxury item you bought,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.460]   do it.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.300]   One time I was in college,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.600]   I saved up some money to buy a pair of shoes.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.680]   I went to the mall.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.360]   I'd been walking with Christ about two years,
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   which is not long and not well, for the record.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.840]   But I went in, I picked up these shoes.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.040]   I got 'em.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.320]   I like Air Force Ones, all white.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.160]   That's just me.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.800]   I'm not from North Dallas.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.200]   So I went and picked 'em up.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.240]   I didn't have enough money to do it.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.400]   It wasn't wise.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.240]   And I knew it.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.080]   And I kinda felt uneasy.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.000]   You know those moments where you're like,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.080]   okay, it's not a face-to-face meeting with Jesus
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.760]   where he's saying, go right and you go left.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.600]   It's not that.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.560]   It wasn't that clear.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.640]   It wasn't that obvious.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.480]   But I just felt a little uneasy in my spirit.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.920]   And then just in this little insignificant moment
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.940]   of making this small purchase
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.680]   that I might've had a clear conscience about it
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.720]   any other time for whatever reason I was uncomfortable with.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.240]   So I walked away with the shoes.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.760]   And then I was driving home.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.600]   I paid for 'em.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.440]   But I was walking away.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.440]   And I was driving home.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.600]   And I just knew, I'm like, that was a disobedient.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.040]   Every spending decision is a spiritual decision now.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.160]   I'm walking with Christ now.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.600]   Everything I do, every time I spend, every time I save,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.040]   that's a spiritual choice now.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.240]   And I just made a spiritual choice to enrich myself.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.560]   And I got shoes, man.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.560]   It's okay.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.720]   So I turned around and I took 'em back.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.320]   And the woman was like, wrong style.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.640]   And I was like, no, I'm a Christian.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.480]   I can't have this.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.300]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.140]   (congregation laughing)
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:55.980]   I didn't do that.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:56.800]   I didn't do that.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.280]   And Jesus doesn't want us walking around barefoot.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.440]   But he does want us walking around in obedience to him.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.400]   In the small things, in the big things.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.120]   He wants to own your heart.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.760]   And it is this clear.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.420]   I know some of you, you're just like,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.360]   I'm not an option one or option two guy.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.080]   You know, isn't there like a middle road?
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   And I'll just tell you,
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.040]   Jesus said no one can serve two masters.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.540]   And if you try, you've already picked your master.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.400]   It's not him.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.520]   I wanna finish by telling you a choice
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.080]   that my friend Eric made recently.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.560]   Eric is a friend of mine.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.320]   Eric just came onto the leadership circle
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.280]   at the porch in Fort Worth just recently,
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   this month actually.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.480]   And a little backstory on Eric.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.360]   Eric's only been walking with Christ for a few years now.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.760]   He's known about Christ for longer than that.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.020]   But what happened was he continued to move around
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.480]   with his job in a way that prevented him
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.000]   from having any stability.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.680]   He would move so often
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.940]   that he said it was kind of like Vegas.
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.100]   Like he could wake up every morning
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.040]   and just be a new person to whoever was in front of him.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.280]   'Cause he was in a new place all the time,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.720]   new people all the time.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.120]   Job moved him to Hawaii, Sedona, Flagstaff, Phoenix,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.420]   Los Angeles, Orange County, Seattle, and Dallas.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.120]   And in every place, he woke up, did whatever he wanted,
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.240]   partying, sleeping around, drugs, alcohol,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.560]   whatever he wanted, that's where he was living.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.020]   At some point, he picked up Christ along the way.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.320]   And by the time he landed in Fort Worth,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.780]   he decided to do something a little bit different.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.140]   He decided to put down roots in a local church.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.060]   He knew, and I've heard him say it over and over,
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.120]   that he needed to be receiving the love and care
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.220]   and counsel from other people.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.160]   And he wanted to give that kind of love and care
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.860]   and counsel to others as well.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.040]   He needed people pouring into him, vice versa.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.600]   He needed to experience community.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.100]   He needed to experience guidance.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.400]   He wanted to lead others and be led.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.280]   And so he dove into the water market, Fort Worth,
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.280]   and his life just starts to change, quick.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.540]   Glaring sin, just falling out of his life, left and right.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.460]   Clear conscience, prospering in his relationships,
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.920]   building trust like crazy.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.380]   He called me the other day and he said,
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.060]   "Hey, my job, they just offered me a big promotion,
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.660]   "like two steps up."
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.620]   Like words like executive thrown around kind of thing.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.260]   "And they offered me a couple hundred grand,
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.440]   "but it's not in Fort Worth.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.820]   "What would I do?
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.740]   "What should I do?"
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.780]   And some of you are like,
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.780]   "Dude, I know what you should do.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.780]   "They got churches everywhere.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:30.840]   "You go and tithe big if you need to.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.560]   "Like if it makes you feel better, you tithe big.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.840]   "But dude, you need to get on that."
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.740]   And he said, "I'm just gonna, I'm gonna think about it."
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.860]   He called me back a few days later and he said,
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.100]   "I walked in and I told my bosses,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.300]   "I said, guys, I wanna work hard for you.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.960]   "I wanna build this company with you.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.780]   "I'm glad you believe in me, even though I'm in my 20s
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.420]   "and you want to bring me into your inner circle like that.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.420]   "But there are things in my personal life,
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.680]   "my spiritual life, if you wanna know,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.940]   "that are holding me here.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.460]   "I've got some spiritual momentum in my life
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.860]   "that I've never had before.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.060]   "And I can't leave that.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.300]   "It's worth more."
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.000]   In other words, my priorities aren't for sale.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.900]   They're not for purchase.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.180]   I can't be bribed or bought,
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.340]   and I know that's not what they were trying to do.
[00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.160]   But I can't be swayed from the course that I'm on.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.420]   God's doing a good thing in me right now.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.980]   And maybe it might even be right for some other person
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.260]   to receive a promotion and receive a massive raise
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.900]   and to just go and do that thing in that new place.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.500]   And that might be totally freedom for them,
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.260]   but that's bondage for me, and I'm staying right here
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:42.620]   'cause I don't wanna be hasty
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.260]   to lead the presence of the King.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:49.820]   And I said, "Well, congrats, Eric, you're rich.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.800]   "Way richer than the people
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.500]   "who are still playing this game."
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:57.740]   And if they had added two zeros and offered you again,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.700]   and you said no, you'd still be rich
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.460]   because you know what leads to life.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.940]   You know that Christ is worth more than everything else.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.760]   And even though Christ is in every place,
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.500]   you know, according to Him, that He's got you in this place
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.340]   and you were willing to walk in that obedience
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.800]   even though it was expensive.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.100]   This is how we take over the world
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.820]   in the name of Christ, friends.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.100]   Did you know that every week,
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.420]   over 30,000 people listen to the porch?
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.320]   Did you know that?
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.820]   And the way, you go, "Well, what do you do?
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.020]   "What do you do with 30,000 people?"
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.860]   I'll tell you what you do.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.460]   You show up to work with your friends
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.080]   in social situations,
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.280]   and you show up, instead of striving,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.880]   you show up content.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.120]   You show up satisfied.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.360]   You show up fulfilled in Christ already
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.660]   so that you aren't on the rat race treadmill
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.840]   of trying to get more like everybody else is.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.120]   And eventually, those heads will turn one at a time
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.100]   in the hallway and in holidays with your family,
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.360]   one text message at a time,
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.260]   and they'll go, "What is it with you?"
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.280]   "What do you want?"
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.500]   And you can say, "I have what I want.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.320]   "I have Christ.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.840]   "I don't need anything else."
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.980]   And I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.660]   I'm not telling you Jesus wants you to quit your job
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.620]   and money's not important.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.100]   I don't wanna downplay the whole thing.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.260]   You need to be a member of society.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.500]   That probably means having a job at this point.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.300]   But it's not going to fulfill your soul.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.180]   It might steal it if you're not careful.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.580]   And Christ says, even though it's hard for the wealthy
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.220]   to enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.580]   he says, "With man, this is impossible,
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.740]   "but with God, it's possible."
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.160]   And I want that miracle for you and for me tonight,
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.420]   that we wouldn't miss the kingdom of heaven,
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.540]   not just on a permanent basis regarding heaven.
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.020]   I'm talking about missing the kingdom of heaven
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.840]   that we get to participate in right now
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.040]   if we're willing to make obedient, careful,
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.960]   alert choices to our real master,
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.200]   'cause we can't serve two, that doesn't work.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:16.880]   And if we do, all across this nation and this world,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.540]   people will start to rise up who say,
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.520]   "I don't need more, I have enough.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.900]   "What I need more of is purpose.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.080]   "What I need more of is God.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.240]   "What I need more of is love in my heart
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.880]   "so that I can extend it to other people.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.320]   "That's what I need more of."
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.080]   And when you have that, you are rich.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.520]   The scripture says, "Godliness with contentment
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.720]   "is great gain."
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.940]   Godliness with contentment is great gain,
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:42.200]   not godliness with a killer resume.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.920]   Godliness with contentment is great gain.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.360]   If you wanna get ahead, try contentment.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   See what God does for you.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   Let's pray together.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.580]   God, do the miracle in our hearts
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.840]   that we're not strong enough to do ourselves.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.320]   Help us fall out of love with our possibilities
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.040]   and our freedom and our shoes
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.960]   and all the things that just come out of our hearts.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.520]   Will you detach our love and our worth
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.600]   and our affections from our possessions,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.560]   the ones we have or the ones we just want?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.440]   Help us want you.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.260]   God, we're here and our prayer is we want a new want.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.880]   We want you.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.300]   We wanna represent you.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.160]   Thank you that you love us enough to look right at us
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.400]   and say, "Hey, that thing you love more than me,
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.240]   "that one's gotta go."
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.100]   Whether it's money or a relationship
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:47.080]   or habit or an addiction or some piece of bitterness,
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.760]   whatever it is that we have,
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.440]   you look us right in the face, God,
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.540]   and you tell us that has gotta go
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.720]   so that I can be number one where it matters.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.160]   God, help us to honor you in every single way.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.760]   In Christ's name, amen.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   Amen.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:12.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
