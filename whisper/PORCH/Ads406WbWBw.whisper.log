[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   [Music]
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.500]   All right, here we go.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.200]   Another week of the porch.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   My name is Josiah, and we are so glad that you're here joining us tonight from our Porch
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.480]   Live locations, the Porch Live Indianapolis in Greater Lafayette, Indiana, the Porch Live
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.600]   Midland, Texas, and my friends from Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.440]   Great hanging out with you guys last week.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   That was amazing.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.000]   And then finally, not to forget, my friends right here in Dallas, Texas.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Come on.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.880]   Hey, can I just say this?
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.160]   Like y'all are the faithful ones.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.000]   We got tornadoes happening around us, bad storms here in Dallas, and y'all are here.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   So let's go.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640]   I mean, y'all are ready to lean in.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.360]   JD, I think they're ready, bro.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.960]   Well, hey, we have been in a series titled On God, Standing Firm in the Mist of Trials,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.080]   standing firm in our faith when things are shaky.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.000]   And we've been studying in the book of Daniel.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.400]   And really, man, we've talked about having a fiery faith.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.960]   And in a culture that is crumbling around us, how do we have a faith that is immovable?
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   Last week, we talked about David's, talked about this idea that, hey, it's not about
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.600]   us.
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.280]   The root of all sin is pride.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.840]   I encourage you to check that message out.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.320]   It was incredible.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.760]   And tonight, we're pulling up to Daniel chapter 6.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.840]   But before we get there, I thought I'd just start out with a story.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.240]   Several months ago, I woke up to just finding out that I had been robbed.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.920]   I don't know if you've ever been robbed, but this was my first time.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   And it was when my family and I were sleeping, so it's kind of eerie.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.640]   And listen, this is the crazy thing, man.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.000]   My dog sleeps like right next to the garage wall, and they had opened our garage, and
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.840]   that brother didn't even wake up.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.880]   It's like, what is going on?
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.320]   And so I walk into my garage only to find out that we had thousands of dollars of stuff
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.400]   stolen from us.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.280]   And so, listen, I'm on edge, y'all, like I'm just him.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.320]   And so several days later, I'm doing some work in my living room on my computer.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.720]   I'm trying to wrap up the night, and it's like 1 a.m.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.000]   I'm just kind of that late night owl kind of guy.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.600]   And I go to lock my front door, and lo and behold, I just peek out the window.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.640]   And I see a car rolling up, and they're kind of on the other side of the curb.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.080]   I'm like, "Oh, here we go, man.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   I found the culprit.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.280]   Oh, honey, grab the gun."
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   And so I got the gun.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.760]   No lie, I got the gun right next to my front door.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.680]   And I'm about to just be bold, right?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.400]   I'm coming out to the front porch, and I see this brother.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.880]   He's a young adult getting out of his car, and he's walking on the sidewalk just a few
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   houses down.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.200]   I'm like, "Man, this is sketch, man."
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.760]   And I was like, "Hey, bro, what are you doing?"
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.000]   And he said, "Josiah?"
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.080]   I said, "Whoa, how do you know me?"
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.360]   He's like, "Oh, I go to the porch."
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.120]   I'm like, "Ah, even better.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.440]   Okay, okay.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.960]   So hey, what are you doing, man, at 1 a.m.?
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.600]   I just got robbed a few days ago."
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.800]   So I'm kind of on edge and a little salty.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.000]   So hey, why don't you come on over here to my front porch, and we can talk, okay?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Let's do that.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.360]   And so lo and behold, he said, "Hey, man, I was just going to my girlfriend's parents'
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   house."
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   I'm like, "Oh, parents' house.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   Okay, okay, cool."
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   So she's still in college.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   Oh, yeah, yeah, she's in college.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   Okay.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   So we begin to talk, and I'm like, "So what were you doing at...what were you going to
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   do at your girlfriend's parents' house?"
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   And I was like, "Do her parents know?"
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   And he's like, "Ah, no, not really."
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.800]   And I said, "Hey, look here, bro, it's late.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   I got two little girls.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.240]   They're only five and three sleeping in the back of the bedroom.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.240]   Do you think when they get older, I'm going to want some man showing up to my house,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.400]   and I don't know?
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   I don't know that man?"
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.000]   He's like, "Yeah, probably not."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.360]   And so, no lie.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.560]   And so we're just having a frank conversation, and I just said, "Hey, look, man, I'm tired.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   You're tired.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   And here's the deal, man.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.400]   Here's the invitation.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   If you want to be God's man, I'd love to meet up with you at a later date, but what you
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.360]   were about to go do at your girlfriend's parents' house is not God's best for you.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.560]   So here's the deal, man.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.280]   You're calling yourself a follower of Jesus.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.160]   I'm calling myself a follower of Jesus.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.720]   Listen, I would love to talk to you about what it means to be God's man, and I got a
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.160]   ways to go, bro, but I've been following him for about 15 years, and I'd love just to take
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.600]   you to lunch."
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.560]   And so a few days pass, and lo and behold, I get this email out of nowhere, and this
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   is what it reads.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.040]   "Josiah, I would love to set up a time to meet with you.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.120]   I'm interested in understanding what it means to live like a true man of God.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.440]   Thanks."
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.640]   And so I start there tonight because as we open the book of Daniel, chapter 6, we're
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.640]   going to talk about what it looks like to be a man and a woman of character.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.320]   Because I share that story with you tonight because in a sense, I was just saying, "Hey,
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.240]   man, if you really want to learn what it looks like to be a man or woman of character, you're
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.880]   in your case a man, but if you want to be a man of character, then let's talk."
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.840]   And tonight, I have to believe that you come into this place, tornadoes are happening around
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.960]   us, and you're hungry for God's Word.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.080]   You're hungry to lift up the name of Jesus.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.680]   Some of you, for the first time, you're like, "Man, what does it really mean to follow Jesus?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.480]   What does it really mean to be this man of character that this guy's talking about?"
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.680]   And so you're in a good place tonight here at the porch.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.440]   We're going to be in Daniel, chapter 6.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.140]   If you have your Bibles, you can open them up.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.400]   And Daniel 6 is going to challenge us to be a man or a woman of character.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.580]   So you see, everything rises and falls on character.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.920]   Like you want to be a great friend, then you got to have high character.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.860]   You don't want to be that friend that talks bad about someone behind their back only to
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.200]   boost up your, you know, self-esteem.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.780]   Or you want to be a good coworker, you want to be a good boss, you don't want to get sent
[00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.300]   to jail for fraud, business fraud.
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.160]   You got to have high character.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.460]   You want to be a man or a woman who stands the test of time in your marriage, you got
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.860]   to be a man of character, a woman of high character.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:52.820]   You want to be a great dad or a mom someday to your kids, then you got to be a great man
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.740]   or woman of character.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.180]   And so tonight we're talking about what it looks like to be a man or woman of character.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.220]   I want to point out three things from this text that mark a man or woman of character.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.780]   We're going to see this transfer of power that happens several years later from King
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.340]   Nebuchadnezzar who we've been studying about the last few weeks in the book of Daniel to
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.780]   now King Darius' new empire.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.740]   At the end of Daniel 5, there's this transfer of power from King Nebuchadnezzar to King
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.740]   Darius.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.140]   We're going to pick it up in chapter 6.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.140]   Here we go.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:35.620]   Darius the Mede decided to divide the kingdom into 120 provinces and he appointed a high
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.500]   officer to rule over each province.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:46.020]   The king also chose Daniel and two others as administrators to supervise the high officers
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.900]   and protect the king's interests.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.380]   But Daniel proved himself to be more capable than all the other administrators and high
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.780]   officers.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:02.100]   Because of Daniel's great ability, the king made plans to place him over the entire empire.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:06.340]   Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.060]   of Daniel, in the way he was handling government affairs, but they couldn't find anything to
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.580]   criticize or condemn him of.
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.960]   See, it's funny that when you're a man or woman of character and people can't point
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.740]   out anything in you that might be wrong, then what do they do?
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.180]   Let's keep reading.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.380]   He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy, so they concluded, "Our only
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:35.260]   chance of finding grounds for accusing Daniel will be in connection to the rules of his
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.260]   religion."
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:42.220]   See, when they can't point out anything in your character, then they will attack your
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.440]   God.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.900]   They will attack your faith.
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.900]   Why?
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.000]   Because Daniel was committed to God and not man.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.820]   How do you become a man or woman of character in the middle of a crisis that maybe you find
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.500]   yourself in at work where, hey, they can't attack who you are, but they might be able
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.900]   to attack your God?
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.860]   You commit to God and not man.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.220]   Men and women of character are always committed to God and not man.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.380]   Why is it important that men and women of character stay committed to God and not man?
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.600]   This is why it's important, because the circumstances of life, the circumstances of my life and
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.200]   your life, they change.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.320]   They come and go.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.380]   There's things that happen in your world that are constantly changing around you and around
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.940]   me.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.160]   But the Bible says that Jesus never changes.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.540]   He's the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:44.980]   If we're going to be a man or woman of character, then we have to commit to Him and not to man
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.620]   who changes, just like the wind.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.860]   Do you think Daniel wanted to work for a king that enslaved him?
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:10:01.020]   Do you think he wanted to get plucked out of his family and now be a slave to King Darius?
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.380]   No.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:09.280]   He had his entire identity removed, and now he finds himself working for an unruly and
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.420]   a pagan king.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.420]   But what does he do?
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.340]   He stays committed.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.420]   How did he stay committed despite his circumstances?
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:25.860]   Daniel chose to believe that God had him right where he was for a reason.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.220]   You might find yourself in the midst of some circumstances tonight, and the temptation
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:38.260]   is to believe that, man, God's got it wrong, or God can't be trusted.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:45.380]   We're going to find out in this story that, no, God sometimes puts us in harm's way, in
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.740]   painful situations, to be a fork in the road for the people that He's placed us in front
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.900]   of.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.320]   So he was able to display the character of Christ by working with the spirit of excellence
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.300]   for King Darius.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:05.460]   Because he wasn't working for King Darius, he was working for the ultimate king.
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:12.620]   See, that's the key to be a man or woman of character in the midst of an ever-changing
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.620]   world.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.780]   Colossians 3.23 says, "Whatever you do, whatever happens in your life, work as though you're
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.260]   working for the Lord and not human masters."
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.940]   Whatever's going on in your world, you don't work as though you're working for a human
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.220]   institution or a human master.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.500]   You work as though you're working for the Lord with all of your heart.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.780]   This was Daniel's life.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.180]   You see, when God is the why behind the what, then the how remains the same.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:43.580]   See, the how you work should be informed by the why, not the what.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:48.460]   See, the why is always, it's always followed.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:55.580]   When your why is to seek God and not man, then what follows is you working for God and
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.580]   not for any man.
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:03.180]   So when the man changes, when the human institutions change, when the things of this world change,
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.380]   your why always stays the same because you're working for God and not man.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.780]   Galatians 1.10 says, "Am I trying to win the approval of man or of God?
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.300]   If I was trying to win the approval of man, then I'd never be a servant of Christ."
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:22.460]   You ever had a boss, just like a bad boss?
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.460]   Some of you are like, "Yeah, it's all too real."
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.420]   Maybe this boss, he calls you into his office and says, "Hey, you're going to get the raise,
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.860]   the raise that you've always wanted, right?"
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.620]   The raise you've been working for, but under one condition.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.900]   "Hey, I messed up our yearly report, so I need you to fudge these numbers."
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:48.180]   And in that moment, you have to decide, "Is the raise more important than who I'm really
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.460]   working for, what God has called me to do?"
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:13:02.420]   Or maybe it's a relationship where someone wants you to compromise sexually, and they're
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:07.340]   just saying sweet nothings and saying everything you want to hear and doing the things that
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:13.460]   you've always wanted that man or woman to do, but you know what God's called you to
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.460]   do.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:20.540]   He's called you to pursue a life of purity so that you can be one with your husband or
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.620]   your wife someday.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:31.260]   Maybe it's a parent who wants you to pursue a career, right?
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:40.020]   That you know that God is not calling you to pursue, but you're in the middle of conflict
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.140]   because your parents have always dreamed of you being this or that, and now you find yourself
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:53.580]   in the middle of, "Hey, do I please my parents or do I please what God has called me to do?"
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.580]   Maybe it's friends.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:01.940]   I know for me, after I committed my life to Jesus at 21, I remember distinctly getting
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.500]   phone calls from just people that I'd go out with and party.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:11.260]   I just knew, man, my thing, my ditch was alcohol, and so I could never just drink two.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.180]   I always had to drink eight or nine or 10, and man, I just had this addictive personality
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.620]   that when I go all in, I'm all in.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.620]   So it's good.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.660]   When I came to Christ, I'm all in.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.220]   Hey, no one's getting in this.
[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.100]   No one's talking me out of this.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.540]   I remember getting a phone call saying, "Hey, Josiah, you want to go out?"
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.420]   I remember specifically just wrestling with this desire where, man, I was like, "Yeah,
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.420]   man, I want to go out.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.860]   I believe I'm strong enough.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:46.420]   I got this," but then only falling prey to the very thing that would call my name over
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.300]   and over and over in the years past.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.300]   Maybe that's you.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:55.180]   You know you're not strong enough, but you're fighting the approval of man.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.980]   You're fighting the approval of what these people think about you when you know you can't
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.940]   stand up against that temptation.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.780]   See, we all have people in our life that we seek to please, but that is why men and women
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.900]   of character aren't categorized by people pleasing.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:16.900]   They're categorized by what does my God think?
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.900]   How about you?
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.900]   How about you?
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.820]   Are you committed to God or man?
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:28.300]   When you and the Bible disagree, who wins?
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.300]   Nervous laughter.
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.300]   Right?
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.620]   When you and the Bible disagree, who wins?
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.620]   Maybe.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.820]   It's easy for us to say when we just got done singing Jesus songs, and we're in this controlled
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:50.340]   temperature environment with the cushioned seats, and it's amazing.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.140]   See the problem with our generation, I believe, is that we form our commitments by our feelings,
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.980]   not forming our commitments by what this book has to say.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:04.860]   Instead of someone saying amen, someone needs to say ouch.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.860]   Because that's true, right?
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.620]   We form our commitments by our feelings, not our commitments by the truth of God's word.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.100]   I remember one of the first times this played out in my relationship with my mom.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.260]   This is probably why I struggle with people pleasing.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:24.860]   Because when I was going into the sixth grade, my mama walked out on us.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.060]   Some of you, you got daddy wounds.
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.820]   I got a mama wound.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.300]   I just remember her leaving.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.620]   All I wanted was to seek her approval.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:39.340]   I remember her walking out and just saying, "Hey, I'm done."
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:45.580]   The divorce was finalized, and I found myself a couple years later with my dad, and a stepmom,
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.380]   and stepchildren, a blended family, and doing that whole thing.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.740]   The hard part about this relationship is that she's never owned her part.
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.780]   But am I going to be conformed to my feelings, because my feelings say, "Man, I got bitterness.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.380]   I got resent for days.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.820]   I'm angry."
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:14.780]   Or does God's word say, "Because of Jesus, and because of all your sins, Josiah, he loves
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:20.060]   you in spite of your sin, and he forgives you when you ask."
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:24.980]   Do I take that same forgiveness that he's granted to me, and do I extend that to my
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.660]   mom?
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.520]   For those of you that are in relationships or been hurt by people, and they've never
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.900]   owned their part, how do you deal with that?
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:38.620]   You deal with that by every day, before my feet hit the ground, my knees hit the ground,
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.700]   I say, "God, hey, I know that I'm prone to anger when something doesn't go my way, when
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.380]   someone doesn't meet my expectation.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.380]   I know I'm prone to anger because of this mama wound.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.980]   So will you forgive me for being prone to this anger, and I forgive my mom, even though
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.140]   she hasn't forgiven me.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.160]   I'm going to walk out that play every single day, and the moment I choose not to forgive
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.460]   my mom, then listen, I'm going to hold something against that person that wrongs me, and I'm
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.460]   going to explode."
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:11.740]   How about you?
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:21.920]   Is your commitment based on your feelings, or is it based on what this book says?
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.520]   This was Daniel's life, and as a result, the text says, "He was a man who proved himself
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.600]   more capable than all other workers in King Darius's kingdom."
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   Why?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   Because he was full of integrity.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.740]   He did what was right when no one was looking.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.740]   He was a man of skill.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.500]   He had a hard work ethic.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:45.540]   He had a spirit of excellence, faultless and faithful, always responsible, completely trustworthy.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.720]   He was committed to God and not man.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.400]   People didn't like that about King Darius.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:58.960]   King Darius loved Daniel because of his character, but the people around him ... When you're
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.840]   a man or woman of character, the people around you hate you because you expose their evil
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.960]   deeds.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.240]   As we continue to read, if they can't point out things in his character, then they will
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.720]   attack his God.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.920]   There's no middle ground.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.160]   This is how you and I take a stand in today's culture.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:25.520]   If you don't stand for something, I'm telling you, you're going to fall for everything.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   Let's keep reading.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.360]   "The administrators," verse 6, "and high officers went to the king and said, 'Long live the
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   king.'"
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   We're all in agreement.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.720]   We administrators, officials, high officers, advisors, and governors, are we all in agreement?
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.080]   Because I don't know if Daniel is.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.680]   Look what he's about to say.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.520]   "That the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:54.240]   Give orders that over the next 30 days, any person who prays to anyone divine or human,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.200]   except to you, O king, your majesty will be thrown into the den of lions.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.400]   And now your majesty issue and sign this law so it cannot change.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.600]   An official law of the Medes and the Persians that can't be revoked."
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   What did King Darius do?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.440]   Because he's prideful and he's a pagan, he's an unbeliever?
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.080]   He signs it.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.920]   He's like, "Oh, that sounds pretty good.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.640]   Instead of people praying to all these other gods, why don't they just pray to me and I'll
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.640]   just be God."
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.800]   Hey, don't blame King Darius.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.640]   We do that every day.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.960]   We do that every day when we steal glory from God for the things that we're experiencing
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:41.320]   in our life and we point to us as the ones who get the glory.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.000]   Continuing in verse 10, "But when Daniel learned that the law had been signed, he went
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.880]   home and knelt down as usual in his upstairs room with his windows open towards Jerusalem.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:55.120]   He prayed three times a day just as he always done, giving thanks to God.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.960]   Then the officials went together to Daniel's house and found him praying and asking for
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.240]   God's help.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.880]   So they went straight to the king and reminded him about the law.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:09.200]   Did you not sign a law for the next 30 days that any person who prays to anyone divine
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.320]   or human except to you, your majesty, will be thrown into the den of lions?"
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.600]   The manipulation happening in this text.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.560]   "Yes," the king replied, "that decision stands.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.280]   It is the official law of the Medes and the Persians and it can't be revoked."
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.680]   Then they told the king, "That man Daniel, you know the one you love, the one of the
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.960]   captives from Judah, he's ignoring you and your law.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   He still prays to his God three times a day hearing this."
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.160]   The king was deeply troubled and he tried to think of a way to save Daniel.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.640]   He spent the rest of his days looking for a way to get Daniel out of this predicament.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:51.120]   In the evening, the men went together to the king and said, "Your majesty, you know that
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.840]   according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, no law that the king signs can be
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.480]   challenged.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.640]   Men and women of character are consistent despite any change."
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.200]   This is what we see in this text.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.800]   They're consistent despite change.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.360]   Look at what I mean by this.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.480]   Look at this for a second.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.720]   When I say consistent despite the change, look at what Daniel did.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.600]   When he had learned that the king had signed this law, that's the change that's happening
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.640]   in his culture.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.200]   He went home and he knelt down as usual in his upstairs room.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.240]   That's the consistency of who he is.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.000]   With the windows open toward Jerusalem, he prayed three times a day just as he always
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   had done.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.760]   That's consistency again, giving thanks to God.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.560]   That man Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, he's ignoring your law, he still prays
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.880]   to his God three times a day.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.320]   There you see consistency.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.200]   See he's consistent despite the change.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.800]   What does this show us?
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.760]   Despite whatever changes Daniel is facing, he's consistent.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.520]   Are you consistent?
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   When the culture around you is changing, when your friend group is changing, when things
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   are popping up in the news and things are changing around us, what is said about you?
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.760]   Do you change?
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.240]   Does your belief system change?
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:22.240]   Does your faith have a tendency to weaken or does it only embolden?
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.800]   See the law changed, the king changed, the people around him changed, but Daniel was
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   consistent.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.000]   Just like those things change, we see things around us changing every day.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.760]   You can decide your own truth now.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.920]   Hey, this book, man, it's not truth.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.360]   I mean it's just like one of many.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.040]   What's true for you is true for you.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.920]   What's true for me is true for me.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.880]   It's just relative truth.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.760]   You pick it, whatever truth works for you.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.420]   We see you can decide what gender you want.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:54.960]   Even Washington came out and said, "Hey, let's have kids be transgender.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.120]   Let's let them make that decision."
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.440]   But you can't drive till you're 16, you can't smoke till you're 18, you can't drink till
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.520]   you're 21, but I think it's a good idea to let kids pick their gender.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.880]   Where do you stand?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.760]   It's crazy.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:15.120]   Abortion, you can get aborted in the womb up to 24 weeks and some states are trying
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.840]   to lengthen that.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.560]   See you can't decide on what you believe in the moment.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.640]   You have to be consistent with who you are in Christ.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.580]   Are you consistent despite the change?
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.120]   If you're going to be a person of character, then you don't just go with the flow of culture.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.360]   Daniel's consistency to seek God prepared him for any changes that came his way.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.080]   In the same way, your habits today will prepare you for your decisions tomorrow.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.580]   Do you know that?
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:53.680]   The habits that you're creating today will prepare you for your decisions tomorrow, next
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:59.560]   month, next year, 10 years from now because you're just becoming more of who you are today.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.400]   Take a look at your life.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.360]   Do you like who you're becoming?
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.400]   Well then keep doing what you're becoming.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.520]   If you don't, man we're a fork in the road tonight.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.320]   You decide, you choose.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.780]   Because Daniel was true to his God, nothing was going to change his character because
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.780]   of his consistency.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.000]   Let me ask you something.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.020]   What consistent habits do you have right now in your life that are helping you become a
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.020]   man or woman of character?
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.500]   When you wake up, are you quick to scroll to Instagram or are you quick to run to this
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.020]   book?
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.180]   What would it look like, porch?
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.860]   What would it look like for the young adults in Dallas to filter every decision through
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.400]   this book?
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.660]   Every stance that you're going to take based on what culture says or what your friends
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.800]   say or what your boss says or your corporation says, what would it look like if you looked
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.500]   at every decision that you were going to make, every belief that you were going to hold on
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.780]   to and you filtered it through the Bible?
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.380]   Are you quick to open it up and say, "God, I'm your servant.
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.380]   I'm listening.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.380]   I'm going to do whatever you have for me."
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:15.340]   See, so many people want to know about God's will, but he's given us a written will to
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.460]   open up and read.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:25.460]   I believe that when you are faithful to obey his written will for your life, then he will
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   explain the will of God, where you're supposed to work, who you're supposed to marry, what
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:39.340]   church you're supposed to connect to, what does it look like to believe in today's society.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.820]   He's going to share those things with you.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.340]   He's going to show them to you.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.340]   How about prayer, man?
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.380]   What do we do three times a day, morning, noon, and lunch?
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.380]   We eat, man.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.380]   Come on.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.580]   Some of you all, like, stomach's growling right now.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.020]   You can't wait to get out of here and eat.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.300]   Hold up.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.980]   Daniel prayed three times a day.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.140]   He was consistent.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.020]   What does it look like for you to pray?
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.180]   What if you decided to get a notebook and you just began to jot out, "Hey, this is what
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.260]   I'm thankful for.
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.780]   God, this is what I want to see you do in my life."
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.740]   I was having coffee with JD the other day.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.380]   I'm like, "Bro, what are you doing right now?"
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.380]   He's like, "I'm praying."
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   I'm like, "Let me see that."
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.380]   He's like, "No, man.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.380]   You can't see my prayers."
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.380]   I'm like, "All right, cool.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.380]   Well, what are you doing?"
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.660]   He's like, "Well, I'm praying, and then I mark off the ones when I see God move in my
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.580]   life, when I see God answer those prayers."
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.580]   That's incredible.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.380]   What would it look like if you did that?
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.380]   Scripture memory.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.660]   The Bible says that one of the ways that we defeat the enemy in our life that's attacking
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.380]   us, the enemy that's prowling around like a roaring lion seeking to devour you and me,
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.300]   and for us to defeat the sin that lies within us and the world that's coming at us is by
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.900]   hiding the Word of God in our hearts.
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.220]   See, the Holy Spirit can't remind you of anything that you don't know.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.580]   Are you memorizing Scripture?
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:07.140]   I told you one of the sins that I have a tendency of committing is just being angry.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.060]   When somebody wrongs me, man, I just don't respond well.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:16.580]   I find these what I call fighter verses that help me in those moments when I want to lash
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:23.140]   out or I don't want to speak kindly to my kids or I have the wrong tone towards my wife.
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.380]   I just have these verses that I've written down and I'm starting to memorize so that
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:32.740]   the Holy Spirit can remind me in those moments when my flesh wants to take over.
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.140]   That's not the way of life, Josiah.
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.700]   That's the way of death.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.860]   How about church membership, man?
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.540]   Where are you?
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:45.700]   How can you really go all in when you're looking at church as like a buffet menu and you go
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.620]   over here for the worship, go here for the teaching, go here for the community, but you're
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.780]   not really all in and nobody's really shepherding you, no one's really caring for your soul.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.940]   I would just say, man, by God's grace, I've just submitted to the elders of this church
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.820]   and it doesn't have to be Watermark, but it has to be a church.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.120]   How can you really be a man or woman that's rooted and they know you and you know them
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:13.020]   if you're never fully bought in to a church?
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.660]   Being in community, every Friday morning I meet with these men at 6 a.m. and they know
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.940]   where I've been in thought, in word, and in action.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:26.940]   I'm able to confess those things knowing that I'm going to be fully loved in the midst of
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.820]   being fully known.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:37.380]   It's a beautiful picture of how I see Christ tangibly through these men that love me no
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.020]   matter where I've been, no matter what I've done.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.620]   They're able to help me grow and not fall into the same things over and over and over.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:52.580]   Do you have a track record of faithfulness or do you have a track record of brokenness?
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.580]   What is your track record?
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:59.660]   One of God's greatest provisions for your life and my life is that we would lock arms
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.660]   with other men.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:06.260]   And you ladies, you would lock arms with other women that love Jesus, aren't perfect, but
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.140]   want to be about His kingdom, that want to be about His business.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.640]   Where are you serving?
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:18.800]   Is it all about you when you come into this place like, "Feed me, feed me, feed me, God,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.820]   God's great," but then you never give back?
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:27.740]   You never serve, you never lay your life down, you never die to yourself and live for a bigger
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.460]   kingdom that will be without end?
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.940]   If you were to look at the last week or the last month of your life, where have you made
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.060]   spiritual deposits?
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:44.560]   Where the kingdom is furthering because of your gifts and because of your time and because
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.560]   of your treasures.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.800]   Like, how are you leveraging those things for the kingdom of God?
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:54.120]   The decisions you make today determine your tomorrow.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.860]   You know that?
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.160]   When tomorrow changes, the laws of the land change, the government changes, the culture
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.560]   changes, your friends at work change, will you?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:11.140]   The people of God maintain their witness to an evil world and are consistent despite any
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:16.580]   change by getting along with the Lord, by connecting with His people, and by serving
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.260]   those around them.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.460]   This is how Daniel stays consistent despite any change, even if it's meant thrown into
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.460]   the lion's den.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.460]   Let's continue.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:32.460]   Verse 16, "So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.180]   the den of lions.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.060]   The king said to him, 'May your God, whom you serve so faithfully, rescue you, Daniel.'
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.740]   A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:47.000]   The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles so that no
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.540]   one could rescue Daniel.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.580]   Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.340]   He refused his usual entertainment and couldn't sleep at all that night.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:04.180]   Very early the next morning, the king got up and hurried out to the lion's den.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.540]   When he got there, he called out in anguish, 'Daniel, Daniel, servant of the living God,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.380]   was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions?'
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.020]   Daniel answered, 'Long live the king.
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:21.820]   My God sent His angel to shut the mouths of the lions so they would not hurt me.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.260]   For I've been found innocent in His sight and I have not wronged you, Your Majesty.'
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.020]   The king was overjoyed and ordered Daniel to be lifted from the den.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:34.500]   Not a scratch was found on him for he had trusted in his God."
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:41.900]   What do you trust in when the darkness of life is upon you?
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.180]   When the lion's den of life is crouching at your door?
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.180]   Like what do you trust in?
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.700]   Do you run to that bottle?
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.220]   Do you run to that drug?
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.260]   Do you run to that relationship?
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:59.380]   Do you run to that business and just get caught up with more work and try to make more money?
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:09.140]   Like where do you run to when the lion's den of life is crouching at your door?
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.540]   When you're sitting there and you feel like darkness is all around you?
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:18.020]   See, men and women of character are courageous no matter the cost.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.740]   They're courageous no matter the cost.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:25.060]   See, did you see in verse 22, "My God sent His angel to shut the lion's mouth so they
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.060]   would not hurt me.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.860]   The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:37.620]   Not a scratch was found on him because he had trusted in God."
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:41.780]   Even to the point of death, nothing could shake this man.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.340]   How do we get there?
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.660]   We believe that God is true.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:52.020]   We believe that His promises are right and good.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:58.100]   We believe that this earth that we're living on is not the final destination.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.660]   Heaven is.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:05.460]   No matter what happens to Daniel, he believes that he wins.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.460]   It's what Paul had.
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:11.100]   The guy who wrote 3/4 of the New Testament, he says, "To live is Christ and to die is
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.180]   gain.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:16.460]   You can take my life, but if you take it, I'm going to heaven.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.220]   But to live, like wherever I'm going, I'm going to tell the world about Jesus no matter
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:25.020]   the cost because to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.380]   Do you have that mentality?
[00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.620]   Is this your mentality tonight?
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:40.620]   Because if it's not, then you got ground to take and I got ground to take in my life.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:48.700]   Have you ever been in a dark place and felt forgotten by God?
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:35:00.140]   Maybe you didn't get the job that you wanted or the promotion or the cancer was inevitable
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.780]   for a good family friend of yours.
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:10.820]   Or maybe it was that relationship that you thought was going to end in a marriage.
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   Or maybe for some of you, like, "Relationship, man?
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.540]   Where are the relationships?
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.540]   I ain't got those."
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.500]   I'm sorry, I'm praying.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.260]   There's a lot of people here at the porch.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.920]   Come on, somebody.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:32.020]   But don't trust them all because there are wolves in this place, okay?
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.260]   And just because they carry a Bible doesn't mean that they can be trusted.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:41.260]   But hey, I digress.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.340]   Have you ever been in a dark place?
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:52.540]   Like darkness, like a real place of darkness where you can hear the sounds of lions, like
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:58.020]   you can hear the wrestling in your spirit.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:06.120]   You know that this thing is going to lead to a place of horror for you if something
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.120]   doesn't change.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:12.700]   I told you, man, the first of that was my mom walking out on me.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.140]   And then I found myself at 30 years old and single and somebody looks at me and they're
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.740]   like, "I don't think this guy's ever had a romantic problem."
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.980]   It's like, "No, no, no."
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:29.100]   Listen, when I came to Christ at 21, there was a decade of singleness.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.060]   And I'm like, "God, I'm trying to do this thing."
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.540]   Where are you, man?
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.260]   Like when you don't think that God is working and you're working for Him but you're thinking
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:45.180]   that He should be working for you?
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:48.420]   Laying in my bed wondering, "Hey, am I always going to be single for the rest of my life?
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.500]   If I am, hey, I still win.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500]   I get heaven."
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:57.180]   It's a hard place to get to but I think that's where God wanted me to get to.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.180]   And then thankfully God allowed me to get married and we were about to have our first
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.260]   child, a little girl.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:10.340]   And I remember getting a phone call from the doctor saying, "Hey, she's got heart issues.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:15.060]   And if you decide to have her, then you're probably going to deal with heart issues for
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.580]   her entire life.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.580]   Do you want to abort her?"
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.580]   And I said, "What?
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:26.720]   Did I hear you right?"
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:33.080]   And then I remember a few years later walking into my house and my wife, man, she's strong,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.080]   man.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.080]   She's not a weeper.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.160]   She's not a crier.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.080]   And I just remember her just crying, like weeping uncontrollably.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.400]   And I'm like, "Baby, baby, what's wrong?
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   What happened?"
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.400]   And she said, "You're not going to believe this.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.640]   I just got a call from my sister.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.720]   She's got stage three colon cancer."
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:56.260]   And it felt like the air was sucked out of our entire house.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:02.360]   And I'm sitting here just consoling my wife who's weeping uncontrollably.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.600]   What are you doing in those moments when the darkness is closing in on you and you're like,
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.880]   "God, where are you?
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.240]   How am I supposed to continue this?"
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:21.000]   It's in the dark times where you have to rely on God.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.640]   Because man, it's easy to be courageous when there's no cost, right?
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.200]   Like it's easy to be courageous when life is good and it's easy to put that Bible verse
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:36.120]   on your Instagram bio and come into this place and sing praises to God and you know, you
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.520]   got the praise hands.
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.920]   But what about when darkness strikes?
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.440]   Because it's coming for us all.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.760]   Man, we live in a broken world, jacked up with sin and creation and the chaos and we
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:54.080]   see death and we see tornadoes and we see COVID and we see rape and murder and all the
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:57.400]   evil in this world.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.620]   You believe that God is real.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.600]   His promises are true.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.440]   And this earth is not our home.
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   There's heaven.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.680]   And my book, the book that I read, this Bible that I read in Revelation says, "Hey, there's
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.400]   coming a day when He's going to wipe every tear from your eye and my eye and the former
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.320]   things have passed away and He's going to make all things new and there's not going
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.240]   to be any more pain and suffering anymore."
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:27.040]   And so it's in those moments where you rely on God.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.120]   Where do you run to when the darkness settles in on your life?
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:38.600]   Do you rely on God?
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:43.880]   It's in the dark times of life where you get to proclaim that God is real because I'm telling
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   you man, when just everything's perfect, people look at you and they're like, "Oh yeah, I
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.440]   wonder why you believe in God."
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.800]   But it's in those dark times of life where the watching world is watching how you and
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:03.840]   I are going to respond to this tragedy, this brokenness.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:11.160]   And it can lead entire kingdoms and people to bend their knee before the living God.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   You believe that?
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:18.480]   Like when you don't act like everyone else acts in the office or you decide to stay home
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.080]   on the weekends instead of going out.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   I've been there.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:30.000]   I've been in the lonely nights of my apartment when I was single to 31 years old.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.160]   It's in those moments of darkness where you're able to share with the world who your God
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.960]   really is and it can change entire kingdoms.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.000]   Look at what verse 26 says.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.620]   "I decree," this is King Darius, "that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.000]   fear before," who?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.320]   "The God of Daniel."
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.880]   And then he goes on and says, "For he is the living God and he will endure forever.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.800]   His kingdom will never be destroyed and his rule will never end.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.240]   He rescues and saves people.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.220]   He performs miraculous signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth.
[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:13.720]   He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions and he can rescue you from what you're
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:14.720]   going through."
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:15.720]   It might not change.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.480]   Your circumstances might not change.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:28.760]   But tell me something, do we not have a God that has defeated sin and death?
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:33.480]   That he didn't just die on the cross but he defeated it three days later?
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.000]   There's no other religion that teaches that.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.200]   That's what separates Christianity from all other religions, that we have a God who's
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.200]   alive and powerful.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.440]   If he's dead, then what we're doing, man, is futile.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.960]   It does not matter.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.760]   We're wasting our time.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:51.160]   And so in summary, we see in this story that no matter what we face in life, no matter
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.760]   the outcome, God is looking for men and women of character.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.240]   Will you commit to be that man or woman?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:05.760]   Will you be consistent in your pursuit of him despite the changes in our culture?
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.520]   And will you finally respond with courage no matter the cost?
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.480]   This is what marks a man or woman of character.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.240]   As we close, land the plane.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.840]   You know what's so incredibly cool about this story?
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.680]   About the book of Daniel?
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.480]   Like Daniel, man, he couldn't save himself.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:36.000]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were tied up and thrown into the fiery furnace.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.860]   Like they couldn't save themselves.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.360]   Like they had to rely on God.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.800]   They had to rely on someone outside of themselves.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.680]   This is the whole purpose of the gospel, that you can't save yourself, that I can't save
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.680]   myself.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.160]   It doesn't matter what you do.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:57.360]   It doesn't matter how good of a person you think you are.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:04.000]   You can't save yourself.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.360]   This is why God sent his one and only son, Jesus, 2,000 years ago, to live the life that
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.480]   you and I could never live.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:20.280]   He was perfect in thought, word, and action, which made him the only eligible one to die
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.080]   on the cross for your sin and my sin.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.280]   A sinful man or woman can never do that.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.640]   And all of our sin went on him.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.760]   And he soaked up every last ounce of God's wrath, the wrath that should have been poured
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:39.260]   out on you and me because of our sin.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.120]   And he got what we deserve, and we get what he deserved.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.880]   It's called the great exchange.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:54.520]   And not only that, Scripture records and history says that three days later, he bursted forth
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:01.560]   from the grave to defeat the sting of sin and death.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.680]   And what we see in this story is that Jesus is the greater Daniel.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   Check this out for a minute.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.440]   Somebody else was misunderstood and had people plot against him to King Pilate.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.120]   That was Jesus.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:20.680]   Just like Daniel had people plot against him, right, to throw him into the lion's den, Jesus
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.920]   had people plot against him.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:28.520]   His own people turned against him to be crucified on the cross.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:34.400]   Just like Daniel was thrown into the lion's den and a stone placed over that den, Jesus
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:41.480]   was put in a tomb with a stone rolled over the tomb.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:52.000]   Just like Daniel, through the power of God, was rescued from the mouths of the lions,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.400]   the sting of death, not a scratch was found on him.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:02.900]   In the same way, Jesus bursted forth from the tomb Easter.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.920]   We happen to celebrate it this Sunday.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:06.600]   That's crazy, y'all.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.120]   That's nuts.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:14.440]   He bursted forth from the tomb three days later to defeat sin and death.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.800]   Like that's good news.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.120]   Like that's news that you can't muster up.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:27.200]   Like nobody can tell me that man wrote this book, that man wrote that story.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.100]   What do we do when we want justice?
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.360]   We take over.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.760]   We get the guns out, we get the fists up, and we're taking over.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:39.920]   No, Jesus came as a suffering servant to die on the cross for your sin and my sin.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.080]   This is what we have to do.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:52.920]   We have to bend the knee and say, "God, I recognize apart from you, I'm nothing.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.120]   I can't save myself.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.600]   Have you done that tonight?
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:06.000]   Have you made Jesus the leader of your life?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:13.820]   Do you commit to God and not man?
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:22.000]   Are you a man or woman who is consistent despite the changes happening in our culture?
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.480]   And are you courageous no matter the cost?
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.240]   Let me pray that you would tonight.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:43.000]   God in heaven, this is a story about a man who had high character, a man who stood the
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.280]   test of time no matter the circumstances of life.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.840]   And I believe tonight you're looking for a man or a woman among us, or whoever's listening
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:47:00.520]   to this message at a later date, you're looking for a man or a woman among us who's going
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.520]   to step into the character that you're calling them to.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.000]   But we can't do it apart from you.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   That's the crazy thing.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.520]   We can't be a man of high character, a woman of high character apart from you.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.040]   Eventually, it'll get exhausting.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   We'll fall.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:21.320]   And it won't end well.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:27.160]   Because there's none among us who's perfect and we need a perfect God.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:30.400]   And you became that through the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.600]   And I pray tonight that you would raise up some men and women who haven't trusted in
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.720]   you that tonight would be the night where they draw a line in the sand, they nail a
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.120]   stake in the ground, and they trust you for the very first time for the forgiveness of
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.480]   sins and life after death.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.840]   That they make you the leader of their life.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:58.320]   And for those of us that have done that, we would be moved to pursue you more and more
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.160]   and more no matter what life throws at us.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.920]   And we would see that you're going to use all of those moments of heart, all of those
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:16.240]   circumstances, all of the changes of culture to refine us and to grow us into the men and
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.960]   the women that you want us to be for your glory, our joy, and the world's good.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   Amen.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   - Yes, David, sing with us.
